<p><strong>david</strong>: Close her up, will you?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: There’s been a train crash near Santa
Barbara. They’re flying an aortal trauma here now. How can I ask you
this, David…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I can do it, Blake.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Is he crazy, Jasmine? He’s been on his feet
for fourteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: Chloe, it’s been this way since Leslie
died. Losing himself in his work, poor thing…</p>
<p>****: … I’ll give you something to lose yourself in…</p>
<p>****: Excuse me, miss?</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Miss?</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Very impressive. That is very… Did
anybody see that?</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Thank you. Could I bother you for a
little more…?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Skim, right? And half a pack, if I remember
correct…</p>
<p>****: You wanna try some turkey bacon on that?</p>
<p><strong>younger man</strong>: You want a tip when I’m through?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s your body…</p>
<p><strong>younger man</strong>: That’s right, so why don’t you get up
off it…</p>
<p><strong>older man</strong>: Wesley… I’ve told him the same thing.
Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Hi, Betty. You’re looking good…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Thanks, Roy, you’re sweet… a big liar, but
sweet. I liked your editorial this morning…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a
sense of history to…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole
idea of “church bake sales” in perspective…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You know, Elden, some people actually read more
than just the Classifieds…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Why don’t you go back to doing something
you’re good at… like that Lonelyhearts column? I’ll take a refill there,
Betty…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hey, Sheriff. How’s everything?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Oh, you know, the usual… keeping the world
safe.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … I meant your food.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Oh, right… ’s fine. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I thought you said the eggs weren’t…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: It’s fine. Mind your own meal…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You should get the order you want.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: And you should keep your nose out of
another man’s omelette… It’s no big deal, Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There’s yolks in there, huh? It’s no prob’…
gotta keep you on track.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been
eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass
me!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: They’re just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can
eggs be?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: … plenty</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Mind your own business. You just said that
shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Come on, guys, I told you it’s egg whites
only for the Sheriff… … I put him in that ‘zone’ thing.</p>
<p><strong>cook #1</strong>: Well, it better be a pretty good size zone
if he’s in it…</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Blake, I can handle that transplant!</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: We need someone with the right kind of
experience, Lonnie.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Even if he’s falling asleep on his feet?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: Lonnie, it’s a complex procedure. Why don’t
you observe?</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: I’m not some snot-nosed resident fresh out
of medical school, Blake.</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: No, you’re not. You’re a good doctor, Lonnie,
but you’re not David Ravell. I’ve made my decision. Now, if you’ll
excuse me …</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hey! We were watching that!</p>
<p><strong>cook #1</strong>: The other girls’ve got orders up… we’re not
one ’a them goddamn Nelson families, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s “Nielson”…</p>
<p><strong>cook #1</strong>: Yeah, well, we ain’t one ’a them,
neither.</p>
<p>****: Go on now…</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: When you gonna get those things fixed,
anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>cook #1</strong>: When you all quit watching ’em for a
living…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … alright, I get it, no more TV. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: On the goddamn internet, where else?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You’re joking…</p>
<p><strong>waitress #1</strong>: … nope, got him at “T.V. Hunks with
Sweet Little Asses.Com.”</p>
<p><strong>waitress #2</strong>: Seventy-five dollars…</p>
<p><strong>cook #1</strong>: … Seventy-eight fifty.</p>
<p><strong>waitress #2</strong>: C’mon, Betty! Pose with him!</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: One candle… uh-oh, you’re getting up there!
Doesn’t David like ’em young?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m over the hill, what can I say?</p>
<p><strong>waitress #1</strong>: A little something for those nursing
classes you’ve been wanting to take…</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: … but keep putting off thanks to a certain
husband we won’t mention…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, guys, you didn’t have to do that!</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: So how you gonna celebrate? Del takin’ you
into Wichita for a big fancy dinner?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yeah, Dairy Queen, maybe… Oh, I should
probably call him. Thanks, you guys…</p>
<p><strong>cook #1</strong>: Alright, alright, come on… I’m not running
no bed &amp; breakfast, we got customers. Let’s go…</p>
<p><strong>answering machine</strong>: Hello there! You’ve reached
Sizemore Motors, home of the best selection of used General Motors cars
in the Big Springs - Fair Oaks area. We can’t come to the phone right
now ’cause we’re out making a sale, so leave us a message; better yet,
come on down and steal one ’a these beauties right out from under us!
Coffee’s always on!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hi Del, it’s me. I guess you’re busy.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know you want the Oldsmobile back tonight,
so… I was wondering if I could take one of the new Buicks.</p>
<p>****: So, call me when you–</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby.
Why do you need one of the new Buicks?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, you’re there. You sound out of
breath.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: I ran back in to get the phone.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t need one, but it’s kind of a special
night, and–</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: What’s so special about it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sue Ann’s taking me out and I thought it
might be fun to go in a nice car…</p>
<p>****: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Nothing… it’s, ahh, busy here. Look, you don’t
need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I’ll see
you when I get home.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Shit! Joyce, open the damn gate, will you?!</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Uhh, no, we haven’t picked a date yet… well,
once he dumps her we will. He’s out pricing banners… I don’t expect him
back.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “Banners?”</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: You know, flags and shit… he said “for a
livelier look” or something.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, I was just… How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Great. Good. Content…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh. How come?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: I dunno. Job satisfaction, I guess…</p>
<p>****: How’s things at the Tip Top?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: They’re fine… you miss it?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: You must be joking.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>****: So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Oh, yeah, he’s got things up and running,
alright…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: ’Kay, good. Bye, then…</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Uh-huh. Anyway, I’m thinking Easter, ’cause I
just fucking love pastels.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, Christ, what am I gonna do with you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We deserve this.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Hey, darling… oww! Sorry, got my own little
Gulf War going on here.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Did you watch it yet?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Sure did. I’ll tell you, if that man was
any better looking it’d be a crime ’a some sort…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We’re
going to the Starlite in style!</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Oh, Betty–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’ll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your
eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar…</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Honey, I’m really sorry, I was gonna call
you about tonight. Larry’s got a lodge meeting. There’s no way I can get
a sitter this fast.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No… what about your sister?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: I can’t ask her again– Nathan, stop it!
Jesse, don’t take that, hit back!– I feel terrible, hon.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: You sure? Maybe next week we could…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Uh-huh. No, we’ll do it later. ’S only a
birthday, right? I’ll have another one next year…</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Aahhh…</p>
<p>****: So what color is it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: The LeSabre!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Maroon.</p>
<p>****: I stole it.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He wasn’t going to let us use it, so I just
took it.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Oh, I wish we could just get in it and
drive, and drive, and drive!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I gotta go make dinner.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sure you don’t want any salad?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: No, I do not want any goddamn… what was all
that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out
tonight, but…</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: She’s not comfortable in a Corsica? ’S got air
and leather…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: All right, then. Actually, I’m glad you’re
going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with
real potential.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … like the water purifiers?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Or the vitamins? Or the…?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they
changed the law, and you know it!</p>
<p>****: Anyway, ’least I try shit, still got some dreams left… you’re a
goddamn waitress, what do you got?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I got you, Del…</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: … well, then you ain’t got much.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, I know.</p>
<p>****: So, who’re these clients?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Couple ’a guys in from outta town. They want to
see the new LeSabres.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Just knock it off, ’kay? Anyhow, they’re
97’s, they’re not even new.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: They’re new to us…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yeah, I guess there’s nothing like watching
those tenpins fall, huh, Del?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: That is a skill!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What the hell am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Tell me something good, Sugar.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: We’re all set. I told him my car’s in the
shop. He said he’d be happy to give me a ride home.</p>
<p>****: You’re beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Tell me something I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Thanks for pulling over, David… I can’t go
that fast without taking a breather.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sorry… it’s nice to see what this little
beauty can do, though. I guess, somehow, all that speed helps me forget
the past…</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I’m sure it does… Mmm, leather. How far do
they recline?</p>
<p>****: It must make you scared to get close to someone again.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: … you can have the best damn running backs in
the world, somebody’s still gotta block for ’em.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re a hundred percent right. They rely
on what’s-his-name’s arm too much…</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: My apologies, gentlemen. I asked my wife to
straighten this shit up before she went out.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Now, what can I get you gentlemen to drink?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Bourbon, little water, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Beer, please.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Hey… you got a fine one right here!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wesley… Your wife’s a very lovely woman.
Have I seen her before?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: If you ate at the Tip Top you did.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, yes, with the coffee…</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I like this. I like doing business in the
home. It’s cozy… Who’s birthday?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Ahh… my wife’s.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What’d you get her?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Huh? Oh, umm, a car.</p>
<p>****: So, to a successful transaction…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m sorry, Chloe.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: All right gentlemen, let’s get down to it. I
need to know if you’re for real.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: If we’re for real?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: You don’t exactly look like drug dealers.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Isn’t that the point?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Yeah, well, I don’t have time to screw around.
I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this
stuff up.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We appreciate that. But you just poured me
a drink, I’d like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Fine. You got five…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s a nice place you got here. Real
comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Are you kidding me? What’s to like?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Seems like a nice place.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: It is, if you like idiots…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: It’s a small town, man. I never should have
left Omaha. People here think</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: You better believe it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Could you give us an example?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m asking you for an example of one of
these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: I don’t follow…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I didn’t think so. So, give me an example
of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you’re
equipped to recognize it.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Are we gonna do business here, or not?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Relax, we brought the cash.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m just curious. Can’t you give me an
example?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: All right … lemme see … okay, new Burger King
opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it’s some
five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hmmmm. “Five Stars,” huh?</p>
<p>****: Is that stupid, Wesley?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No, that’s ignorant. They just don’t know
any better.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s what I thought. You better give me
another example.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: This is bullshit, can we get down to business
here, please?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: He’s waiting…</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Okay, uh… the, umm, Injuns’re stupid.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: “Injuns?”</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You did not just say “Injuns,” Del.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They’re always
drunk and doing stupid things.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Driving their cars into trees… puking on the
sidewalk… stupid shit!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Let’s see… around here that would be Kiowa,
Kickapoo or Osage, if I’m not mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: I… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, my idea of stupid is very different
from yours.</p>
<p>****: So here’s how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks
off, please?</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: My socks?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You heard the man.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m gonna talk to you and when I’m
finished, you can answer. But I don’t like being interrupted. Now roll
them into a ball…</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: Oh, Jesus, please… Please, God.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … and put them in your mouth.</p>
<p>****: You’re wonderful, Chloe, you are… But I just know there’s
something special out there for me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Now I’m gonna tell you what stupid is.
Stupid is taking something that doesn’t belong to you. Right Wesley?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Stupid is trying to sell it to other people
who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: That is so right.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who
are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and
trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Now, that’s really stupid.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So you see, we have totally different ideas
of what’s stupid and what’s not. Don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Hell of a way to die.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It wasn’t always fatal, Wesley. We could
scalp Del right now, and he’d be plenty alive to tell us how it
feels.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s pretty simple, too.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: A mark, huh?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Now. I want to know the particulars of your
stupid act: how you got what doesn’t belong to you, who helped you get
it, and of course, where it is now.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: It’s in the Buick! I swear to God it’s all
there!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You wanted to see me, Blake?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: I wish I could say I had good news. David,
I’ll get right to the point. Chloe Jensen has filed charges of
sexual</p>
<p>****: You can continue to practice at L.A. County, but I’m afraid I
have to revoke your privileges here at Loma Vista until this is
resolved.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: I got it from a truck driver named Duane
Cooley, out of Amarillo. He brings my cars down from Detroit. But I
haven’t touched it, I swear to you… Please! Please! Please!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Consider yourself lucky. Luckier than those
‘Injuns’ you have such contempt for.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Are you out of your mind? You scalped
him!</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You told me how to do it!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That was to get him to talk!</p>
<p>****: Get rid of that thing, will you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This is great - just great! Now we don’t
know where the goddamn stuff is.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: He told us it’s in the Buick.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We don’t know which Buick, do we?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Well, why’d you shoot him?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I had to shoot him! It was the only decent
thing to do.</p>
<p>****: Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday to you! Happy Birthday,
dear–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: … you’re wonderful, Chloe, you are… But I
just know there’s something special out there for me.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Hang on there, Roy. Nobody comes in.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Elden called me. He wants to, ahh, make a
statement for the paper…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Hey, Betty. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m great, good, content. What happened to
your arm, Roy?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, nothing, it’s fine. I just need to keep it
wrapped for a few…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Make sure it’s elevated…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You want me to make you a sling? It’s no
problem…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to
make sure you were alright… and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask
you about what happened…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, that… Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was
disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: My God… did you get a look at who did it?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You did? Was it anyone that you…?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It was Chloe…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Hey, you guys wanna try not stepping
directly in the evidence, please? Ostrey, you and your goddamn police
scanner! I leave for ten minutes and… Betty, I’m sorry about this.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: ’Night, guys…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Okay, let’s go… I got nothing for the
record yet.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oww! My arm, careful!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Ahh, what’d you do now… fall off your bike
again?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: No, it’s nothing, I… my piranha just mauled me
a little when I layed their food out.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Good God…they’re meat eaters, Roy, just
drop the shit in there!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I can’t…they prefer a more formal presentation.
I don’t usually go so close to the surface, but I was…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: …you are so goddamn weird.</p>
<p>****: Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: No, Elden, I need to…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: You need to get yourself gone from my crime
scene. And leave Betty alone, she’s…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it
was a woman.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: It wasn’t a woman.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your
killer’s name is Chloe…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: I’m tellin’ you it wasn’t no woman,
Roy!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: You think a woman did that?!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Kinda’ looks like a burnt out roman candle,
don’t he?</p>
<p>****: Del must’ve sold a lemon to the wrong Indian, and got paid back
the old fashioned way. Them Kickapoos get pretty mean when they
drink…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: So, you think you’re gonna find his scalp
hanging in some tepee?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College
Graduate.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Did you send anyone out there?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way
to the reservation right now.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Bad idea …</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: You just go write your little story, Roy.
I’ll handle the police work…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You better handle what’s in this garbage can
first.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I still don’t understand how you knew Del
was telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face
with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act
rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts.</p>
<p>****: Never abandon you instincts.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I didn’t. You gave me a look!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What ‘look’?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: That one look you got! I thought you were
done, so I took him out…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I wasn’t done, I was just sick of hearing
him whine. And you didn’t take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I
almost puked, did I tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Well, why’d you have to tell that Indian
story?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What the hell does that mean? If I’d told a
Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You just gonna leave these cars sitting here
like this?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Why not, it’ll confuse ’em… gotta do
something, now that you fucked it up.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I wanted to make a statement.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Let me tell you something. In our business
you can’t put food on the table if your phone doesn’t ring. The guys who
get the calls are good - not flashy, just good. They get in, they get
out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three
in the head and you know they’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … that’s a good motto.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Fine, I’ll get you a bumpersticker, but you
better start believing it! It’s the only statement you need to make.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: And did your husband know these people?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sort of…but he ignored them.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: And how did that make you feel, Betty?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I felt all cold inside. And angry.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: I questioned Joyce about all this…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Seems she was pretty familiar with ’ol Del.
On a regular basis, if you get my drift…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: … and half the other guys in this town.
Including you, I believe…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Junior year!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Anyway, so what?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: So? … Suppose Betty found out about
them?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You said a woman couldn’t have done it.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: A woman can write a check.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: So you’re saying Betty Sizemore - our Betty
Sizemore–who you were in swing choir with–has now hired somebody to
scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You’re
amazing.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: ’S just a theory…just ’cause I’m thinking
it don’t mean I like it.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: She’s in a kind of shock. I see all the
signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative
symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Could I have that in American?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: It’s a type of altered state…it allows a
traumatized person to continue functioning.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: So she did witness it?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, you’re sharp as a tack, Elden.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: That’s it! YOU’RE GONE!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oww, the arm, the arm!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: You just don’t know when to quit, Roy! You
were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you’re
still jealous now!!!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: One question, Doctor, please! You can’t do
this! I’m the press, I have rights!!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: That’s right, you have the right to remain
silent.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I was saying that it seems probable that she
witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the
time being. I also think you ought to have her</p>
<p>****: Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: No… Friends from the diner maybe?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, you should find out. She keeps talking
about them…</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Let me know if you need anything, okay?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Are you and Larry happy?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Oh, I dunno… enough, I s’pose.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Then you should treasure that… you gotta hold
on to whatever you got that’s any good, even if it’s only a little
bit.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: All you been through… I ever tell you what
a good friend you are?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: All the time…</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Well, you are.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Something bad happened to Del and me, didn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some
sleep, everything’s gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sue Ann, I’m sorry about all this, but I just
know there’s something special out there for me…</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: Dear Del:</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: And now we return to “A Reason to Love.”</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: So you got Asian women?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Sure, I got Asian. Got black, white, any
color you like, video and magazine. Got fat chicks and animals too, if
you want ’em. They’re extra…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running
into you, Duane. I thought I was</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I like ’em small. When you’re inside a
little Asian chick, it’s like your dick is the axle that holds her body
together.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: That’s nicely put. You outta get yourself to
Thailand…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Georgia. In case I didn’t tell you, it’s cash
only, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: We can live with that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Here’s Ghengis Kunt and The Demilitarized
Zone. Get it? They’re Korean, so they’re pretty hot.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You know, it’s interesting. The South lost
the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson
Davis - they’re all losers in my book.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: The fuck you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: He goin’ crazy on us, or what?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Did you know the most brutal, inhumane
prison of the entire war was in Georgia?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Really. And where was that, old man?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Andersonville.</p>
<p>****: They did horrible things to men there…</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: I think you better tell me what’s going on
here, Chloe.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I just feel… funny about what we did.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: You feel guilty? Let me remind you of
something, sweetheart. You’re in this up to those fabulous eyes of
yours. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … So, at a rest stop outside Logansport you
noticed that two guys were slipping something extra in one of your cars,
and you decided to see what it was. Then you figured you’d take this
valuable commodity and go into business yourself, even though it didn’t
belong to you. But you needed a crackerjack salesman to move it, so you
made the biggest mistake of your short life and chose Del. Sound right
so far?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p>****: Now, the one thing I don’t get is that we checked all the
Buicks on that lot. Four ’97 LeSabres and nothing in ’em.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ohhh … There weren’t four, were there?</p>
<p>****: So, what happened to the fifth car?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You know you’re going to die, don’t you,
Duane? And you really don’t know where that other LeSabre is, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Should I kill him now?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wait. Any last words, General Lee?</p>
<p><strong>duane</strong>: Suck my dick, you Yankee piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: God, I admire that. Ya see that, Wesley?
That’s why they get all the glory.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: …why’d you spit on me?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Come on, Wesley, three shots.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Well, no one ever spit in my face before.
Especially some cracker fuck.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You have to rise above it. The
professionals rise above that kind of thing…</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: … small town of Fair Oaks … has left
people shaken … owner-manager of Sizemore Motors …</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: … police are still investigating.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: Sheriff, it’s Betty Sizemore, on two!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: SHHH!… BETTY? WHERE ARE</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m in a motel. Has something happened to
Del? Did he do something stupid?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Who witnessed Ms. Sizemore driving
here?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: The Assistant Manager, Mr. Wylie.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: But he couldn’t identify the male
passenger?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Only to say he was wearing green.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What if the killers didn’t see her? You
published her picture - you’re gonna get her killed!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: No, we’re bringing the community into the
effort to find her.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You’re lying!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday. That’s
right. There’s no doubt in my mind, folks… she’s on the run. Whether or
not she’s mixed up in all this remains to be seen…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s bullshit, Sheriff! You think she’s a
suspect!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: I’d like to apologize for our local boy.
He’s been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y’see. He means
well, but he’s in over his head on this.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: So how do we know that car’s still in Fair
Oaks?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We don’t. But a ’97 Le Sabre’ll be easy to
find if it’s here, town this size…</p>
<p>****: He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?</p>
<p>****: How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just
watching you…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I can eat because I know we didn’t kidnap
that woman. I can eat because they aren’t looking for us. And I can eat
’cause I’m fucking hungry… … relax. She’s gonna end up on a milk carton
and that’s about it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I hope you’re right…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … I know I am. Let’s just do what we gotta
do here, and get the fuck gone.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She got out of town awfully fast. And
wasn’t she quiet in that house? I think most women would have screamed,
don’t you? I know they would’ve…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Mrs. Rogers? I’m Dwight Campbell, with
Neighborly Life Insurance. I’m looking for Betty Sizemore.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: I wish I could help you, but I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Aren’t they precious?</p>
<p>****: Ma’am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from
the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the
area?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: No.</p>
<p>****: Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that’s it…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I see. And are you in touch with
Mrs. Sizemore?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: No. But I’m taping her show every day so
she can watch it when she comes back.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Her show?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: “A Reason to Love.”</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I see.</p>
<p>****: Did Chloe testify?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: I don’t think she will. She’s a slut, but I
just don’t think she’s that mean. Jasmine’ll bring her around…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Jasmine… Do you have yesterday’s show on
tape, by any chance?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … and how long did she work here?</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: Oh, five years, give or take.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hmm… you two in high school together?</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: Aren’t you a sweetheart… no, not quite.
Anyway, she’s been with us awhile.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: But she wanted more out of life, right?</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: No… she just wanted something outta life.
Anything. And with Del, she wasn’t getting nothing. That’s her husband,
Del. I’m sorry about what happened and all, but that’s the way I feel
about all of this…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I see. May I?</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: If it helps bring her back, be my
guest…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p>****: Just one more thing… did she ever talk about getting rich?</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: … who doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … and what kind of car does she drive?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Well, she wanted a LeSabre, but Del made her
use that blue Corsica…</p>
<p>****: So, is this what you boys’d call ‘pumping me for
information?’</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Did you say LeSabre?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Look, she didn’t kill Del over no car if
that’s what you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But she could have taken one, right?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Maybe, but I don’t think she had the nerve. I
know her. And I’m a pretty good judge of character…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … yeah, I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Would you mind very much if I changed the
channel at three o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Please? It’s very important to me. “A Reason
to Love” comes on at three around here.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That’s real funny. Why don’t you have another
drink?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’s the matter here?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I begged him to let me put that on!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: He’s a prick. Merle?… You’re a prick.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: So you’re into “Reason,” too? Finally,
someone civilized! I’m Ellen, what can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hi, I’m Betty. I’ll take a Miller, if you got
it…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’s that bitch up to now?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Lonnie? It’s Chloe. We need to talk … I don’t
think I can go through with this.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Do you have a phone?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: If it’s long distance you can leave me a buck
when you’re done.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sue Ann? It’s Betty. I just wanted to let you
know I’m okay … Huh? I’m at the Canyon Ranch Bar in …</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: Phoenix…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Shut up, Merle… Williams.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Halfway where? You’ve gotta come home.
We’ve been worried sick about you. Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would
back me up on this, you know what Del’s like. How did he take my
note?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by
from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you’ve got money comin’ to you from
Del’s policy.</p>
<p>****: Del’s life insurance policy– Are you with me?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Tell Del I’m sorry. I left so quick, but I
need to do this.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Betty! Listen to me! Del is …</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: How you holding up, amigo?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I just wish I knew why she’s doing it.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Yeah. Women are an unsolved mystery.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: If that little weasel ever walked in here I
wouldn’t serve him.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’d slap his face.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I’d kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had
any.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Where you headed, Betty?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Los Angeles, California.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: And you called your friend, and she’s telling
you not to go? When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Europe? The Europe? This is my first time out
of Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I should call you Dorothy.</p>
<p>****: When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me
not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in
“Roman Holiday,” and goddamnit, I went.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Did you love it?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Sure I loved it! It was great.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Let me tell you something. I got groped by
these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was
hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum
disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: That’s horrible!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than
Merle… I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best
thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me.
I’ve been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and
had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can
ever take that away from me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I left my husband two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m getting back with my ex-fianc. He
proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a
sentimental stop…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Wait, I thought you said you’d never been
outta Kansas…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh. I mean, except for that.</p>
<p>****: Yep. I’m trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so
that’s pretty good…</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Nice move. Cedars Sinai?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No. Loma Vista.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I s’pose his name’s David Ravell.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What’s his real name?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Dr. David Ravell.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You mean… George McCord, the actor?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, I mean David Ravell. He’s a surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yeah, I know, we just watched him together,
remember? Up there on the TV. Good God Almighty … You’re serious. I’ve
heard about people like you.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Piss off, Merle. So how you gonna find him,
Betty?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’ll go to the Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What if you can’t find him? What if you get
out there, and nothing’s the way you thought it was gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Like Rome?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Worse.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You made out alright.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be
there when I arrived…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Ellen, this is the biggest thing I’ve ever
done, but I’ve gotta do it.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: You take care of yourself then, Betty, and
don’t let anybody stop you…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: To tell you the truth, I can’t believe I’ve
made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there’s
something special out there for me…</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: What planet is she from?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So she gets rid of the asshole and is set
for life in the same day.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You think so? Joyce says she’s timid.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Joyce was screwing Del.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … among others.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’d say that about torches her credibility,
wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Yeah, well, if the wife’s trying to sell it
she’ll fuck up. She’s an amateur, just like Del was.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Maybe… Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Sorry, you’ve got the wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type.
Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: A ‘Finn?’ What is a Finn?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You should read more. Listen to me. I think
this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her.
She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she
sees her opportunity, and BOOM! - she leaves that little mudpatch in the
dust. These heartlanders can’t figure it out, ’cause that’s not their
sweet little Betty. Hah! We’ve been tracking her for, what, three days
and I already understand her better’n most the people in that shitty
little burg.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: So what the fuck’s a Finn?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind
of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut
their momma’s throat and go dancing the same night.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Like… us?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No,… like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like
a very worthy adversary.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: What the hell do you want?… Hey, Sue Ann,
what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: We think we know where Betty is.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Ah, shit… Do I have to hear this now?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: What’s with the tupperware, Elden, did
Meredith run outta baggies?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: No reason to get a plate dirty.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I see you’re sticking to the diet Betty put you
on…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Worry about your own goddamn lunch!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Tell him what you told me.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Betty is a big, big fan of the soap opera,
“A Reason to Love.” Look…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you
to…?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Listen! I saw ‘Chloe’ and ‘Lonnie’ on T.V.
They’re television characters.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Betty’s in love with Dr. David Ravell, from
the show. What if she’s out in Los Angeles looking for him? The actor, I
mean…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever
heard.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from
Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: She said she was in Arizona, did she?</p>
<p><strong>roy &amp; sue ann</strong>: Yes!!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: You people are even more stupid than I
thought. The woman’s on the run and she’s gonna just phone in her
location?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Come on, Elden, she’s not on the run.
Couldn’t you at least call the Los Angeles Police Department?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You gotta do that much.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Hey, I’m the law. I don’t gotta do
nothing…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: This is Betty at twelve.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Very graceful. Perfect form.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Betty was a lovely child.</p>
<p><strong>jerrold</strong>: And she always had such spirit! But, after
her mother died…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Would you say she was ambitious?</p>
<p><strong>jerrold</strong>: Oh, there’s no tellin’ what that girl
could’ve accomplished, and she never had it easy. Never really had a
childhood… caring for her father, going to school.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wise beyond her years, I’m sure, and such
poise, too. Very, very impressive…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Well, then, did you ever get any indication
that she wanted to leave her husband?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I don’t like talking bad about the dead,
but now that he’s gone I can tell you she put up with things in that
marriage I wouldn’t have. And yes, she, of all people, was the one who
defended him. And that’s why what that sheriff said makes me so
angry.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: If anyone had paid to have that husband
of hers killed, it would have been me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now,
without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del
Sizemore.</p>
<p><strong>jerrold</strong>: You’ve got to be missing a piece of your
soul to kill someone. That’s not our Betty…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … why do you think you have to be missing a
piece of your soul to kill somebody?</p>
<p><strong>jerrold</strong>: Because it ain’t natural, young man.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What are you talking about? Killing’s
totally natural. It’s dying that isn’t natural…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: My partner’s still young, Mr. Blaine, and
he loves his job. He’d like to kill all the criminals himself!</p>
<p>****: Now, if Betty was running from someone, where do you think
she’d go?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: God… I still look like a waitress.</p>
<p><strong>chief nurse</strong>: Of course, I don’t know every doctor
who works here…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Dr. Ravell’s the finest surgeon on the staff.
You must know him. He’s incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He’s
being sued for sexual assault right now, but– It’s not true. He was set
up.</p>
<p><strong>chief nurse</strong>: Well, I certainly would have heard
about that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Of course, he’s only here two days a week.
He’s also on staff over at Loma Vista.</p>
<p><strong>chief nurse</strong>: … I don’t think I know that
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s in a very pretty area that gets a lot of
sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background…</p>
<p><strong>chief nurse</strong>: Really? You’ve just described all of
Southern California.</p>
<p><strong>chief nurse</strong>: Well, I’m sorry, but I can’t even
consider you without references or a resume. And frankly, I don’t know
how you could have forgotten them.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There… you rest now.</p>
<p><strong>older woman</strong>: Who… who’re you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m… I’m Nurse Betty.</p>
<p>****: Do you know Dr. David Ravell?</p>
<p><strong>why isn’t anybody helping us?!!</strong>: Hey, you little
shit! If I had a gun I’d shoot you right now!</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: Forget it! He doesn’t have a chance. Help
us over here.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Danny, it’s gonna be all right!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He has no heartbeat!</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: You’re hurting him!!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m massaging his heart. I saw it done
once.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: All right, we’re moving him inside! Give me a
hand!</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Is he gonna live?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He’s got a chance. Thanks to what that nurse
did.</p>
<p><strong>administrator</strong>: Harriet? Who is that remarkable
nurse?</p>
<p><strong>chief nurse</strong>: That’s Betty Sagamore. I hired her
today.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: May I have my key, please?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Thas’ it, thas’ it… conquer that bitch.</p>
<p>****: What time’re they coming?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s not an exact science, Wesley. He said
they’ll be here… My Houston contact has always been very reliable.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: And then we’re gonna do her right here.
Right?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re always so coarse… “Do her right
here.” Let’s just see what happens, okay? “I wish that I could find a
way; To speak my thoughts on Mother’s Day. There are no words that quite
express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I
would not fail to give her this. I’d make her glad the whole day
through; By sayin’ ‘Mother’, I love you!’ P.S. I wish I could say this
to my mother’s face, but I can’t anymore.”</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Easy, Charlie! She’s exactly who you said
you were looking for.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wait, wait a minute. We have a major
miscommunication here. This not Betty. This is not even close to
Betty…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What the fuck’re you talking about? My name’s
Betty…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Then I’m sorry… Wrong Betty.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Let’s get out of here. We got another long
drive ahead of us.</p>
<p>****: … the fuck where I do not know, but I know it’s gonna be
long.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Betty would never dress like that. She’s
not some trailer park slut!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: And she doesn’t have a sewer for a
mouth…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Okay, thank you, goodbye… Keep in touch…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … She’s got class, and poise. Lots of
poise…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Will you ease off on the ‘poise’ shit,
you’re spooking me here…</p>
<p><strong>chief nurse</strong>: What you did yesterday was reckless at
best. You are not an employee of this hospital! If that boy dies I don’t
even want to think of the lawsuit that’ll follow. Are we communicating
here?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>chief nurse</strong>: Good. I’m prepared to offer you a job.
You can help out in the pharmacy until your California certification and
references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. Is that totally
clear? Fine…</p>
<p><strong>chief nurse</strong>: You can start tomorrow. And don’t say a
word about this to anyone. Is that issue?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Umm… yes. Back home.</p>
<p><strong>chief nurse</strong>: Alright. Oh, and one more thing about
what you did yesterday… Well done.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Hey, it’s Supernurse! Betty, right?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No podremos olvidar lo que hizo ayer.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: We can’t forget what you did yesterday … How
can my family ever repay you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Tell her I was just–</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yo s que es su empleo, pero…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: She doesn’t care if it was just your job…
Danny would be dead now but for you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m not. I just drove in from Kansas.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: So why’d you come to L.A.?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I came for love. My fianc is here.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Bravo! Mi hija no hace nada para amor…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: You’re making me look bad… My mother says I
wouldn’t move across the street for love.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s something I had to do. For David.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: ‘David.’ That’s your guy. So, you staying with
him?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No… I don’t really know where he is yet. I’m
at a hotel around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Man, that is love.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Ella debe quedar contigo.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: What? Ahh, Mom says you should stay with me…
Okay, yeah, why not?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: You can go get your stuff right now. I’ll walk
you down.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, that’s not, I couldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Listen, when someone does the kind of thing
you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until
you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: You okay? This neighborhood, you get used to
it…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The one you were telling me about?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: No, this one was worse…I had to have the place
sprayed when he left. Twice… He was two guys before the last one–not
counting a little office thing in there, which I’m trusting you with,
’cause if it gets out, I’m on the street…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s lovely…I really like your aquarium.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Yeah, well, at least fish don’t use your razor
or pee on the seat…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hmmm. Sounds like you’ve had a pretty tough
go of it with men…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Oh, I dunno…but just once I wish I’d run into
a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, we don’t know where she is… I
understand… No, we’ll find her…</p>
<p>****: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What’d they say? Can we go back to
Detroit?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: They said find it. Find her, find it.
Finish the job you were paid to do.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Half.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: They paid us half. They still owe us
half…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: There it is again. That lousy attitude that
got us here in the first place. That “make a statement,” do an end zone
dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that’s
dragging this whole country down the drain.</p>
<p>****: They don’t owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Worse… you’re in Texas.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl
hadn’t gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn’t be here and I’d
be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!!
Re-ti red!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I can’t find Loma Vista Hospital…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I never heard of Loma Vista Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t believe this! You’re the second
person here who’s told me that. That’s like Ford saying they never heard
of GM!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Try another county…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Hey, Rosa…it’s Betty. How do you get to this
town called ‘Tustin?’ It’s in Orange County…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the
Five…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The Five?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Just look for the really crowded road and
follow that.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Okay…oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed
some clothes?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress
you want!</p>
<p>****: We’re still on for tonight, right?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. ’S
classy… So, how’d it go today? You find him?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Ummm…no, no. Different ‘Ravell.’</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: What are you talking about? This bar is packed
with professional people!</p>
<p>****: Everybody says if you’re going to get married, this is the spot
to meet someone… Luckily, I’m currently off men, so I’ve got the luxury
of not giving a shit.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know what you mean, I recently had some
trouble with a man, a different man…and David’s still getting over
Leslie. His wife.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: He has a wife?!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Had. She died in a car accident last year.
She was decapitated.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: God, that’s awful!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It may not have been an accident. They never
did find her head…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Her ‘head’?! You’re making this up…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair
with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy…</p>
<p>****: We’re not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I’m
making this my personal mission.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: David isn’t hiding from me, I left him
standing at the altar six years ago and now I’m…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Fuck the details, they’re always to blame…
Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they
become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I’m
just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or
whatever…</p>
<p>****: One of us should.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Rosa, I can’t believe you’re doing all this
for me…thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Hey, how ’bout a card for me? What is that?
“Please call if you have any information on David Ravell.” This is my
phone number! How many of these have you given out?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: How many men have I talked to?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Jesus! They’re all gonna be calling me!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You said in L.A., anything goes.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: I was talking about what you could wear!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: See, in a LeSabre Betty’s probably getting
twenty-two, maybe twenty-five miles to the gallon, where we’re topping
out at fifteen.</p>
<p>****: She’s probably all cool and fresh, and comfortable in that nice
air-conditioned car right now.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What the hell’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That was a really shitty thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m sick of looking at her mother-fucking
face.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t talk like that. She’s my last one,
Wesley, my final target. Don’t you realize your special, that you
represent something?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What? What does she represent?! What could
some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who’s dragging our sorry asses up
and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I’d just love to
know…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I dunno… something.</p>
<p>****: Why is she doing this to me? Why?…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I don’t know, but when we find her she’s
gonna die for it.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Can you describe her to me?… Okay… Yeah,
that sounds like her… Thanks.</p>
<p>****: Sounds like she’s with the buyer Del lined up.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How’d they describe her?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You know, blonde, thin, whatever…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Not so fast! Slower… ‘blonde, thin’, yes…
Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: How do I get this fucking thing down?</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: I wouldn’t if I were you. He got pretty
upset when I tried it…</p>
<p><strong>mercedes</strong>: What do you think my father would do if I
told him I didn’t want to be a lawyer anymore?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Probably the same thing my mom would do if I
got engaged… have a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>mercedes</strong>: So how’s it going with your new roomie?
What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Betty. It’s O.K. except I’m worn out. We spent
all weekend looking for her</p>
<p><strong>mercedes</strong>: So tell her to settle for the old one in
Orange County.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: She’s gonna have to ’cause I’m out of
ideas.</p>
<p><strong>mercedes</strong>: Maybe we’re suing him for malpractice.
What’s his name again?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: David Ravell.</p>
<p><strong>mercedes</strong>: God, that sounds so familiar. Ravell,
Ravell… where’s he out of?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: I’m not sure now. She said he used to be over
at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>mercedes</strong>: Loma Vista? You mean like the guy on “A
Reason to Love?”</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Guess who I saw today.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Doctor David Ravell.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What? Where was he?!</p>
<p><strong>on television!!</strong>: Cut the shit, will you!</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Either you’re making a fool out of me because
you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I have no idea what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Shhh! I heard you the first time.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: I spent my weekend looking for someone who
does - not - exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my
brother, but I was with you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: If you didn’t want to do it, you should have
said so! Is this about gas money?</p>
<p>****: You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and
we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor - whose name
is George, by the way. His character!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Are you having a nervous breakdown?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: I helped you because I’m an idiot! Ask my
mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!!
I</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: You need help, Betty! Even if this is your
idea of a joke, you need SERIOUS</p>
<p><strong>help!!</strong>: Necesitas un mdico! Pront simo!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: You’re wastin’ your time, Roy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not
advice, okay? This is a complex case.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Nothin’ complex about it. Del’s dead, Betty’s
gone. She’s probably dead, too.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You’d like that wouldn’t you? You’ve hated
Betty since you were in Pep Squad together…</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: No… before that.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just
make you small…</p>
<p>****: I should have never come back here after college.</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Blah - blah - blah… Hurry up, will ya, I got
a date tonight…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Names, a phone number, something…</p>
<p>****: Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing
car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything
about it? If Ballard wasn’t such a stubborn ass, I wouldn’t have to be
breaking in here…</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: The driver was killed. I think there’s a
connection–</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: No, about… Are you talking about Duane
Cooley?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yeah. Why, you know him?</p>
<p><strong>joyce</strong>: Know him? We were gonna get married! He was
gonna leave his wife for me! Fuck!!…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: I know you don’t use them, but if you wanna
keep ’em you’ll back out of there slowly…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all
them trunks standing open like that… something’s going on here!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: I know that…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, do something, then, damnit!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: You watch your mouth when you’re in a
goddamn county vehicle… You don’t think I see what’s going on? Del, now
this Cooley fella, both of ’em mixed up with Joyce… ’S not no
conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files… ’s just a crime of
passion, plain and simple. Betty’s on some kind’a pre-minstral rampage,
that’s what is going on here.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oww… Did you have to make these things so
tight?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: No, I didn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>mercedes</strong>: Hey… Is Betty still trying to find that
soap opera guy?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Oh, yeah… Man, I’d love to find that actor
just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.</p>
<p><strong>mercedes</strong>: Here’s your needle… He’s supposed to make
an appearance here tonight.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m looking… just taking a tiny
break.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: This is crazy. I come home, you go to your
room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: …okay.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Oh, it’s a charity dinner. The money goes to a
good cause, but I don’t have anybody to go with…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Umm…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: …you hungry at all?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We should go.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: We don’t have time to look at a hole in the
ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one’s got to be her.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s a very moving experience, trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the
World.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No… be dark before we get there. You wanna
see the Grand Canyon at night?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What difference does it make? She wasn’t in
Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I said, ‘No.’ N-O.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: “When I grow up I’m going to become a nurse
or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be
it animal, plant or mineral…” Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to
you?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Do you hear yourself right now…? Like a
fucking madman…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Every American should see the Grand Canyon.
Are you an American?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Yes, I am and we’re not going. Act
professional.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: If you don’t take the next turn for the
canyon, I’m blowing my goddamn brains all over this car.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Looking for someone?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: You never know who you’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Do I know you from…?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: …of course you do. You don’t remember me?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I take it I should. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: We were engaged.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Oh good, another one…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: But I’m the one who’s sorry. Letting you go
was the biggest mistake of my life. We were thirteen days away from
getting married and … I just got scared. It’s a mistake I’ve had to live
with for six years. But it’s behind me now… And I hope you can put it
behind you. I’ve missed you… David.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s very kind of you.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: The day I left you I just drove and drove. I
drove all day and all that night, and I didn’t go anywhere. I just kept
driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in,
and I sat–</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: … in the very first pew, where we would have
sat on our wedding day.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote
it?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: I’m Lyla Branch. I’m the Producer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, wait…what happened next, Betty?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Are you sure you want to encourage this?</p>
<p>****: No, you’re right, let’s have some fun. So, what did happened
next, “Betty”?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, David moved out here and started his
residency. Then he met Leslie–</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: No, no, no. We know all that. What happened
with you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I married a car salesman.</p>
<p><strong>friend #1</strong>: You were dumped for a car salesman,
George!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why are you calling him George?</p>
<p><strong>friend #2</strong>: Yeah - David - tell us about this car
salesman.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, you mean Fred.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, Del.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of
cars. He could talk anyone into anything.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You knew Del?!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Honey, I didn’t want to tell you at the
time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he
saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have
drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch
eventually, but I still owe him one.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He never told me anything about…that’s
unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Funny, that’s just what I was thinking…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I can’t tell you how much it hurts me to
hear that you married him.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m so sorry. Life makes us do awful things
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I tried to tell myself it was for the best,
that there was a reason behind it. But… Del?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There was no plan! I was just young and
stupid and scared!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You never gave us a chance…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know that. I can’t tell you how many times
I’ve said that to myself in those exact words.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hey, don’t… come on, I was just… you’re not
really crying, are you?… I was just playing along…</p>
<p><strong>friend #1</strong>: Now, look what you’ve done, George.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why do they keep calling you George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t know. Why do you keep calling me
George?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Listen - David - It’s getting late.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Right, uhh…I feel terrible about this, we
have a prior engagement at another party.</p>
<p>****: But… I’d be honored if you’d come.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Yeah, bring your friend along. I’m sure you
got a lot of catching up to do…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You don’t know what you’re missing,
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Mr. Campbell?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: It’s Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore’s
friend? I heard from her.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … you have a good time? You make a little
wish?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where? Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m not telling.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I’m not telling ’til you straighten up. You
been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit’s gotta stop or
you can forget about your Betty… I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wesley, I’m fine… just tell me where she
is.</p>
<p><strong>friend #2</strong>: I bought a car from Del, too. He sold me
a lemon.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Really? I put a hundred and thirty thousand
miles on mine.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Huh. I had no idea our little lot was so
popular…</p>
<p><strong>friend #1</strong>: I never bought a car from Del. But I
loved him. In my own way.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I guess we all did. You know, I didn’t marry
Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, David…I’m sorry I caused you that much
pain.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re late, Eric.</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: I know. Why are you guys leaving?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: We did our twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You bastard! How can you even show your face
around here? Do you think we’re not onto you?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: Who the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sorry. She thinks you’re someone else.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know exactly who you are!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This doesn’t look like the kind of place
Betty would go to.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees,
doesn’t she?!…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Be careful with that!</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: We’re Federal Marshals, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We’re looking for this young lady.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I haven’t seen her.</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: Sure you have! That’s …</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Shut up, Merle.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Ma’am, if you’ve seen this woman–</p>
<p><strong>merle</strong>: Betty! That’s her name - Betty.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: I never saw that woman before, and neither
has Merle. He drinks too much. And don’t try to tell me you’re cops.
I</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You haven’t been very forthcoming with
us.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’s your name, dear?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Ellen.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s a nice name.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: That’s a really nice name…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Lyla’s very nice.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes, she is.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: She told me I was charming and relentless,
and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other
charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s a good person to know.</p>
<p>****: So where did you study again?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters,
but Del made me give it up…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Alright, okay… I think you broke the record
for staying in character about three hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You told me that two hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What happened when you were twelve?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: For Mother’s Day, I used all my allowance
that I’d been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails
done and had lunch at “Skies,” a restaurant at the top of a building
from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took
together. She died the following year.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Wow … You just gave me goosebumps, you know
that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I just want everything to be perfect between
us.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I know. Listen, we need to take a time out
here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: At last! I know how much you want this.
You’re gifted and extremely determined, but … it’s not up to me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know. It’s up to us.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Were you with him this whole time?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, God! You scared me! Yes…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: You still in love?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Does he know you think he’s real?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: He is real.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Uh-huh… So, what’d you talk about?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here,
what we’ve both been doing, you know…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: No, I’m not sure I could begin to imagine… So,
where’d you go?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: To a party in the Hollywood Hills.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole
world?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes. I’d never been in a place like that
before.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean
them. I used to piss in their pools.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, almost never.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: But, you’re in love with someone who doesn’t
exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face,
and instead you leave with him!</p>
<p>****: Betty, you are one-of-a-kind…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is
ridiculous, I need medical attention!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: That’s a nice name for what you need…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Come on, I have to get this dressing off…it
itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Just shut up a second and listen… That, uh…
that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Any idea where it is?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Little place called “Williams,” why?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: I just got something off the wire. The
woman who owns it was murdered last night.</p>
<p>****: Now, I’m not saying I agree with you or nothing, but… what else
do you know?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I know plenty.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She makes me stretch! I got inside my
character last night like I haven’t done in six years on “Reason”. It
was a totally rejuvenating experience.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: I know, George, I was there. I’m not denying
that she’s good.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s even taken a job as a nurse!</p>
<p>****: David Ravell’s getting boring, Lyla.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: We know that…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Can I have an evil twin?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: No, George, we’ve already done that with
Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy?</p>
<p>****: Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: I don’t know, George…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ll tell the cast ahead of time. What do
you say?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’ll be like live television! Let’s live on
the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: I said I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use
her, I want to direct those episodes. She’s my discovery.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Actually, she was my discovery… just like
you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: “Would you like ground pepper on that salad,
Ms. Branch?” Remember?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: … yeah.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So you believed the bartender. Why?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Well… I think I saw her soul.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: That’s good. You’re learning. But let me
tell you why I know she was lying.</p>
<p>****: First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It’s beneath
her.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, no, Betty came here strictly for
business, ’cause it’s the biggest market for what she’s selling. I
should have known it all along. I’m kicking myself as I shave here. So,
first thing we…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Wait, wait, wait a minute… that doesn’t make
sense.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What doesn’t?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends
theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I never said that I believed…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: No, you believed her, we drove all the way
to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much… so why’s the rest of
her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: ’Cause I just don’t buy it. Call it
instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I call it ‘nutty’ as my shit after I eat
Almond Roca…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You need to remember who you’re talking
to…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I need to get my goddamn head examined.</p>
<p>****: You can’t rule something out on a whim. Or because she’s cute.
I’ve been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I’m
tired! Me!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wesley…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: “It’s beneath her…” She’s a mother fucking
housewife… nothing’s beneath her!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Boy, you need to get outta my face… now!
You got a feeling, then you do what you gotta do, but don’t you ever try
to tell me my job. Not ever.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Fine. Just fine… I’ll go check some shit on
my own then. And don’t call me ‘boy…’</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … what kinda car’s Jasmine drive?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Ahh, Mercedes, I think. Black.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Yeah? The sport utility?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Damn, that’s sweet…</p>
<p>****: She really that good-looking in person?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Better.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Oh fuck…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Betty Sizemore, she’s got ten kilos… Blonde
hair, a great figure… sort of a whole Doris Day thing going on. That’s
what I said– Doris Day. You could see her working at the U.N., or
something. ‘The U.N.’ “United Nations.” Forget it…</p>
<p>****: Nobody like that? You’re sure? Yeah, Detroit by way of Kansas…
Alright, let me know if you hear anything, okay?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Are you sure I can borrow this?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: No, please. Go ahead, it’s your funeral…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Rosa…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Well, what if this guy’s just playing with
you? What if he’s lying about who he is?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You should have a little faith in people.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Does he ever talk about medicine? His
patients, the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: All the time. It’s always “Loma Vista” this,
“Loma Vista” that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You must be Rosa. I’ve heard so much about
you… I’m George McCord.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Not as much as I’ve heard about you. She’s a
very nice girl and you better not hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Rosa, so you’ve met David?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he
introduced himself to me as George!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, he does that. It’s this silly game he
plays. Half the people who know him call him George.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t think your friend likes me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: She’s a little jealous, I think. And confused
when it comes to men…</p>
<p>****: So where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, first I thought Patina, and then the
Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my
place.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: God, I haven’t felt like this since I was
with Stella Adler in New York. You’re so…real.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You never mentioned a ‘Stella’ to me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, I would have remembered that name. The
only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.</p>
<p>****: Was this before Leslie? Before us?…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’ve never met anyone like you, Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I know, that’s why we were meant to be
together…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, I mean your dedication scares me…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s easy to be dedicated, when you care
about something…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first
started, but now… the hours, the repetition… it’s not all glamour and
mall openings anymore. Maybe I should’ve listened to my people and tried
to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don’t know…</p>
<p>****: …I just hope it’s not too late for me. God! Listen to me, “Me,
me, me.” It’s so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this
business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That’s it, no more
about me tonight, I promise… Let’s talk about you…what do you think
about me? I’m kidding… Seriously, Betty, I’m doing all the talking
here…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: …but I love listening to you, so that’s
okay…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks. But I’d like to hear what you’re
feeling…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, I just feel that life’ll be much
sweeter for you now with me around. I promise…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know, I almost believe that… you’re like
a warm breeze that’s suddenly blown into my life… I said that to Leslie,
once, at her funeral, remember?…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I remember. You said it to her, but it was
meant for me, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes… maybe it was.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: …so I’m standing there, minding my own
business on Hollywood Blvd., checking out Gladys Knight’s star-thing
there, I look up at this little souvenir shop dude, Chinese dude,
reading a paper… and who do I see? That’s Lonnie. He’s the show’s Main
Prick. And that is definitely Betty. Now, that ain’t no coincidence…</p>
<p>****: I found out where they shoot it, and where the dressing rooms
are.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: A doctor on the show… why?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It just didn’t fit her profile…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Fuck the profile! That’s the same guy!!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: She can’t be here because of a… a soap
opera. Not a soap opera. That’d make her…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain’t far
behind…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … but she’s, no, Betty’s smarter than that.
She wouldn’t be here for a…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: I do not know how the fuck you lasted an
hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our
prayers in your motherfucking jacket… a picture of that cunt right next
to the…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Don’t Don’t you talk about Betty like that.
I don’t care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got
it?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Man, you have got to get some therapy.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I said ‘got it?’</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … yeah, I got it. Come on, you’re stretching
out my vest…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You made your point… I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just a little further… come on…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh my gosh…I didn’t know I was going to meet
your friends today…I dressed a little casual.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s cute…listen, you got the part, and
I’m directing. You’ve only got four lines today, so I thought I’d just
spring it on you. No blocking or anything, just stand near the nurse’s
station… we’re gonna do a quick walk-through. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Quiet on the set!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Traffic was terrible…</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: No, that’s fine, we’ve only got seventy pages
to shoot…take your time.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Excuse me. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>stage manager</strong>: We’ll get you into hair and make-up
after this, just put this on…</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Hi. I hear you’re great. Good luck…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What are you doing here? David…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Your lines’ll are in the script, but you can
ad lib.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Ad lib?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: In fact, I want you to ad lib, that’s the
magic I’m after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Slate it!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just do what you’ve been doing. Watch the
scene and on your cue take off from there.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: 5-4-3-2…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Betty?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>blake</strong>: I think you stepped on my first line…</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: … I was talking to her. Do you need
anything…?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Betty, I thought this would be the best way.
You know, throw you into it…</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: If you need a minute, that’s okay. But I
thought you’d want to–</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: David, I don’t… Can we talk privately for a
second?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Stop calling me David. We’re on set, for
Christ’s sake, you don’t have to call me David here.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Why am I doing this to you? Isn’t this what
you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Is there a problem, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No! No problem, there is no… What is the
problem? Just do that… thing… you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with
this for three days, now do it!</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: All right, everybody! That’s ten minutes!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No! Let me try this!</p>
<p><strong>jasmine</strong>: This is bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Forget it, George. It was a gamble, it didn’t
work. Nice try.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE’S BEEN</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well, I don’t know what you had in mind, but
I hope you’re happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation,
and you’re making me look like an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: What do you mean? What did I do to you…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Who put you up to this? Did my ex-wife ask
you to…?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: David, please–</p>
<p><strong>stagehand</strong>: Leave her alone, George!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: SHUT THE FUCK UP!! You’re a fucking grip, go
grip something!!! And you’re not an actress, you’re nothing but a soap
opera groupie, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>you have nothing better to do! do you??</strong>: Well, why
don’t you get a fucking life, and stop ruining mine!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m sorry…Oh my gosh, are you George
McCord?!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: …What? What did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: George…McCord. You’re my favorite actor
on…</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: She called you ‘George,’ George.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: …did I win some contest?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: But I’m David… I mean, I’m not David, but
she thinks I am! You heard her… Stop staring at me… I’m not crazy, she
is!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am
I… why am I here? I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You’re doing this now? After all the.. are
you sick? Are you going to kill me now?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, I… I’ll leave. Forgive me if I caused you
all any trouble… I just, I don’t know how I… … I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What can I do for you, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: How do you do, Mr. McCord. We’re trying to
locate a deranged fan of yours,… a Ms. Betty…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Deranged. That would be the right word.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Thanks so much. You must get bothered by
this kind of thing a lot.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: More than you know. Is there anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, that should be more than–</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Actually, there is one more thing.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You thought wrong.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: It’s just for an autograph. It’s not for
me…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It never is.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You need to learn some manners, friend…
reach out to your goddamn fan base a little more.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I came for love…</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: You’re not on that soap opera thing again, are
you? ’Cause you know what that is?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s people with no lives watching other
people’s fake lives.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: That’s right. So, if you know it, why are you
in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>del</strong>: You sure don’t. Who do you think you are coming
to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who
you really are.</p>
<p>****: Goddamn, it’s hot!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Who are you talking to? Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Bet-ty!? Did the pizza guy show up yet?</p>
<p>****: He dumped you, didn’t he? I KNEW IT WHEN I MET HIM!! He’s a
loser, like the rest of them. Mother-fucker!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m going back to… I need to… I don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I have to leave now.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: What? No, I’m not gonna let you just run out
of here… You need to talk about what’s going on…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: You think I’m crazy, Rosa, but you don’t know
the half of it. My husband was, ahh…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Your husband?!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two
weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Jesus!… What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t know. I’m just starting to remember
it now. I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Yeah, but your running away isn’t going to
help you with all this…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I
think I watched the whole thing happen… Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Okay, okay, look, ummm… Let’s just talk a
little first and you’ll feel better, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Whoa! What the fuck’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, you were right about what that
bartender said.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: But you were right first. You gotta follow
your instincts.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What do your instincts tell you to do now,
kid?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and
get the rest of our money.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We could do that. I could be on my way to
Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: …but that’s not what we’re gonna do, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No… if we don’t finish this job, how are we
gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she’s
the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if
there’s one thing I’ve tried to teach you here–</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: It’s to follow my instincts. And my
instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, I said to follow ‘my’ instincts. Now,
we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … oh, that’s fucking democratic.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m Detective Jefferson–</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Oh… Did Betty call you?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: She’s got problems, but she’s no killer. I
hope you guys can straighten this out…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We’ll do what we can. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Bet-ty! Please, go easy on her. She’s had a
really rough day.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p>****: Rosa, I didn’t kill Del… they did.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: We meet again.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: That’s our pizza.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Get rid of them. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Roy! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You’re in serious danger!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Ahh, look, right now’s not very…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I woulda’ been here sooner, but Ballard put me
in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: I never said that! Open the door,
Betty.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Sheriff, I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: C’mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions
for you about…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Have you checked the trunk of that car you’re
driving, Betty? I think there might be…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: It’s not really a good time, guys…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Don’t give me that. I’ve come two thousand
miles for this!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Two thousand miles? That’s nothing!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This is Roy Ostrey, he’s a reporter. And this
is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, this is wonderful…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: I got two kids and a dog…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Act professional, remember?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … I s’pose you did that so I could take my
sweater off or something.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, just stand there… lemme look at you a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … I… I know what you are.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Do you know why I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’ve got a pretty good idea. You’re here to
kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I’m not. I don’t care
who you are, or why you two killed my husband…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You really… didn’t have anything to do with
what Del was doing, did you?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I have no idea what he was mixed up in… it
was always something.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So you weren’t involved with him in his
pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs,
Betty?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Drugs? God, no! I’m totally against
drugs.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Damn, life is strange. I had you figured
for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch– Not that I didn’t admire you
for it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … well, if you’re not going to slit my
throat, why’d you come up here?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … to see you.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: You killed that bartender in Arizona and
the trucker in Texas, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: How did you find Betty?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: I just put it all together. I knew David,
Lonnie and Chloe were from that show.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What do you want?!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s a lie! I figured it out! I’ve been
trying to tell this dumbass–</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: –small-time, pissant, Barney Fife–</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you,
before I kill you!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I’m the one who watched the show…I was…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Did Chloe crack?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Totally. She came apart like a house of cards.
They dropped the charges…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: Goddamn… how ’bout Jasmine?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: She’s a lesbian.</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: You lie, motherfucker…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I swear to God!</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: What?! You scream, you die.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: I have a tape of today’s show.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: … I never meet people like you. I’m a
garbageman of the human conditon. I deal with trash, mostly, people
willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their
rotten lives. But you… you’re different.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I am?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Sure. You could probably have any thing you
wanted… somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don’t
even realize it.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Umm, I don’t think that…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wait. Let me get this out. I like the
symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read
passionately, and I like to discuss things. I’m basically conservative,
but flexible. I’ve been involved in the death of thirty-two people, but
I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty-two pieces
of shit, excuse my language.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: “Thirty-two?”</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, thirty-three, but I’m not counting
Del, on account of you… so, what do you think?</p>
<p>****: You probably feel I’m flattering myself to see us together.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t feel that, no. I just….I’m not really
who you think I am.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No one is, honey. Here, listen to this… “If
who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be
friends.” Now that’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I wrote that when I was twelve… where’d you
get that?!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I know. I borrowed it from your
grandparents because I… I… it doesn’t matter. Don’t worry, they’re fine…
Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words,
sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea…</p>
<p>****: I’ve chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find
out we’re a lot more alike than you’d think.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I thought you were a garbageman of humanity,
or something.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Yes, but I’d sort of like to put that
behind me now…</p>
<p><strong>wesley</strong>: … goddamn!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wesley??!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Those’re Japanese koi!</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Yes! How’d you know that?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You gotta get ’em in water right away!</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: We’re in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the
damn fish!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: YOU shut up! They’re beautiful, but get them
some water.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, Christ, they shot my boy!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You’re sorry? YOU’RE THE REASON WE’RE</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: We need ammo… Go check his jacket, I’ll
cover you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I’m not going out there! Let’s wait for the
real police…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: You gotta go, we’re pinned down!</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: So why can’t we just sneak outside? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Lady, you don’t just run away from crime…
besides, Betty’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead.
I say we wait…</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: No, no, no… you don’t know shit about
procedure! You don’t send your best…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I’ve got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted
all your bullets so you crawl out there.</p>
<p><strong>ballard</strong>: Goddammit…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: If we went out that window right now we’d
have a chance…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I better go check on them.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wait, Betty… you still haven’t answered
me.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This is really awkward…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Ahh, it’s too late, anyway. It’s too
late.</p>
<p>****: Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with
me… If you’d gimme my gun back.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I’d rather not…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Betty, I don’t wanna shrivel up alone in
some stinking prison. No way. I’ve got some professional pride. And I
don’t want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: …what’re you saying?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: When a Roman general knew a battle was
lost, he’d throw himself on his sword.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Yes… Not the actor, though, the doctor. I
think.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So all this…really was because of that soap
opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor?
A fake doctor?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I wouldn’t have put it quite that way,
but…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Wesley didn’t even want to come up here. He
warned me, but I insisted…</p>
<p>****: I have to ask you, Betty…are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: I don’t think I am.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I want you to listen to me, Betty. People
don’t lie when they’re about to die.</p>
<p>****: You don’t need that doctor. You don’t need that actor. You
don’t need any man. It’s not the forties, honey. You don’t need anybody.
You’ve got yourself… and that’s more than most people can say.</p>
<p><strong>anchorman</strong>: In a story that police say is bizarre,
even for Hollywood, a father-son team of killers tracked a Kansas soap
opera fan halfway across the country, only to find themselves the
victims in a final, bloody confrontation…</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: This story is beyond belief, which is perfect
for us. It’s free advertising and it’s gonna run for months.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I don’t think she can do it. You saw what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: You fucked it up. Who wouldn’t freeze in those
circumstances? And I don’t care what her problems are. She wouldn’t be
the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by
making her an offer.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What about me? Don’t you wanna know how I
feel about it? I’m the one who…</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I
got news for you. I loved your ‘icy water’ idea the other day… I’m
toying</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: That’s not a bad idea. How many episodes
before he comes back?</p>
<p><strong>lyla</strong>: Then do as you’re told. Get her back.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m sorry for what I did. It was
inexcusable. I’m sorry for the things I said, and for not respecting
you, and for all the stupid things that…</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: When you have a minute…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Look, I don’t really like the whole idea of
autographs, and I’m kind of in the middle of…</p>
<p><strong>darlene</strong>: Don’t flatter yourself. It’s the check.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh. Of course… sorry.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: My treat. You were saying… something about
how stupid you’ve been?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Right… I was. I was an idiot, plain and
simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Kinda like you’d been saying it since you got
on the plane…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I have… did it sound that bad?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you,
Mr. McCord…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: George…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … George. I do.</p>
<p>****: My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be
a crime…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … it’s too bad you’re such an asshole. ’S the
only thing that Del was ever right about.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: No, that’s… okay. Fair enough.</p>
<p>****: So, now that we’ve sort of settled the ‘asshole’ thing, is
there any chance you’ll come back to the show? At all?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: … there’s always a chance, David.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Right. But will there be a tomorrow, and the
next day, and the next?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Doctor, if you were any handsomer it’d be a
crime…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I guess that means you’re free tonight. Of
course, it’s up to you…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: No, it’s up to us. I love you, David. And I
want to see you tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day…</p>
<p><strong>sue ann</strong>: That’s my best friend!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Could I get some service here, please?</p>
