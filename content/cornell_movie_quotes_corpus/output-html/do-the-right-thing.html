<p><strong>cee</strong>: In a big way.</p>
<p><strong>ahmad</strong>: My people. My people.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Where’s the Bud? Where’s the Bud?</p>
<p><strong>korean clerk</strong>: No mo’ Bud. You look what we have and
buy.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: No more Bud. What kind of joint is this?
How come no mo’ Bud? Doctor, this ain’t Korea, China, or wherever you
come from. Get some Budweiser in this motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>korean clerk</strong>: You buy ’nother beer.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Alright. Alright. Y’know you’re asking a
lot to make a man change his beer, that’s asking a lot, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: You ole drunk. What did I tell ya
about drinking in front of my stoop? Move on, you’re blocking my
view.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: You ugly enough. Don’t stare at
me.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: The evil eye doesn’t work on me.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Mother Sister, you’ve been talkin’ ’bout
me the last eighteen years. What have I ever done to you?</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: You’re a drunk fool.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Besides that. Da Mayor don’t bother
nobody. Nobody don’t bother Da Mayor but you. Da Mayor just mind his
business. I love everybody. I even love you.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: Hold your tongue. You don’t have that
much love.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: One day you’ll be nice to me. We might
both be dead and buried, but you’ll be nice. At least civil.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Hector, I shouldn’t be telling you this but
you would find out sooner or later. Ya father ain’t no real father. He’s
a bum, a two-bit bum in a hundred-dollar world. Your father is to the
curb. You’re smart. I see that look on ya face. You’re saying if he’s
such a bum why am I with him? Good question. Like I said before, you’re
no dummy. He talked his way into my panties, I thought being a mother
would make me happy, make me whole. He’s a mistake, but you are not.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: The way I see it, if this hot weather continues,
it will surely melt the polar caps and the whole wide world–the parts
that ain’t water already–will be flooded.</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: You a dumb-ass simple motherfucker.
Where did you read that?</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: Don’t worry about it. But when it happens and
I’m in my boat and ya black ass is drowning, don’t ask me to throw you a
lifesaver either.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: Fool, you’re thirty cents away
from a quarter. How you gonna get a boat?</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: You’re raggedy as a roach. You
eat the holes out of donuts.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: I’ll be back on my feet. Soon enough.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: So when is all this ice suppose
to melt?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You paying now or on layaway?</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You come in here at least three times a day.
You a retard? A buck fifty.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Damn, Sal, put some more cheese on that
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Extra cheese is two dollars. Y’know dat.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Two dollars! Forget it!</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Mookie.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: How come you ain’t got no brothers
up?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Ask Sal.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Sal, how come you ain’t got no brothers
up on the wall here?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You want brothers up on the Wall of Fame, you
open up your own business, then you can do what you wanna do. My
pizzeria, Italian Americans up on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Take it easy, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Don’t start on me today.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Sal, that might be fine, you own this,
but rarely do I see any Italian Americans eating in here. All I’ve ever
seen is Black folks. So since we spend much money here, we do have some
say.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You a troublemaker?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: You making trouble.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Put some brothers up on this Wall of
Fame. We want Malcolm X, Angela Davis, Michael Jordan tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Don’t come back, either.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Boycott Sal’s. Boycott Sal’s.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Buggin’ Out, I gotta work here.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: I’m cool. I’m cool.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Come back in a week, it will be
squashed.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Mookie, if your friends can’t behave, they’re
not welcome.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I got no say over people.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: You talk to ’em.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: People are free to do what they wanna
do.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I know, this is America, but I don’t want no
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Mookie.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: C’mere, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Doctor, this is Da Mayor talkin’.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Doctor, always try to do the right
thing.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>nilda</strong>: I hope it’s not cold.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: No, it’s not cold. Twelve dollars for the
pie.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Hold it. Let me count this first.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: You’re short.</p>
<p><strong>nilda</strong>: I counted the twelve dollars myself.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Twelve is right, but no tip.</p>
<p><strong>nilda</strong>: No tip.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Look, lady. I carried your pizza up five
flights of stairs and shit. The cheese didn’t slide over to one side
like it sometimes does with delivery people who don’t care. I do care.
May I get paid?</p>
<p><strong>nilda</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Gracias mucho.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: A dollar! Cheap bastard! Your pizza is gonna
be fucked next time.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: Jade, you’re late.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I know, Mother Sister, but I’m here now.
Where’s the stuff?</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: Seen your brother, just walked
by.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: This might take some time.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: I got nowhere to go. We haven’t had a
good sit-down for a long while.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: Tender-headed runs in my family. You
tender-headed?</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Yeah, me too.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: That’s why I don’t fool with it. Only
let you touch it…Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Sorry, comb got caught.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: Be gentle, child. Mother Sister is an
old woman.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: How are you holding up in this weather?</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: I’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I don’t know why you still haven’t bought an
air conditioner.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: Don’t like ’em. A fan will do.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: I didn’t know you had such beautiful
hair.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: Fool, there’s a lot in this world you
don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: I’m not stopping. I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn’t
right.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: I’m not studying no Mayor. Besides,
he reminds me of my least favorite peoples. My tenants and my ex-
husband–Goddamn-bless his soul.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: Number One: I got some jive, late-
rent-paying trifling Negroes in this house. Every year I keep
threatening to sell it.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: And move to Long Island…</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: And move to Long Island. Number Two:
my ex-husband lost all my property, all my money in his scheme to build
a Black business empire. Needless to say what happened, this house is
it, all I got. I’m too through with yar people.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Whew!</p>
<p><strong>ella</strong>: Ahmad! Put me down! Put me down! I can’t get
wet! I’m not playing!</p>
<p><strong>ahmad</strong>: Yo!</p>
<p><strong>ella</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m not playing. There’s gonna be trouble
if you fuck around.</p>
<p><strong>punchy</strong>: Go ’head. You got it. You got it.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This is an expensive car.</p>
<p><strong>cee</strong>: You won’t get wet.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m warning you.</p>
<p><strong>punchy</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>cee</strong>: Hurry up. We ain’t got all day.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I’m fucking soaked. If I ever catch those
fucks they’ll be sorry. Cocksucking sonabitches!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You people make me sick.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Officers, I want an arrest made. Now.</p>
<p><strong>officer ponte</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Two Black kids soaked me and my car. It’s
fucking ruined.</p>
<p><strong>officer long</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where are they? What kind of fucking
asshole question is that? They ran the fuck away.</p>
<p><strong>officer ponte</strong>: Do you wish to file a complaint?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: A complaint. I want those fucks locked
under the jail.</p>
<p><strong>officer ponte</strong>: This hydrant better not come back on
or there’s gonna be hell to pay.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What about my car? I want justice.</p>
<p><strong>officer long</strong>: You know anything about this?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He knows. He’s a witness. They all know. He
saw the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>officer long</strong>: Who were the punks?</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Those who’ll tell don’t know. Those who
know won’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>officer ponte</strong>: A wise guy.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Let’s go, Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>officer long</strong>: Keep this hydrant off. You want to
swim, go to Coney Island.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: He’s leaving? What about me?</p>
<p><strong>officer ponte</strong>: I suggest you get in your car quick,
before these people start to strip it clean.</p>
<p><strong>officer long</strong>: Let’s go, break it up. Go back to your
jobs.</p>
<p><strong>officer ponte</strong>: What jobs?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Mookie, what took you so long? I got a business
to run.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Run it then.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Here, this goes to the radio station.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Pop, I’m gonna go with Mookie.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Good, make sure he don’t jerk around.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Yeah, hurry back, it’s getting crowded.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Mister Se�or Love Daddy is cool.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Ya like him, huh?</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Y’know, Vito, I know Pino is ya brother and
shit, but the next time he hits ya, the next time he touches ya, you
should “house him.” Kick his ass.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: If you don’t make a stand, he’s gonna be
beating ya like a egg for the rest of your life.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: That’s what you think?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: That’s what I think.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: I don’t like to fight.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Do it this one time and he’ll never touch
you again.</p>
<p><strong>mister se�or love daddy</strong>: Peoples, my stomach’s been
grumbling but help has arrived. My main man Mookie has saved the day,
straight from Sal’s Famous Pizzeria, down the block. Come up to the
mike, Mookie.</p>
<p><strong>mister se�or love daddy</strong>: C’mon, don’t be shy. Mmm,
smells good. This is ya Love Daddy talkin’ to ya, starvin’ like Marvin.

<p><strong>mookie</strong>: No, you the man.</p>

you can say, “Excuse me?”</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: I’ll fuck you up quick two times.</p>

Who told you to walk on my side of the block? Who told you to be in my
neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: I own a brownstone on this block.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Who told you to buy a brownstone on my
block, in my neighborhood on my side of the street?</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: What do you want to live in a Black
neighborhood for? Motherfuck gentrification.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: I’m under the assumption that this is a
free country and one can live where he pleases.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: A free country?</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: I should fuck you up just for that
stupid shit alone.</p>
<p><strong>ahmad</strong>: Your Jordans are dogged.</p>
<p><strong>cee</strong>: You might as well throw ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>punchy</strong>: They looked good before he messed them
up.</p>
<p><strong>ella</strong>: You used to be so fine.</p>
<p><strong>ahmad</strong>: How much did you pay for them?</p>
<p><strong>cee</strong>: A hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>ahmad</strong>: A hundred bucks!</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: You’re lucky the Black man has a loving
heart. Next time you see me coming, cross the street quick.</p>
<p><strong>ahmad</strong>: He’s dissing you.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Damn, my brand-new Jordans. You should
buy me another pair.</p>
<p><strong>clifton</strong>: I’m gonna leave now.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: If I wasn’t a righteous Black man you’d
be in serious trouble.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Move back to Connecticut.</p>

Mook.</p>

<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Smack him back.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Remember what I said.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Are you gonna listen to this Mook? Listen to
him tell you to smack me? Your only brother?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>officer ponte</strong>: What a waste.</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: As I was saying before we were so
rudely interrupted by the finest.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: What was you saying?</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: Motherfucker wasn’t saying
shit.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: Look at what?</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: It’s a fucking shame.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: Sweet Dick Willie.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: That’s my name.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: Do I have to spell it out?</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: Make it plain.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: OK, but listen up. I’m gonna break it down.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: Let it be broke.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: Can ya dig it?</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: It’s dug.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: Look at those Korean motherfuckers across the
street. I betcha they haven’t been a year off da motherfucking boat
before they opened up their own place.</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: It’s been about a year.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: A motherfucking year off the motherfucking boat
and got a good business in our neighborhood occupying a building that
had been boarded up for longer than I care to remember and I’ve been
here a long time.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: It has been a long time.</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: Too long! Too long. Now for the life of me, I
haven’t been able to figger this out. Either dem Koreans are geniuses or
we Blacks are dumb.</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: It’s gotta be cuz we’re Black. No other
explanation, nobody don’t want the Black man to be about shit.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: Old excuse.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: I’ll be one happy fool to see us have our own
business right here. Yes, sir. I’d be the first in line to spend the
little money I got.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: It’s Miller time. Let me go give
these Koreans s’more business.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: It’s a motherfucking shame.</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: Ain’t that a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Sonny! Sonny!</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Doctor, what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Eddie Lovell.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Ten.</p>

<p><strong>eddie</strong>: My name is Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: What makes Sammy run?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I said my name is Eddie Lovell.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Relax, Eddie, I want you to go to the
corner store. How much will it cost me?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How would I know how much it’s gonna cost if
I don’t know what I’m buying?</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Eddie, you’re too smart for your own
britches. Listen to me. How much do you want to run to the store for Da

<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fifty cents.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: You got a deal.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Git me a quart of beer, Budweiser, say

<p><strong>ahmad</strong>: Who told him he was Da Mayor of this
block?</p>
<p><strong>cee</strong>: He’s self-appointed.</p>
<p><strong>ella</strong>: Leave him alone.</p>
<p><strong>punchy</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Go on now. Leave me be.</p>
<p><strong>ahmad</strong>: You walk up and down this block like you own
it.</p>
<p><strong>cee</strong>: Da Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>punchy</strong>: You’re old.</p>
<p><strong>ahmad</strong>: A old drunk bum.</p>
<p><strong>ahmad</strong>: What do you have to say?</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: What do you know ’bout me? Y’all can’t
even pee straight. What do you know? Until you have stood in the doorway
and heard the hunger of your five children, unable to do a damn thing
about it, you don’t know shit. You don’t know my pain, you don’t know
me. Don’t call me a bum, don’t call me a drunk, you don’t know me, and
it’s disrespectful. I know your parents raised you better.</p>
<p><strong>ella</strong>: He told you off.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I know I haven’t seen you in four days. I’m
a working man.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I work too, but I still make time.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Tina, what do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I want you to spend some time with me. I want
you to try and make this relationship work. If not, I’d rather not be
bothered.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Alright. Alright. I’ll be over there
sometime today.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Before I get off work.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Bring some ice cream, I’m burning up. Do you
love me?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Do I love you?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Mookie, get offa da phone.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Be off in a second. Tina, I dedicated a
record on Mister Se�or Love Daddy’s show to you.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Big deal.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Mookie! How is anybody gonna call in?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Big deal? If that’s not LOVE, I don’t know
what is.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: You deaf or what?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Gotta go. See ya soon. Everybody happy
now?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Sal’s Famous Pizzeria, yeah, two large pizzas,
pepperoni and anchovies, hold on… See, Pop, Mookie fucking talking on
the phone and people are trying to call in orders. He’s making us lose
business.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Mookie, you’re fucking up.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Twenty minutes. How come you niggers are so
stupid?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: If ya see a nigger here, kick his ass.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Fuck you and stay off the phone.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Forget it, Mookie.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Who’s your favorite basketball player?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Magic Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: And not Larry Bird? Who’s your favorite
movie star?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Eddie Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Last question: Who’s your favorite rock
star?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Barry Manilow?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Pino, no joke. C’mon, answer.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: It’s Prince. He’s a Prince freak.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Shut up. The Boss! Bruuucce!!!!</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Sounds funny to me. As much as you say
nigger this and nigger that, all your favorite people are “niggers.”</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: It’s different. Magic, Eddie, Prince are not
niggers, I mean, are not Black. I mean, they’re Black but not really
Black. They’re more than Black. It’s different.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Pino, I think secretly that you wish you
were Black. That’s what I think. Vito, what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Y’know, I’ve been listening and reading ’bout
Farrakhan, ya didn’t know that, did you?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I didn’t know you could read.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Fuck you. Anyway, Minister Farrakhan always
talks about the so-called “day” when the Black man will rise. “We will
one day rule the earth as we did in our glorious past.” You really
believe that shit?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: It’s e-vit-able.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Keep dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Fuck you, fuck pizza, and fuck Frank
Sinatra, too.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Well, fuck you, too, and fuck Michael
Jordan.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Dago, wop, garlic-breath, guinea,
pizza-slinging, spaghetti-bending, Vic Damone, Perry Como, Luciano
Pavarotti, Sole Mio, nonsinging motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: You gold-teeth, gold-chain-wearing,
fried-chicken-and-biscuit-eatin’, monkey, ape, baboon, big thigh,
fast-running, three-hundred-sixty- degree-basketball-dunking spade
Moulan Yan.</p>
<p><strong>stevie</strong>: You slant-eyed, me-no-speak- American, own
every fruit and vegetable stand in New York, Reverend Moon, Summer
Olympics ’88, Korean kick-boxing bastard.</p>
<p><strong>officer long</strong>: Goya bean-eating, fifteen in a car,
thirty in an apartment, pointed shoes, red-wearing, Menudo, meda- meda
Puerto Rican cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>korean clerk</strong>: It’s cheap, I got a good price for
you, Mayor Koch, “How I’m doing,” chocolate-egg-cream-drinking, bagel
and lox, B’nai B’rith asshole.</p>
<p><strong>mister se�or love daddy</strong>: Yo! Hold up! Time out! Time
out! Y’all take a chill. Ya need to cool that shit out… and that’s the
truth, Ruth.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Sal, can you do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Depends.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Can you pay me now?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Can’t do.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Sal, just this once, do me that solid.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You know you don’t get paid till we close
tonight. We’re still open.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I would like to get paid now.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Tonight, when we close.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Whaddup. Money?</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: I was going to buy a slice.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’ll be back after I make this delivery.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: On the rebound.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: That’s the dope.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: I just copped them. Let me tell you
the story of Right-Hand–Left- Hand–the tale of Good and Evil.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: It was with this hand that Brother
Cain iced his brother. LOVE!</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: See these fingers, they lead straight
to the soul of man. The right hand. The hand of LOVE!</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: The story of Life is this…</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: STATIC! One hand is always fighting
the other. Left Hand Hate is kicking much ass and it looks like Right
Hand Love is finished. Hold up. Stop the presses! Love is coming back,
yes, it’s Love. Love has won. Left Hand Hate KO’ed by Love.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: Brother, Mookie, if I love you I love
you, but if I hate you…</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: I love you, my brother.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I love you, Black.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: Two slices.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: No service till you turn dat shit off.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: Two slices.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Turn it off.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Mister Radio Raheem, I can’t even hear myself
think. You are disturbing me and you are disturbing my customers.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: Two slices, extra cheese.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: When you come in Sal’s Famous Pizzeria, no
music. No rap, no music. Capisce? Understand?… This is a place of
business. Extra cheese is two dollars.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Jade.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I’m in here.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: How come you’re not at Sal’s?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’m working.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Is this another one of your patented two-hour
lunches?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I just come home to take a quick shower.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Sal’s gonna be mad.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Later for Sal. Y’know, sometimes I think
you’re more concerned with him than me.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I think no such a thing. Sal pays you, you
should work.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Slavery days are over. My name ain’t Kunta
Kinte. Sis, I don’t want to argue, stop pressing me.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I just don’t want you to lose the one job
you’ve been able to keep, that’s all. I’m carrying you as it is.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Don’t worry ’bout me. I always get paid.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Yeah, then ya should take better care of your
responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: What responsibilities?</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I didn’t stutter. Take care of your
responsibilities. Y’know exactly what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I’m beat.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Pop, I think we should sell this place, get
outta here while we’re still ahead…and alive.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Since when do you know what’s best for us?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Couldn’t we sell this and open up a new one in
our own neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Too many pizzerias already there.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Then we could try something else.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: We don’t know nuthin’ else.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: I’m sick of niggers, it’s a bad neighborhood.
I don’t like being around them, they’re animals.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Some are OK.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: My friends laugh at me all the time, laugh
right in my face, tell me go feed the Moulies.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Do your friends put money in your pocket? Pay
your rent? Food on ya plate?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Pop, what else can I say? I don’t wanna be
here, they don’t want us here. We should stay in our own neighborhood,
stay in Bensonhurst.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: So what if this is a Black neighborhood, so
what if we’re a minority. I’ve never had no trouble with dese people,
don’t want none either, so don’t start none. This is America. Sal’s
Famous Pizzeria is here for good. You think you know it all? Well, you
don’t. I’m your father, you better remember that.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Hurry up and get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I’m going with you.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Da Mayor, we need your leadership.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Doctor, what are you talkin’ bout?</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: I’m organizing a boycott of Sal’s
Famous Pizzeria.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Keep walkin’, Doctor. I don’t want to hear
none of your foolishness.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: Hell no! Goddamnit. Sal ain’t
never done me no harm. You either.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Would you like to sign a petition to
boycott Sal’s Famous Pizzeria.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: I’ll do it without your help.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Sal, we’re gonna boycott ya fat
ass.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: It’s so nice to see a family hanging
out together.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: We’re not hanging out. I’m being escorted
back to work.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: That’s not even true. I just want a slice.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Jade, you don’t know this, but I’m
organizing a boycott of Sal’s Famous Pizzeria.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: What did he do this time?</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Y’know all those pictures he has
hanging on the Wall of Fame?</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Have you noticed something about
them?</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Yo, I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I’ll see ya there.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Peace.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Every single one of those pictures is
somebody Italian.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: And I–we–want some Black people up.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Did you ask Sal?</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Yeah, I asked him. I don’t want nobody
in there, nobody spending good money in Sal’s. He should get no mo’
money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that
motherfucking wall.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Buggin’ Out, I don’t mean to be disrespectful,
but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: So, in other words, you are not
down.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I’m down, but for a worthwhile cause.</p>
<p><strong>buggin’ out</strong>: Jade, I still love you.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I still love you too.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Mookie, you are pushing it. You’re really
pushing it. I’m not paying you good money to fucking jerk me around.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You’re gonna be in the street with the rest of
your homeboys.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: ’Bout time, Pop.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Jade, we’ve been wondering when ya would pay us
a visit.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Hi, Sal, Pino, Vito.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: What’s happening, Jade?</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Nuthin’ really. How are you treating my
brother?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: The Mook? Great. Mookie’s a good kid.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Pop, stop lying.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Shaddup! Jade, what can I fix you?</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: What’s good?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Everything, but for you I’m gonna make up
something special. Take a seat. There, that’s a clean table.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: You still letting Pino push you around?</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Who told you that? He doesn’t push me, who
told you, Mookie tell you that? I hold my own.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Forget about it, Vito. Forget I even brought
it up.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Pino picks on me, but I don’t let him push me
around. Mookie tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Alright already.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: Twenty “D” Duracells.</p>
<p><strong>korean clerk</strong>: Twenty “C” Duracells.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: D, not C.</p>
<p><strong>korean clerk</strong>: C Duracell.</p>
<p><strong>radio raheem</strong>: D! D! D! You dumb motherfucker. Learn
how to speak English first. D.</p>
<p><strong>korean clerk</strong>: How many you say?</p>

You’re alright. Just gimme my twenty Duracells, please.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: I’d thought you might like these… I guess
not.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Ain’t nuthin’ like the smell of fresh
flowers. Don’t you agree, Miss Mother Sister?</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Summertime, all ya can smell is the
garbage. Stink overpowers everything, especially soft sweet smells like
flowers.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: If you don’t mind, I’m gonna set right
here, catch a breeze or two, then be on my way.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Thank the Lord, the sun is going down,
it’s hot as blazes. Yes Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: What can you say?</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: I don’t know how he does it.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: ML, hold this for me.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: That’s OK. At least my moms didn’t name me Sweet
Dick Willie.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: Why you gotta talk ’bout my
moms?</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: Nobody talkin’ ’bout ya moms.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: I didn’t say nobody, I said

<p><strong>ml</strong>: Sweet Dick, I didn’t mean it like that.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: Yes you did.</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: Squash it.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: I just wanted to know who named ya Sweet Dick
Willie?</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: It’s just a name.</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: And what does ML stand for?</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: ML stands for ML. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: Naw, that’s some stupid shit. Now
you know how I got that name.</p>
<p><strong>ml</strong>: Negroes kill me, always holdin’ onto, talkin’
’bout their dicks.</p>
<p><strong>coconut sid</strong>: I don’t know ’bout you, but it’s too
hot to fuck.</p>
<p><strong>sweet dick willie</strong>: Never too hot, never too cold for
fucking.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Ice cream. Ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Doctor, you know better to run out in the
street… Stop crying, son.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Doctor, there’s nothing to cry about.
You’re OK.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Mayor knocked me down.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: You should be ashamed of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Ma’am, the boy is just scared to death.
What actually happened is that I was minding my business when I saw your
son about to be run over. I ran into the street to save him and I had to
knock him down to keep the both of us from getting hit.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Eddie, is that the truth?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Eddie, you hear me talkin’ to you?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I’m talkin’ to you, boy.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: Miss, the boy is fine.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What I tell you ’bout lying?</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: What did I tell you ’bout playing in the
street?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Mommy! Mommy! I’m sorry. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: Get upstairs now.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: And when your father comes home, he’s gonna
wear ya little narrow behind out too.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: You didn’t have to hit your son; he’s
scared to death as it was.</p>
<p><strong>louise</strong>: I appreciate ya helping my Eddie. I truly
do, but I’ll have nobody question how I raise him, not even his
Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Sal, that was delicious.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’ll see you out.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: See ya around.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Don’t wait too long to come back.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Jade, I don’t want you coming in here no
mo’.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Stop tripping.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: No, you’re tripping. Don’t come in Sal’s.
Alright, read my lips.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: What are you so worked up about?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Over Sal, the way he talks and the way he
looks at you.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: He’s just being nice.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Nice!</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: He’s completely innocent.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Innocent!</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I didn’t stutter. You heard me.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: You should see the way he looks at you. All
Sal wants to do is hide the salami.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: You are too crude.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I might be, but you’re not welcome here.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Stop trying to play big brother. I’m a grown
woman. You gotta lotta nerve. Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and
you’re gonna tell me what to do. Come off it.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: One has nuthin’ to do with the other.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: Oh, it doesn’t, huh! You got your little 250
dollars a week plus tips…</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’m getting paid…</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: …peanuts.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Pretty soon I’ll be making a move.</p>
<p><strong>jade</strong>: I truly hope so. I’m tired of supporting a
grown man.</p>
<p><strong>mister se�or love daddy</strong>: As the evening slowly falls
upon us living here in Brooklyn, New York, this is ya Love Daddy rappin’
to you. Right now we’re gonna open up the Love Lines. Hello, you’re on
Love Daddy’s Love Line. No names, please. Let’s keep it anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>female voice #1</strong>: Hi, Mister Se�or Love Daddy. I’d
kiss your feet every morning, that’s how much I love you.</p>
<p><strong>mister se�or love daddy</strong>: How nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>female voice #2</strong>: I think you have the sexiest voice
in the world. All you have to do is talk.</p>
<p><strong>mister se�or love daddy</strong>: Love Line, you’re on.</p>
<p><strong>female voice #3</strong>: You give me fever.</p>
<p><strong>mister se�or love daddy</strong>: She’s feeling it.</p>
<p><strong>female voice #4</strong>: Love Daddy, I’d work in Mickey D’s
24, 7, and 365 just to call you my own. Give you all my money,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>mister se�or love daddy</strong>: That was the last call for
tonight on Mister Se�or Love Daddy’s Love Line. I love you. You I
love.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: Mister Mayor, I saw what you did.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: That was a foolish act, but it was
brave. That chile owes you his life.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: I wasn’t trying to be a hero. I saw what
was about to happen and I reacted, didn’t even think. If I did, I might
not have done it in second thought. Da Mayor is an old man, haven’t run
that fast in years.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: I went from first to home on a bunt
single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August
1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama. Maybe I should be heroic more often.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: Maybe you shouldn’t. Don’t get happy.
This changes nothing between you and me. You did a good thing and Mother
Sister wanted to thank you for it.</p>
<p><strong>da mayor</strong>: I thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mother sister</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Sal, I don’t care if you fire me this exact
minute, leave my sister alone.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Mookie, I don’t know what you’re talking about,
plus I don’t want to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade
alone.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Here, you gotta delivery.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Is this the right name and address?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Yeah, do you know ’em?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: No, just checking.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Delivery from Sal’s Famous Pizzeria.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What took you so long? Is it hot?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Hot. Hot.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Come in then.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Tina, you are too slick.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: How else was I going to get you here? I
haven’t seen you in a week.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’ve been working hard, getting paid.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Where’s the ice cream? The H�agen- Dazs butter
pecan?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Shit! I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Your memory is really getting bad.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I just forgot.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: And I really wanted some ice cream too.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I can run out and get it.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: No! No! You won’t come back either.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I can’t be staying long anyway.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: How long then?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Long enough for us to do the nasty.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: That’s out. No! It’s too hot! You think I’m
gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and
never see you again in who knows when?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: A quickie is good every once in a blue
moon.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: You a blue-moon fool.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Then we’ll do something else.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Trust you? Because of trusting you we have a
son. Remember your son?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’m gonna take off ya clothes.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Mookie, I told you already it’s too fucking
hot to make love.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Why you gotta curse?</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: I’m sorry, but no rawness is jumping off
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: No rawness.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Tina, you’re sweating.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Of course I’m sweating. I’m burning up. It’s
hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Lie down, please.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Rampolla.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: It’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: It’s ’pose to be cold.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Later for you.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Meda. Meda.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Tina, you don’t have a forehead, you got a
eight-head.</p>
<p><strong>mister se�or love daddy</strong>: Yes, children, this is the
Cool Out Corner. We’re slowing it down for all the lovers in the house.
I’ll be giving you all the help you need, musically, that is.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Thank God for thighs.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Thank God for buttocks.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Thank God for the right nipple… Thank God
for the left nipple…</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Feels good.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Yes, yes, Lord. Isn’t this better than
Haagen-Dazs butter pecan ice cream?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’ll be back tonight.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: It’s almost ready.</p>
<p><strong>officer long</strong>: What time you closing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>officer ponte</strong>: What do we owe you?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Nine-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>officer ponte</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Thanks. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>officer long</strong>: Vito, Pino, see ya later.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: Sal, if you want me to deliver any faster,
get me a jet rocket or something, cuz I can’t run with pizzas, all the
cheese ends up on one side and shit.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I didn’t say nuthin’. You must have a guilty
conscience. What are you guilty of?</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: I’m not guilty of nuthin’.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You must be guilty of something or you would
have never come in saying the things you said.</p>
<p><strong>mookie</strong>: C’mon, Sal.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Where we goin’?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Vito, I want you to listen to me. I’m your
brother. I may smack you around once in awhile, boss you around, but I’m
still your brother.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: I know this.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: I’m listening.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Good. I want you to listen.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Jesus Christ on the cross, I said I’m
listening.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Good. Vito, you trust that Mook too much. So
does Pop.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Mookie’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: You listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: Stop busting my balls. I said I’m listening
ten fucking times already.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Mookie is not to be trusted. No Moulan Yan can
be trusted. The first time you turn your back, boom, a knife right here.
In the back.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: How do you know this?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: I know so. He, them, they’re not to be
trusted.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: So what do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Be on guard. Mookie has Pop conned already, so
we have to look out for him.</p>
<p><strong>vito</strong>: I like Mookie a lot.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: And that’s exactly what I’m talkin’ ’bout.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Vito! Pino! Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>pino</strong>: Be right there, Pop. Listen to what I
