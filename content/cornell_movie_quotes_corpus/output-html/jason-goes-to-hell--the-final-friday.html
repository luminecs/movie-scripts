<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Eat me, you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent abernathy</strong>: Incoming!</p>
<p><strong>abernathy</strong>: Good job, Agent Marcus.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>abernathy</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, please… please…</p>
<p><strong>abernathy</strong>: It is my pleasure to announce that Jason
Voorhees is finally and irrevocably…dead.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent 1</strong>: Okay, sir.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: We have a large male caucasian…age
unknown…</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: No indication of cirrhosis.</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: The heart is nearly twice the size of a
normal heart. Malformed…</p>
<p><strong>coroner</strong>: It appears to be filled with a black,
viscous fluid…frankly, I don’t know what the hell it is. It’s not
blood.</p>
<p><strong>fbi man 1</strong>: I.D.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: You just saw me come out of there.</p>
<p><strong>fbi man 1</strong>: I.D. please.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Hey, what’s the matter.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: You ate already? I was only gone ten
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Yes. That’s a probe.</p>
<p><strong>fbi man 1</strong>: So that’s the verdict – is Jason gonna be
getting up and walking around any time soon?</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Tonight, on American Casefile…</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Jason Voorhees – dead…or deadly?</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: These dramatic photos were taken in the
aftermath of the autopsy of Jason Voorhees, mere hours after his death
at the hands of Federal Forces. The facts: Two security men – dead. A
Coroner – dead. Another Coroner – missing. Are these men victims of a
serial killer only believed to be deceased? Many say yes.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I’m Robert Campbell. Tonight, on American
Casefile, we’ll talk, via satellite, to Mr. Creighton Duke – the bounty
hunter responsible for the capture of six of this country’s most reviled
serial killers/</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Mr. Duke, how can you claim that Jason
Voorhees is not truly dead?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: How many times has Jason been reported killed
before, Mr. Campbell?</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Eight times.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Eight times. They’ve burned him, dipped him in
nuclear waste –</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: – But this time they bombed him and then
cremated the body.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: They coulda danced a jig on it an’ fed it to
goats – don’t matter. Ya’ can’t kill Jason by gettin’ rid of his body.
He’ll come back the way he always do, to drag the kiddies into the
darkness and crush their little skulls – maybe even your skull,
Mr. Campbell.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Well, let’s hope not!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yeah, that’d be a big shame…</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: In the media, you’ve frequently been
described as “salty” –</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: – look, just shut up. Let’s cut through the
shit. You asked me here because you want me to catch and kill Jason
Voorhees for ya’. I’ll do it, but it won’t be easy…and it won’t be
cheap. One hundred grand, non- negotiable.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I understand. However, our audience should
be aware that you only charged forty thousand dollars to catch the Idaho
skin stretcher.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Skin stretcher was human.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Let’s get one thing straight, Mr. Campbell.
This isn’t your garden variety serial killer – there’s only one way to
put and end ta’ put an’ end to Jason Voorhees for all time and I’m the
only one that knows the way. If you want him dead truly dead – my fee is
one hundred grand. You know where to find me.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Mr. Duke tonight I’m prepared to offer you
your sum of one hundred thousand dollars, payable only after you provide
American Casefile with incontrovertible proof of –</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: – yeah, yeah, yeah. You just have your hundred
grand ready. For that you get the machete…the mask…the whole damn
thing.</p>
<p><strong>joey b.</strong>: Hey! Lady Di!</p>
<p><strong>joey b.</strong>: I’m sorry to cut into your TV time, but
there’s a few customers out here who’d like to eat sometime this fuckin’
month.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: This is truly sick.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>joey b.</strong>: No, this is not sick, Diana, this is
business. People are gonna come to see Jason’s hometown and they’re
gonna come with appetites.</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Di – food’s up!</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Thanks, Shelby.</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: Ma – you seriously want me to cut these like
this?</p>
<p><strong>joey b.</strong>: Yes I do!</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: They look stupid…</p>
<p><strong>joey b.</strong>: Well, that’s your dumbass fault – they’re
supposed to look like hockey masks! Now watch.</p>
<p><strong>joey b.</strong>: This makes a whole new patty…hence the 2
for 1 burger sale.</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: My God, I love this woman.</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: You guys make me sick.</p>
<p><strong>shelby</strong>: Table 3, Di.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Diana – you heard from Jessica lately?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Allright, you’re gettin’ somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Burger, side of fries. Double burger, side of
rings. Meatloaf, side of me.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Where the hell was that on the menu? I’d have
ordered a couple.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You keep movin’ in on my woman and I might
have to take you out back and shoot you.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah, I’ve seen you shoot…</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I don’t know… …I think you two should just go
ahead and get married.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I’m sorry, son, I’m going’ a little deaf in
my old age…what did you say again?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I said I think I’ll just eat my food over by
Steven and shut the hell up.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: That’s exactly what I thought he said.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Everything going okay?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: It’s going.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Legs giving you trouble?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Not so bad, today.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Steven buggin’ you?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Do you have to ask?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Jesus, he’s relentless.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Let me talk to him, Diana. I just need
three minutes with him.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Ed…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Okay. So how is Jessica? You talked to her
lately?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Yeah, she’s good, considering. That kid just
takes everything in stride.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Wonder where she got that from…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I gotta get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Okay, I’ll call you later.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Don’t say it…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: How about this – I’ll make you a deal…I’ll
marry Diana when you quit banging Edna and concentrate on your wife.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Poor, lonely Diana…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: What can I get ya’?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ll take a Voorhees burger and a side of Jason
Fingers.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Creighton Duke.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I’m kind of busy right now…</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’m going to kill Jason Voorhees – and I need
you to help me.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Jason Voorhees is dead.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You know he’s not…and he’s coming for you.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: You food’ll be right out.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I’ll give you ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: No, I –</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Twenty.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Look –</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Thirty. Name your price. Everyone has a price,
what’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Look, I don’t want your money!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Then maybe I should offer it to your
daughter…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You know what I want. You know why I need
you.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: You need to leave.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I know everything about you, Diana.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: That’s it, we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I know who you really are!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What’s the problem here?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: N…nothing.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: I was just making your girlfriend there a
little proposition…she’s thinking it over. Right, luv?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Maybe you should be moving on.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Maybe you should mind your own business.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Get up!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Why don’t you blow me, Chief. After your
girlfriend gets through.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You’re talking about my lady.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: She’s your lady only cause she ain’t had a
taste of the Duke yet.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Careful, Chief. I don’t think you know who I
am.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I know who you are and the last thing we
need around here is some freak show “bounty hunter” making trouble. I
want you outta town and I want you outta town now!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s very colorful, chief.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Take him to my car. I’ll be out in a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: He’s comin’ for you, Diana…and your daughter.
Lock your doors.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I’m sorry if he upset you…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I don’t need you to fight my battle. I don’t
need any part-time protection.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: He seem to think Jason’s… …comin’ fer
ya’?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Steven, I need to talk to you. There’s
something you don’t know about Jessica, something you should know. She
was going to tell you herself but…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: …but there just may not be enough time. If
you still care about her, if you still want to try to make things better
between you two…we should talk.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So let’s talk.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: No. Not here. Come by my house tonight at
eleven. Don’t be late.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Sorry, Di. I was just going to my car. I
didn’t mean to frighten you…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: It’s…It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Listen…don’t you worry about Ed. He’ll come
around. He’s too good a Sheriff to let you give him the slip.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I’m just too old for going steady, Josh.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: So’s he and he knows it.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Everything’ll work out. Trust me on that.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Good night, beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: ’Night, Josh.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Not here.</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: Sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Bill didn’t go bowling at the regular
time?</p>
<p><strong>edna</strong>: The League changed the damn time…but we’ve
still got ’til ten- thirty. Hop in.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What do you mean you’ve never made a prank
call?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You mean never as in really never, or never
as in it was just so stupid you don’t want to tell us about it?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I mean really never.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that. A famous man once
said – there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Jesus, Steven, that’s…that’s really
lovely.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I mean, how can you go through life without
never having made a prank call?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like,
having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: That’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Disgusting? Bingo night was sold out for six
months after that! They raised enough money to build a day care
center.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: It was a community service.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Absolutely. The church even sent me an
autographed picture of God. Ward!</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You ever make a prank call?</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: I called an adoption agency once when I was
like nine or something and I told them I wanted to trade my mom in for a
box of Lincoln Logs.</p>
<p><strong>joey b.</strong>: Why don’t you shut the fuck up and cook
those burgers?!</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: I really wanted those fuckin’ Logs.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Showing Vicki what she missed out on by
being such a dull kid. Now, the first thing you need in making a prank
call is, of course, a phone. This one, for instance.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Steven, c’mon, we’re not thirteen…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Next, you dial a number.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Really, Steven, I don’t want you to do
this…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: …and it’s now ringing…ringing… and – Hello?
Anthony’s Pizzeria? Yeah, this is officer Randy Parker over at the
station.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Oh, c’mon, would you stop, please?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Is this Anthony?…Yeah, well, I just have one
question for you, Anthony – did you fuck my dog?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Oh my God, Steven.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah, well somebody fucked her and if I find
out it was you, I’m gonna come over there and shoot you in the head.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I’m now begging you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Listen, since I got you on the phone – ask
the guys there if they wanna chip in for a hooker. I’ll send her right
over. Her name is Vicki.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Steven!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: She’s a waitress at Joey B’s but she needs
some extra cash. Ward’s the pimp.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: I’m literally going to kill you!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Ten dollars! Hell, I can’t do that to you –
you can have her for a pizza.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: A pizza?!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Randy, what the fuck? Take these off!</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: Food’s ready. Tell the guys at the station the
pimp says hi.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Sure thing. See ya’, Steven.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Randy, you dipshit! Take these off!</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Sorry, I’m working now. You see, I have a
job…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Randy, c’mon!</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Have a good night.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Ah, shit.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Wanna know how I did that?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Gotta go. See you guys later.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: By the way, if you’d been paying attention
you’d have noticed I held the receiver down when I dialed – cop like you
should be more observant than that.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: He drives me so fucking crazy.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Coming! Hold on!</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: June the 19th.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Ed…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: That’s when my vacation starts. If we get
married then, we’ll have two weeks in Hawaii. I love you, Diana. I’m
sorry I’ve waited this long. Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: God, Ed, I love you too, I…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Josh! What are you doing!</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Oh God…Oh Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: You saw him? You know who he is?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: You have to…save…Jessica… Save Jessica and
save the…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Save your…</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Steven…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I’m scared. I’m very scared.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Oh, God Almighty, no…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It was Josh. He fell outside. He –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Oh, my dear God…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: He was dead. He had to be dead…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No… you can’t think I…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: How many times do you want to hear this?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Until I hear the truth.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ve told you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: The truth? That Josh, a man I’ve trusted
with my own life on more than one occasion – let me see if I’ve got the
order right here – tried to rape Diana…got the back of his head blown
off…took a poker through the gut…fell through a plate glass window and
then magically disappeared into the night.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know what it sounds like.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You don’t know shit!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I didn’t kill her!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Then why were you at her house?! She didn’t
want anything to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: She asked me to come over. She said she had
something to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: About Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: That’s a lie. Diana would never talk to you
about Jessica. Not after what you did to her.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Look, I know I treated her bad –</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: – Bad?!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You call what you did bad?! You knocked her
up and then left her!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No – she left me! After her miscarriage, I
–</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: – Miscarriage?! Who the fuck told you
Jessica had a miscarriage?!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: She did!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: My God…you are one sorry son-of-a-
bitch.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: She did have a miscarriage, didn’t she?
Didn’t she?!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: If I wasn’t the Sheriff here, if I thought
I could get away with it… I would kill you right now. That’s no
exaggeration. I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Do you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I don’t believe that you murdered Diana. I
don’t know what really happened, but I know you couldn’t have done
it.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: You just sit tight – I’m gonna take care of
this. I’ll straighten everything out.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Jesus, Randy… …what is Jessica gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Jessica, I’m so sorry. I…I wanted to have
this cleaned up before you got here.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: That’s all right. I was just…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh, God, Vick…</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: A girl?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: She’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Her name’s Stephanie.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: She’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: She has Steven’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I was going to, I was going to tell
everyone. I just…didn’t expect to be back here so soon. Is Steven
around?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Does he know about what happened?</p>
<p><strong>vicki</strong>: Yeah. Sit down a second. There’s something I
need to tell you about Steven…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I’m sorry. I have to bring you to a cell.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Are you crazy?!</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I know, I know, I’m sorry but the Sheriff is
just berserk right now. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Hopefully we won’t have to hold you more than
a day. I’m gonna bust my ass to prove you innocent but you gotta be cool
or Landis will really kil you, okay? Okay?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: …Jessica…</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: My God…</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I’ll be back later. You just be cool,
okay.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: Don’t do anything stupid.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What am I gonna do – I’m locked up in a
friggin’ cell?!</p>
<p><strong>randy</strong>: I’m gonna get your outta this. Just hang
tight. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Ed…I’d like you to meet my boyfriend,
Robert Campbell.</p>
<p><strong>landis</strong>: Ed Landis.</p>
<p><strong>landis</strong>: I’ve seen your show. I like it about as much
as I like anything on the television.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>landis</strong>: I hope you’re not down here on business. I
wouldn’t take kindly to seeing Diana’s face on one of your programs.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: No, sir. I’m just here for Jess…</p>
<p><strong>landis</strong>: He’s a cute little fella.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He’s a she.</p>
<p><strong>landis</strong>: And as pretty as her mamma…and her mamma
before that…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>officer dill</strong>: Sheriff, we, uh, we have a problem
with Diana Kimble’s body…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Bring him here. I wanna talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Ah, the funeral home just has a couple
questions. Wait here, I’ll be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Where the fuck is she, Duke?!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: That’s what I’d like to know.</p>
<p><strong>officer dill</strong>: We found him in the morgue. The body
was missing and he was standing over the open cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What the hell were you doing there?!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Trying to steal the body, obviously… but you
fucked up and let someone get to it before I could.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Why did you want her body?</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: For a good reason.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: Information like that is very expensive and
you don’t have the balls to pay the price.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Lock this asshole up.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You think you can lock me up in this piss-ass
prison? Hell, this place is motel fuckin’ six to me.</p>
<p><strong>officer dill</strong>: Shut-up.</p>
<p><strong>duke</strong>: You better find that body right away you
incompetant dickhead because if it’s where I think it is…you’re gonna be
in world of shit.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Lock him the fuck up and after you do, I
want you to find that body – do you understand me! I don’t care what you
have to do, I don’t care where you have to go, FIND IT!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Aw, nothing. It’s taken care of.</p>
