<h1 id="signs">signs</h1>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Daaaad!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Bo where’s Morgan?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Bo?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Are you in my dreams too?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: This isn’t a –</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Morgan what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Are… you… hurt?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: I think God did it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Did what Morgan?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: … Lee actually the reason I’m calling is
about Lionel.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Was he at home last night with you or was he
out and about with the Wolfington brothers?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Well, there was a little mischief done to
our crops last night.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I know he’s a fine boy… No one’s saying
otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Listen Lee, I don’t even mind if it was him.
You could just talk to him and that would be enough for me… See it was
kind of strange finding the crops like that. The kids were… confused by
it. It would take the strangeness away if we knew it was Lionel and the
Wolfington brothers just messing around… The movies… Are you sure? Okay,
then… Thank you for your patience Lee.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Houdini peed. I think he’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Take him outside. I’ll call
Dr. Reynolds.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That was quick Edgar. I only called you boys
about two hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Mrs. Kindleman twisted her ankle as
she put it, “diving for her life” when a bunch of school kids rode down
the sidewalk on skateboards. She went down to Thorton’s store this
morning and started spitting on the new skateboards. Spitting! By the
time I got there, Mrs. Kindleman had sprayed the whole damn place… She
must have had a cold or something. It was enough to turn a grown man’s
stomach.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: So what happened to your crops?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I think it’s contaminated.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: You don’t even know what that word
means.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: It’s not contaminated. It’s just tap water.
Pour it in his bowl.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: It tastes funny.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: He licks his butt everyday. He’s not going
to mind.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Houdini?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Bo don’t run.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: What’s wrong boy?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Stop it Houdini!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Bo, run.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: It’s the strangest thing Father.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Don’t call me Father.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Don’t call me Father. It’s just Graham
now.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You said something was strange. What’s
strange?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: The footprints.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What about them?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: There are none.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Look at where it’s bent over.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s not broken.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: What kind of machine can bend a stalk
of corn over without cracking it?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Can’t be by hand… It’s too perfect.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Doesn’t sound much like Lionel
Prichard and the Wolfington brothers. They can’t take a piss without
wetting the front of their pants.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Second thing this week I can’t
explain.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What was the first thing?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Some animals around the county
exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo
Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Sounds like a virus.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: No Father, they’re edgy. On alert.
Like they act when they smell a predator around… Peeing on themselves
and everything.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Edgar, please don’t call me Father.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t hear my children.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: He wanted to kill Bo.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Did he hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m so sorry Morgan.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I used a little Tabasco in the potato
salad.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Houdini’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Please tie up Isabelle to the back of the
shed. Make sure the knot’s tight.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They’re tough cookies, those two. They think
Houdini’s playing with you up there. At least it got them to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Okay Miss Puzzle Master. I got one for you…
What can make geometric shapes the size of a football field… and what
would scare every animal in this county? Have you figured it out yet?
You probably have… Give me a hint Colleen… Is it bigger than a bread
box?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I saw a monster. Can I have a glass of
water?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What’s wrong with the water next to your
bed?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: It tastes old.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What’s the rule about getting up in the
middle of the night?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Only for pee or poop.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What are you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Why do you talk to mom when you’re by
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It makes me feel better.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Does she ever answer back?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: She doesn’t answer me either.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Get under a blanket. They can’t get you under
the blankets.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Okay, this guy is trying to scare us. He’s
messed with our property, he’s coming around the house. It’s time for an
ass whoopin’!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: This is not an intelligent way to approach
this.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: We both go outside and move around the
house in opposite directions. We act crazy, insane with anger. Make him
crap in his pants and force him around till we meet up on the other
side.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Explain, act crazy?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Curse and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m not going to curse.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: You don’t mean it. It’s just for show.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It doesn’t sound natural when I curse.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Just make noises then.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Explain noises.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Are you going to do this or what?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: You want him coming in the house next
time?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: On the count of three. One… two… three.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: We’re gonna beat your ass bitch!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Ahhhh… I’m insane with anger.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’ve lost my mind! It’s time for an ass
whoopin’!</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I’m gonna tear your head off!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I cursed.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I heard.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: It was very dark.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes it was.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: You can’t describe him at all? Don’t
you think that’s find of odd?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It does seem kind of odd doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: I don’t know whether to look for a
midget or a –</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He definitely wasn’t a midget.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Okay. So he was tall?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I would say so.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Over six feet?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: It was very dark.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes, it was.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: We’ve established that. Just tell me
about his clothing then.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Was he wearing a Scottish kilt or
jeans?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Let me ask you two something. Don’t
be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible… Just possible now, you
might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite
directions.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Edgar, it sounds as strange to me saying it,
as it is to you hearing it. But we couldn’t see him. He stayed mostly in
the shadows. All we could make out was movement. But I’ll tell you
something with absolute certainty. There was someone watching our house
last night. He was looking in my children’s windows and I want you to
find him Edgar. I need you to take this seriously, just incase, it is
something serious.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Can I use Bo’s old baby monitor as a
walkie-talkie?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: It needs batteries.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Edgar, come inside.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: How certain are you, that this was a
male?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I don’t know any girls can run like
that.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: These are D’s; I need double A’s.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I have some upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: I don’t know Merrill. I’ve seen some
of those women on the Olympics. They could out run me easy.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: This guy got on the roof in like a
second.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Bo, can you turn down the volume until
Officer Paski leaves?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: That roof is over ten feet high.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s telling you the truth, Edgar. Whoever
it was, is very strong and can jump pretty high.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: They got women’s high jumping in the
Olympics. They got these Scandinavian women who could jump clean over
me.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Shoot, it needs a screw driver. I have
double A’s in here.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I know you’re making a point Edgar. I just
don’t know what it is.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Yesterday afternoon, an out of town
woman stopped by the diner and started yelling and cussing cause they
didn’t have her favorite cigarettes at the vending machine. Scared a
couple of customers. No one’s seen her since… My point is, we don’t know
anything about the person you saw. We should just keep all possibilities
available.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Dad, where’s the remote?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Bo, you’re too old to still be doing this.
The rule is, you take a glass of water, you finish it. Now what’s wrong
with this one?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: There’s dust in it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: This one?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: A hair.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: This one?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Morgan took a sip. It has his amoebas in it.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Excluding the possibility that a female
Scandinavian Olympian was running around outside our house last night,
what else is a possibility?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: I’m not done asking questions and I
don’t appreciate the sarcasm.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Do you have anyone who might have a
grudge or something against you? Maybe a church member, who might not
have liked the fact, that you left the church?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Do you owe anybody money? You can
tell me off the record if you need too.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Is anything missing?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: It’s still making the noises. It’s
broken.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s old Morgan.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Listen, I was out of line with that whole
female Scandinavian Olympian thing.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: It’s just that, I’m pretty strong and
pretty fast. And I was running as fast as I could. And this guy… He was
just toying with us.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Could everyone just take a seat on
the couch. I have some preliminary thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: There are three possibilities here.
We’ll call them one, two and three. The level one scenario is that there
is a sane individual, who for real reasons wants to do you harm. I
really don’t believe that’s what we’re looking at here. In my opinion,
whoever this is, they don’t want to do harm to you all. That’s kind of
clear. The level two scenario is, this is a mentally unstable person
who’s fixated on you and your family. This is a possibility, but a very
slim one. I assure you I will treat all three possibilities carefully,
but in all likely hood we are looking at what we’ll call a level three
scenario. He’s a watcher. Someone who this is a game for. He’s laying
low. Doesn’t want to be seen. But he wants to watch you. Study you
folks.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Now I don’t want you all to worry
about this no more. You’re making more of this than it is. You guys have
had a tough couple of days with the vandalism to the crops and the death
of your shepherd. Maybe you guys should do something fun? Let me worry
about this person. Let me find out who it is and then – What the hell
are you people looking at?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Turn up the volume Bo.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I can’t find the remote.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: – images were shot yesterday afternoon by
a thirty-four year old local camera man in Kerala, a southern city of
India. It is the eighteenth reported crop circle found in that country
in the last seventy-two hours.</p>
<p><strong>professor</strong>: Crop circles first emerged in the late
seventies with the renewed interest in extraterrestrial life. They died
out by the early eighties; dismissed as hoaxes. This new resurgence is
wholly different. Elements of it are unexplainable. The speed and the
quantity in which it has appeared implies the coordination of hundreds
of individuals over many countries… There is only a limited amount of
explanations. Either this is one of the most elaborate hoaxes ever
created, or basically… It’s for real.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Extraterrestrials.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: What in God’s name is going on?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Don’t ask me what I think. Cause I
can’t think straight right now. I’m going back to the station. Have a
cup of Marcia’s coffee and try to think clear. After that I might make
some calls. Hoaxes… People got way too much time on their hands.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: But I’ll tell you something, what I
said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot
in the last two days… Not to mention what happened to you all seven
months ago.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Six months.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: And three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: It’s left its mark still. The last
thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things
happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds – your
mind, on everyday things. It’s good medicine.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s good advice… Say hi to Marcia for
me.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: You take care of yourself…
Graham.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: … signs intended to be seen from the
sky –</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No radio either… Just for a while.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Book money.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Only one.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Meet back in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Extraterrestrials?</p>
<p><strong>mr. nathan</strong>: That’s what they keep alluding to. It’s
just a bunch of crock. They’re trying to sell sodas, plain and simple.
I’ve been watching these reports since morning. I’ve seen twelve soda
commercials so far. Twelve!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Do you have book on extraterrestrials?</p>
<p><strong>mr. nathan</strong>: Don’t tell me you believe this horse
manure?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. nathan</strong>: As a matter of fact, I think we have
one. Came by mistake in a shipment. Decided to keep it for city
people.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. nathan</strong>: Last row. Third book from the left
honey.</p>
<p><strong>radio host</strong>: Why is no one saying the obvious? This
is just a rash case of copycats. Someone, somewhere, does the first one.
It’s on TV, it’s on the internet. In less than an hour a couple hundred
people get the same brilliant idea and here we are… on the verge of mass
hysteria.</p>
<p><strong>pharmacist</strong>: It was asthma medicine right Father?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: For Morgan Hess. And it’s not Father
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>pharmacist</strong>: Can I ask you a favor Father?</p>
<p><strong>pharmacist</strong>: Can I take confession with you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Tracey, I – am – not – a – reverend –
anymore. I haven’t been for six months. You know this.</p>
<p><strong>tracey</strong>: All this stuff on TV… Joe Gills was in here
talking about the end of the world… I’m just a little scared. Please. I
need to take confession with you.</p>
<p><strong>crewcut guy</strong>: I got it figured.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>crewcut guy</strong>: I’ve had two separate folks tell me
they think there are strangers around these parts the last couple of
nights. Can’t tell what they look like, cause they’re staying in the
shadows – covert like. No one’s got hurt mind you… And that’s the give
away.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>crewcut guy</strong>: It’s called probing. It’s a military
procedure. You send a reconnaissance group, very small, to check out
things. Not to engage, but to evaluate the situation. Evaluate the level
of danger. Make sure things are all clear…</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Clear for what?</p>
<p><strong>crewcut guy</strong>: … For the rest of them.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: You have a pamphlet or something I can
read?</p>
<p><strong>crewcut guy</strong>: Hey you didn’t used to play baseball
did you?</p>
<p><strong>crewcut guy</strong>: Shit. I know you. You’re Merrill Hess.
I was there that day you hit that five hundred and eighty seven footer
over the left field wall and set the record. That thing had a motor on
it… It’s still the record right?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I got the bat at home… On the wall.</p>
<p><strong>crewcut guy</strong>: You got two minor league home run
records don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Five. The five longest.</p>
<p><strong>crewcut guy</strong>: Boy, why aren’t you in the pros making
stacks of cash and getting handfuls of T and A?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Cause he also has the minor league strike
out record.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Hello Lionel.</p>
<p><strong>lionel</strong>: He’d just swing as hard as he could every
time. It didn’t matter what the coach said, didn’t matter who was on
base, he’d whip that bat through the air as hard as he could… Looked
like a lumber jack chopping down a tree. Merrill here, struck out more
times than any two players.</p>
<p><strong>crewcut guy</strong>: You really hold the strike out
record?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Felt wrong not to swing.</p>
<p><strong>pharmacist</strong>: I cursed thirty-seven times last week… I
said the f-word a couple times, but mostly “shits” and “bastards.” Is
“Douche bag” a curse?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I suppose it’s in its usage.</p>
<p><strong>pharmacist</strong>: How about “John you’re a douche bag for
kissing Barbara?”</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That’s a curse.</p>
<p><strong>pharmacist</strong>: Then it’s not thirty-seven. It’s
seventy-one.</p>
<p><strong>pharmacist</strong>: I stole a bottle of Ruby red lip stick
from K-mart… I punched my brother in the back three times…</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: It’s contaminated.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. nathan</strong>: Carl, there’s something wrong with our
water!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Your water is fine. Bo has a thing about her
drinking water. She’s had it her whole life. Like a tick people have.
Except it’s not a tick.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. nathan</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>mr. nathan</strong>: Thirteen!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Pharmacy crowded?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t want any one of you spending time
with Tracey Abernathy alone. Is that understood?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Is that him?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: He’s the man who killed mom.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: What if Bo’s baby monitor is picking up
signals from the extraterrestrials?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: All this crop stuff. They did it
twenty-five years ago. It was a joke.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s just static Morgan. Turn it up and
see.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: It’s a code.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Let me see that please.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: It’s noise.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s broken Morgan. It’ll just keep doing
this. Let’s get out of the car okay?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: We might lose the signal.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We can’t just sit in the car in our own
driveway like this.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: We’ll look like mental patients.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m getting out now.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Nobody move!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Voices. Did you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Not English though. You heard the voices
right Uncle Merrill?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I heard them Morgan.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s probably picking up another baby
monitor.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Let me see it.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: It doesn’t sound like words.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: See this is why we’re not watching those
news reports. People get obsessed. I’m letting go now.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: No dad!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: You’ll lose the signal!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Don’t let go.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Morgan?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: It gets clearer, the higher you hold it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Morgan, be careful.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I got him.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Merrill you got her.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: There’s two of them talking.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: They hung up.</p>
<p><strong>we are at the edge of the crops looking back at the
house.</strong>: The LIGHTS are on in the kitchen. We see Graham,
Merrill and the children doing dishes after dinner.</p>
<p><strong>our view turns to look at the barn through the
crops.</strong>: Isabelle, the remaining German Shepherd is tied to a
post outside the barn. The dog whips back and forth frantically. She
keeps looking in our direction.</p>
<p><strong>we hear a screen door open. we turn to look back at
the</strong>: HOUSE. Graham steps out the back screen door with a bowl
of dog food and a bowl of water.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You know something? Even entertaining the
possibility of this for a minute has been exciting.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I can see how people can get carried away
with this type of thing.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s a kind of faith. It’s an intoxicating
thing to believe in something you can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>the beam of light falls on the wall of corn crops lining
the</strong>: BACKYARD. Graham steps right up to them. He hesitates and
then steps into the field of</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You were always good at that…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Believing in things you couldn’t see. You
would have been the first person on that station wagon wouldn’t you? You
and Morgan would have been wrestling for that baby monitor.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’ll be secretly kind of sad for everybody,
when this turns out to be – all just make believe.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You’re wasting your time here! I’m not going
to report this or anything you do to me crops, to the news or TV or
anybody! You’re not going to get famous!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Okay. Let’s turn on the TV.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: – first appeared fifty two minutes
ago.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: Mexico City officials as well as U.S.
officials have confirmed that these are not air crafts from either
government’s airforce. The first sighting was made by an Air Mexico 747
en route from Mazatlan to New York as the unidentified crafts entered
Mexico City air space. They were not detected by radar by either
country.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: The crazies were right.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: We have to tape this…</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: My ballet recital.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Listen Bo. This is very important.
Everything people have written about in science books is going to
change. The history of the world’s future is on the TV right now. We
need to record this so you can show your children this tape and say you
were there… For your children Bo.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: My ballet recital.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Find another tape.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Uncle Merrill, I’m using your tape.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: … You’re seeing a live feed from our NBC
affiliate down in Mexico City. The time there is 7:17pm. This image has
not been adjusted or enhanced in any way. What you’re seeing is real.
Everything they wrote in science books is about to change.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Told you.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Some people are probably thinking this is
the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Do you think it’s a possibility?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: How can you say that?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That wasn’t the answer you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Can you at least pretend to be like you
used to be? Give me some comfort?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: … There are all different ways you can tell
that there’s someone really there watching out for us. You see signs.
Sometimes they’re little ones. You think of someone. The phone rings.
They’re on the phone… Sometimes they’re big, like fourteen lights
hovering over Mexico City. Sure, there are a lot of people watching this
who think this could be a bad thing. But there are a lot of people
watching this, who think it’s a miracle. A sign of God’s existence. It’s
all in how you look at things Merrill. What you have to decide is what
kind of person you are? Are you the type who believes in miracles and
looks for signs or are you the kind who believes, things just happen by
chance?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I was at this party once. I’m on a couch
with Sara Mckinney. She was just sitting there, looking beautiful and
staring at me. I go to lean in and kiss her and I realize I have gum in
my mouth. I turn and take out the gum. Stuff it in my paper cup next to
the sofa and turn around. Sara Mckinney throws up all over herself. I
knew the second it happened. It was a miracle. I could have been kissing
her when she threw up. That would have scarred me for life. I may never
have recovered.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I’m a miracle man. Those lights are a
miracle.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: There you go.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: So which type are you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Do you feel comforted?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What does it matter then?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Do you know what Colleen’s last words were
before they killed her?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: She said, “See”, and then her eyes glazed a
bit and she said… “Tell Merrill to swing away.”</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Do you know why she said that?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Because the nerve endings in her brain were
firing as she died, and some random memory of us at one of your baseball
games popped into her head. There is no one watching out for us Merrill.
We’re all on our own.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: For the kids protection. All they were
doing was watching TV from five a.m. I felt like they were getting
obsessed like you said. They should be playing furry, furry rabbit or
tea party or something right?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What’s furry, furry rabbit?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: That’s a game isn’t it? Anyway… There’s
been some interesting developments.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Eleven a.m. They’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: But they’re not really gone. We just can’t
see them. Early this morning a bird flew right at the area where the
lights were hovering last night.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: It stopped dead in the air and fell
straight down.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: They caught it on tape and they’ve been
playing it all morning. They found the bird. His head crushed in. When
you see the footage it looks like the bird flew into a wall in the sky.
They think they have some invisible shield thing going, like an optical
illusion.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The bird could have had a heart attack and
crushed his head when he fell.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Already thought of. Two other birds did the
same thing an hour later. Not as dramatic. They lived. But you could see
they hit something.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: They’re still there hovering. In fact, some
people think there’s more of them now. All over the place. Over us even.
And there’s a theory about the crop circles now. They think it could be
some kind of landmark, visual mapping system – so they can navigate.
Coordinate. Makes sense doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: So the aliens can’t read our minds.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: They tell you everything in this book.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: It says they’re probably very small – like
my height – because, as their brains developed, there was no use for
physical development. It says they’re probably vegetarians, because they
would have realized the benefits of such a diet.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Who wrote this book?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Scientists who have been persecuted for
their beliefs.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That means they’re unemployed.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Dad, are you going to be serious?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Yeah, serious.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t know what got into me.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: There are pictures.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Dr. Bimboo, one of the authors of the book
–</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Bimboo?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I just asked his name.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: You had a tone.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: He says there are two reasons why
Extraterrestrials would visit us.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: To make contact in the spirit of exploration
and furthering the knowledge of the universe.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Or the other reason… They’re hostile.
They’ve used up the resources on their planet and are looking to harvest
our planet next.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Looks a little like our house doesn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: The same windows.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: That’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: That’s enough from Dr. Bimboo for now.
Everybody in this house needs to calm down and eat some fruit or
something.</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: Father.</p>
<p><strong>through the phone we hear sudden scuffling, a chair
squeal</strong>: AGAINST THE FLOOR and then the phone disconnects.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m going out for a few minutes. No one
leaves this house. No one.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Ray Reddy’s house.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I think he just called here.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: You don’t think something bad will happen do you
Morgan?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Why, you got one of your feeling again?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Is it bad?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: If it does, I won’t let anything bad happen
to you.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I don’t want you to die.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Who said I was going to die?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Who said I was going to die?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Come on Bo. I need to keep a look out.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Hello Ray.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What happened Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I wrote your number down to call you. It’s been
sitting next to the phone for six months. When I knew it was inside the
house, I couldn’t think of any other number to call. I panicked. Thank
you for coming Father.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You’re welcome Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I worked so long that night. I ain’t never
fallen asleep driving before. And never since. Most of the ride home,
there wasn’t a car insight in either direction. If I’d fallen asleep
then, I’d a ended up in a ditch with a head ache. It had to happen at
that right moment. That certain ten-fifteen seconds when I passed her
walking. It was like it was meant to be.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I guess if this is the end of the world, I’m
screwed right? People who kill Reverends’ wives aren’t exactly ushered
to the front of the line in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Where you going Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: To the lake. The way I see it, all the places
marked in the crops and such – none of them are really near water. I
figure they don’t like water. Can’t be any worse than here.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Ray, did you see one of them?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m truly sorry for what I’ve done to you and
yours.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: And don’t open my pantry Father. I locked one
of them in there.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: … The startling footage we’re about to
show you was photographed by a forty-two year old Romero Valadares.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: This video was taken yesterday afternoon
at his son’s seventh birthday, in the city of Passo Fundo, Brazil. It
was sent to the local news bureau there and satellited to us a few
minutes ago. All initial opinions are; this is genuine.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: What you are about to see, may disturb
you.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Move children! Vamonos!</p>
<p><strong>boy with hat</strong>: Esta atras da garagem! Esta atras de
ai! Is behind!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The police are here… I am with them… I am a
police officer. I just want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We know all about the hoax. We already took
some of your friends downtown in the paddy wagon. Paddy wagon?</p>
<p><strong>the only sound in the kitchen is the sound of the
faucet</strong>: RUNNING. Graham waits for a reply, but none comes.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: If you tell us your name and why you did it,
we’ll give you the same deal we gave the others. Don’t throw away your
life son.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Douche bag.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: They’re skin changes color. That’s why we
couldn’t see him that night.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Tell me something Morgan. In that book of
your, did they happen to detail what would happen if they were
hostile?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Yes. They would invade us using only ground
tactics. Hand to hand combat. They wouldn’t use their technology or
fight an airborne battle, because they would know we would eventually
use nuclear weapons and the planet would be useless to them.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I’m sorry, what book is this?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Did they say what our chances would be if
they did invade?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: They said one of two things could happen.
One, they fight and are defeated and leave to return again with full
forces hundreds or even thousands of years later.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What’s two?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: They win.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What do you think about the idea that they
don’t like places near water, and we might be safe from them near a lake
or something?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Sounds made up.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We can choose to believe it and pack up and
leave. Or we can stay here. Board up this house. Hide inside our home
and wait it out. Either way, at least we’ll be together. All those in
favor of the lake, raise your hand.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: All those in favor of home, raise your
hand.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: How do we know boards will do anything?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Because, they seem to have trouble with
pantry doors.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Come quick!</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: Tel Aviv joins Nairobi, Lagos and
Jerusalem as the latest to confirm the appearance of lights. There are
lights in the skies over an estimated two hundred and seventy four
cities. That total could be as high as four hundred within the hour.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They decided to show themselves.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: They think these look like stages
immediately proceeding an attack maneuver.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: It’s like War of the Worlds.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: They think it might happen all at once.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: Hundreds of thousands have flocked to
synagogues, churches and temples.</p>
<p><strong>tv anchor</strong>: Ground forces are being assembled in
countries throughout the globe…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m going to get back to the windows.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: You guys okay?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Some guy had a sign that said it was the end
of the world. Nothing really bad is going to happen, is it Uncle
Merrill?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: You sure right?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: You know about signs Morgan? Not like the
ones people write on. It’s like if you poured a glass of milk and you
dropped the glass by mistake and broke it before you could drink it.
Then you looked at the milk carton and saw that the milk was spoiled.
They’re things that happen by chance or luck, but make you feel that
someone’s watching out for you.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: I once had a bad dream and I couldn’t wake
up. I kicked at the table next to my bed and something fell on me and I
woke up. It was a picture of mom. She was smiling. It made me feel safe…
You mean like that?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Yeah, like that. I believe in signs Morgan.
I think there’s someone watching out for us. I got to believe he’s going
to make sure we’re all right in the end.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Too many windows in the bedrooms. We don’t
have enough boards.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We’ll have to board up the bedroom
doors.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Where are we going to sleep?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The family room.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: What about Isabelle?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We’ll keep her in the garage, after
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I’ll make sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I want spaghetti?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: We should eat fast Bo.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Spaghetti sounds great.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What do you want, Morgan?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: French toast… and mashed potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Now we’re talking. How about you
Merrill?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Chicken Teriyaki.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Good choice… I’m going to have a
cheeseburger with bacon. Extra bacon.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What’s the matter with everyone? Eat.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I don’t want to hear anymore talk like that.
And I don’t want to see anymore faces like the ones I’m looking at. We
are going to enjoy this meal. Nothing can stop us from enjoying this
meal! Enjoy!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Stop crying!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Don’t yell at her!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Fine, if you all don’t want to eat, then I’m
going to have some of everything.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: This tastes so great.</p>
<p><strong>the symbol and tone appear on every channel. the
monotone</strong>: SOUND FILLS THE CLOSET. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Graham hurry.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Did I ever tell you what everyone said when
you were born, Bo?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You came out of your momma and you didn’t
even cry. You just opened your eyes and looked around at everybody. Your
eyes were so big and gorgeous, the ladies in the room gasped.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They literally gasped. Then they go, “She’s
like an angel.” They said, “We’ve never seen a baby so beautiful.”</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: And you know what else happened?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: When they put you on the table to clean you
up, you looked at me and smiled. They say babies that young can’t smile…
You smiled.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Let’s go down now.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: We forgot about Isabelle.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Should we turn off the lights?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They already know we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Dad –</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Do you know what happened when you were born
Morgan?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You came out and your momma kept bleeding.
The doctors rushed you out of the room before I could even see you.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: They’re on the roof.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: While they were trying to fix her up, all
she kept asking about was you.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: They’re in the house.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I wanted your momma to see you first. She
had dreamed about you her whole life. They waited till she felt better,
then they brought you in. They placed you right in her arms. And she
looked at you. And you looked at her. You just stared at each other for
the longest time and then she said real soft, “Hello Morgan, I’m you
momma, you look just like I dreamed.”</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: The attic door.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: This is a very temporary solution.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: How temporary?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Twenty-two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Let go.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: This is going to do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We have to go in the basement.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: There’s no way out of there.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Did I ever tell you, I dislocated Uncle
Merrill’s arm?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Should we make a run for it out the
back?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They’re right behind the door.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He was only a year and half old.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He was trying to eat a second chocolate bar.
Your grandma said, “No.” He tried to take a bite, so I grabbed it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I must have pulled his arm at an awkward
angle. His elbow popped right out of the socket.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He didn’t scream or anything. His arm just
flopped to his side and he got real still.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: They’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I held him in my lap in the back seat as we
drove to the hospital. I couldn’t stop crying… We need to go into the
basement now.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You know what your Uncle Merrill did right
after the doctor put his arm back in place? He jumped off the table and
gave me a hug. He had already forgotten that I was the one who hurt
him.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: We won’t be able to get out of there.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m sorry I hurt your arm.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: We forgot our foil helmets!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We need something to wedge against the
doorknob.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: They’ll read our minds!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You’re scaring your sister.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I’m already scared.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Merrill –</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I’m looking!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: They’ll know our secret thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Merrill!</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Got it!</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Where’s Bo?</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: What’s happening out there?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I can’t even imagine.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: I hope they’re doing better than we are. We
don’t even have helmets.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They’re just making noises. They’re not
trying to get in. Why are they doing that?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: They want our attention on the door?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They’re distracting us?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: From what?</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: The book says they’re probably very good
problem solvers.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: What book!</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: They’ll find a way in.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Morgan, give me your flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Is there an air vent in here?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I can feel air.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: It’s getting stronger.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I’m close.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Hold the vent!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Pull him!</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: We don’t have his medicine.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Don’t be scared Morgan. We’ll slow it down
together. Feel my chest. Feel it going in and out. Breathe like me.
Breathe like me.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: He can’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Stay with me. Stay with me. I know it hurts.
Be strong baby… It’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Don’t do this to me again. Not again.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I hate you. I hate you…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: The fear is feeding it… Don’t be afraid of
what’s happening… Believe it’s going to pass… Believe it… Just wait…
Don’t be afraid… The air is coming… Believe… We don’t have to be afraid…
It’s about to pass… Here it comes… Don’t be afraid… Here comes the
air…</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: There we go… We don’t have to be scared at
all… We know it’ll pass. We believe it… Don’t be afraid Morgan.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Feel my chest… Breathe with me. Together…
The air is going in our lungs… Together… We’re the same. We’re the
same.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I should save the flashlights.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: … Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain have also
confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I found a pack of light bulbs.</p>
<p><strong>radio voice</strong>: … Parts of China and Northern Korea are
among the few remaining to verify withdrawals.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: They’re broadcasting…</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: It came on about two hours ago. Woke me up.
We won Graham.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: It went on all night. Everywhere. It was
completely a ground battle. Mostly hand to hand. You can’t see them
unless you’re up close. A lot of people died. Some from combat. But most
from poison gas inhalation. They secrete it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: How many died?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: They think over a hundred thousand. They’re
just estimates. But we held strong.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: How do they know it’s over?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: A mass evacuation by them started about
eight o’clock this morning. It’s eleven now. They’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: You didn’t think we’d make it.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Listen, there’s things I can take and a
couple things I can’t and one of them I can’t take, is when my older
brother – – who is everything I want to be, starts losing faith in
things. I saw your eyes last night. I don’t want to ever see your eyes
like that again, okay? I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: He’s been like that for awhile. We need to
get him some medicine.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Have they said anything about our area?</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Philadelphia and its outlying counties are
cleared, but who knows for sure?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s not strong enough to fight off another
attack.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: I know. We need to be sure, before we open
that door Graham.</p>
<p><strong>there are no noises, no spikes, no voices… just
empty</strong>: ELECTRICAL STATIC. Beat.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: That’s good enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Get the syringe as well. We might need to
give him an epinephrine shot.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: People are dancing.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You want to see it?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’ll bring the TV in here.</p>
<p><strong>tv reporter</strong>: Today there are no countries, and no
races, and no differences – we are all apart of the same –</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: He’s reading my –</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: What do you know?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: There was an accident. Drunk driving. They
weren’t sure.</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: He wasn’t drinking. Ray fell asleep
at the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Yes… That’s the first thing Colleen
asked too.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: She’s talking… Which ambulance is she
in?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: She’s not in an ambulance Father.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: See Father, Ray’s truck swerved off
the road and ah… Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the
two.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Pinned? What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: The truck… the truck has severed most
of her lower half.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: She won’t be saved. At this point
she’s alive, because the truck is holding her together. She doesn’t feel
much, and she’s talking almost like normal. We didn’t pull the truck
out, cause we wanted you to come down here to be with her, as long as
she’s awake. That won’t be very long. Father, you understand what I’ve
told you?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Edgar. Is this the last time I’m going to
talk to my wife?</p>
<p><strong>officer paski</strong>: Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Hi sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Hi baby.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: I was just taking a walk before dinner.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: You love walks.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: I guess it was meant to be.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: I don’t feel much.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: … Tell Morgan to play games – it’s okay to
be silly.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: … I will.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: … Tell Bo to listen to her brother. He’ll
always take care of her.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: … I will.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: … Tell Graham –</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: Tell him… See. Tell him to see.</p>
<p><strong>colleen</strong>: And tell Merrill to swing away.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: What? Colleen?… Colleen?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Swing away, Merrill.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Merrill.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Swing away.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: His lungs were closed. His lungs were
closed. No poison got in… No poison got in.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: His lungs were closed.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Don’t touch him.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Graham.</p>
<p><strong>bo</strong>: Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Don’t touch him.</p>
<p><strong>merrill</strong>: Graham.</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>morgan’s voice</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>morgan</strong>: Did someone save me?</p>
<p><strong>graham</strong>: Yeah baby. I think someone did.</p>
