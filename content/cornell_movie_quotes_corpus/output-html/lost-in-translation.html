<p><strong>bob</strong>: How long have you been married?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Two years.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Try twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You’re probably just having a mid- life
crisis. Did you buy a Porche?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: 25 years… that’s a long time… Are you
still in love with your wife?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes… I don’t know, I don’t know her anymore. I
don’t know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was…
actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And
one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said
okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois, and
she’s still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia… but I always
really liked Lydia.</p>

spring.</p>

<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, what do you do with that?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I don’t know, but I can think about it, a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It takes a while to figure it out. I’m sure you
will, though.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Thanks. I’m sure your mid-life crisis
will work out,too.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I wish I could sleep BOB Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: John! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m just here shooting this band, what about
you?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Promoting that action movie I did…</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: …doing like twenty million interviews a day…
It’s soo good to see you. How long are you here for?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re here for the week. I’m shooting in Osaka
for a few days.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: It’s amazing there!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Have you met Charlotte? My wife.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: No! Hi! So great to meet you!</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Hi, nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: You know, John, you’re my favorite
photographer, I only want to be shot by you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh..thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: Sorry if I have the worst B.O., I’ve been
sweating in this little room with T.V. lights for hours…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: …Well, I have the worst headache, I have to
go find some aspirin. But, call me, let’s have a drink, I’m under Evelyn
Waugh.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ok, see you later.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Evelyn Waugh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Evelyn Waugh was a man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, c’mon, she’s nice. Not everyone went to
Yale.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Its just a pseudonym, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Why do you have to defend her?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not, but do you have to point out how
stupid everyone is.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: No, I thought it was funny. Forget
it.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: We should get going.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: OK, I’ll see you later.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Hi, leave a message…</p>
<p><strong>voice mail</strong>: You have eighteen new messages. Press
-</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hi Charlotte, I don’t know if you’re in
town… but I’m having a birthday party for my dog, Louise, tomorrow
night, at my house around eight…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: fabulous time in Japan! How exciting, and
hope you and your adorable husband are enjoying it…I was sitting next to
Cathryn Myles last night at this dinner and she was telling me about her
daughter who had this awful boyfriend and a messy break-up and how hard
it is,and now she’s single and wants to start a family, I’m so glad that
you’re settled, and not in that situation. Anyway, call me when you have
a chance, I’m trying to put Thanksgiving plans together, whether we want
to go skiing or. Daddy wants to stay home and have it here, which might
be easier with Lauren and the children, but let me know what your
feelings are, I do hope you and John can make it. Call me, I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>voice mail</strong>: Charlotte hangs up</p>
<p><strong>sweaty journalist</strong>: What was it like working with
Keanu Reeves?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: It was great. I’ve known him for a while now-
you know we both live in L.A. We both have dogs…</p>
<p><strong>dr. kenegard</strong>: Plato’s text calls this image the
“paradeigma”. So the lot is the image that is your inheritance, your
place on earth, all compacted into a pattern that has been selected by
your soul before you even got here- or better said, that is always and
continually being selected by your soul,because time does not enter the
equation of myth.-</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: How’d it go today?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good…I’m tired.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs.
She wants to talk about some photo thing.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Ok. Maybe I’ll walk down with you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You wanna come?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: …My Dad was anorexic.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: He was on the American side at the Bay of
Pigs, in Cuba, and he was taken prisoner, and they tortured them about
their food the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>benzo</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: My dad fought on the American side at the Bay
of Pigs. So, when he was a prisoner, they would tell them they had put
poison in their food and they would make themselves throw up… and when
he got back, he did better, but he still has food issues. He has to have
really clean food. And really simple. He can’t just go have, say,
Chinese food.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, that’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>benzo</strong>: How crazy is this shit?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Yeah, it is.</p>
<p><strong>kelly</strong>: …Oh my god you have to try it, this power
cleanse is amazing- it’s lemon juice and grade B maple syrup and cayenne
pepper for seven days. Just like a half a teaspoon of cayenne. The first
few days you’re a little scattered, but by day four - it’s amazing… my
eyes were so white…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Hi again, how’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Who do I have to fuck to get off this
planet?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, what are you talking about.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I went to a temple today and I didn’t
feel anything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I don’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s ok, you’ll figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You smell weird.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Like popcorn?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I got some hair stuff.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Hair stuff?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I gotta go to work.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll be right down…I’m just leaving…ok.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Lauren?</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Charlotte?! How’s Tokyo?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: It’s cool… but,I don’t know… I went to a
shrine today and all these little monk’s were chanting… and, I didn’t
feel anything… I even tried ikebana, … and John’s using hair products… I
don’t know who</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Oh, wait, can you hold on one sec?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Sorry about that, what were you saying?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh, it’s nothing… I better go, I’ll talk
to you later.</p>
<p><strong>lauren</strong>: Ok, have fun there, you’re so lucky you
don’t have any kids yet and you can go off to Japan… call me when you
get back.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Ok, bye.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: At the fitting, they had all these rock n roll
clothes, the label guys kept saying lock n loll, though, but the band
doesn’t look tough at all…they look better just skinny and nerdy, like
how when they came in…they looked so uncomfortable in these Keith
Richards clothes, they should just be like they are, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, I think you’re probably right… because
when you try to…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Do you think it’s done?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will you please stop smoking?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: But I like to… and I don’t smoke that
much.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Its bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Ok, I will… later.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A Soul’s Search: Finding Your True Character
and calling? Is this yours?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh… that’s nothing, someone gave it to
me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t have to be embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I’m not. It’s just corny, but I’m not
into it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s ok if you are.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, the record company sent these…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Mmm, I love Cristal, let’s have some.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I gotta go… and I don’t really like
champagne.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you sure you want to stay?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Are you sure you have to go?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Yeah, I know you have to work the whole
time, I’ll probably have more fun here. I’ll call Charlie and those
guys.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ok, definitely call them, I’ll be back Friday.
I love you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’ll just be a few days.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh, hi.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi. Did you have a nice swim?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Yeah. Did you get some sleep?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, how about you?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Not really. How long are you here
for?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m here for the week.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party
tonight with me and some friends who live here?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You really are having a mid-life
crisis.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know, it’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: A Soul’s Search: Finding Your True Calling -
are you reading this?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I read it, too.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Charlie, this is Bob. Bob � Charlie
Brown.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: His real name’s Hayashi, but someone
started calling him Charlie because they thought he looked like Charlie
Brown. They’ve all got American nicknames because its easier for me to
remember… they were just out in L.A. last month doing a shoot with John…
that guy’s Mr.Valentine, he’s the art director of their magazine, I
don’t even know his real name, or why I call him that.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: This is Bambi.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>bambi</strong>: How’s california?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>bambi</strong>: Good… I like your swimming pool.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Thanks, you guys should come back
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>bambi</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bambi</strong>: Kawaii.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: What do you feel like singing, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You bite your nails?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I could cut the ones that are left for
you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>hans</strong>: I’m Hans.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Hans? Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Make sure she gets home okay?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Are you ok?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I don’t want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know. I don’t either.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lydia?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Hello, darling.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this
guy designed and built, you would have loved it.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He was this fashion guy, and there were all
these Japanese fashion people- it’s a whole other world, and I was
talking to these Japanese surfers… He was playing all this great music-
I have to find out what it was…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: That sounds great � can you hold on… What
Zoe?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well, you have to have something for
breakfast. Do you want cereal?</p>
<p><strong>zoe</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Just trying to get her to eat something…I’m
glad you’re having fun.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, its really different here.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well, that’s good, I have to get the kids off
for school. Can I call you in a little while?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s four in the morning… I’m going to go to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Ok, well… I love you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning
.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Good-night.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: It’s Charlotte.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Charlotte, who?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Thanks for getting me back in one
piece.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Do you want to have some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, I’m going to take a shower and I’ll meet
you downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: OK, see you downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Hey look, it’s Sausalito.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I see them every morning.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hans was very attentive to you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I think he kind of liked me…Is that so
hard to imagine?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, its easy.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: How’d a Japanese guy get a name like
Hans?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Do you remember when we met at the bar?
…You were wearing a tuxedo.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But the first time I saw you was in the
elevator.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, you don’t remember?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Did I scowl at you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, you smiled.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know, I kind of blend in here.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Why do they switch the r’s and l’s
here?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know. My fax said “have a good
fright”.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Let’s never come here again, because it
would never be as much fun.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ok, whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Did you see Hiromix last night dancing
with Bambi?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, I was looking at you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh. Well… they were dancing on the couch
with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the
Sex Pistols on Kings Road…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh, for her show?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her
show.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re possessive.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I’m stuck. Does it get easier.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, yes, it does…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Yeah? But look at you.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are…
you don’t care about things the same way…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I just don’t know what I’m supposed to
be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer… but I hate what I write,
and I tried taking pictures, but John’s so good at that, and mine are so
mediocre… and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses,
you know dumb pictures of your feet…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’ll figure it out. I’m not worried about
you. Keep writing.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: But, I’m mean.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: And marriage, does that get easier?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s hard. We started going to a marriage
counselor.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Did that help? Did you learn
anything?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We established that we have no
communication.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We used to have fun, she used to like to go to
places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but
now she’s tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she
doesn’t need me, and they don’t need me, I feel like I’m in the way. It
gets complicated when you have kids… that changes everything.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: That’s too scary.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: When they’re born its like Vietnam. It’s
terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: No one ever tells you that…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: But, it’s great being with them, after they can
talk, and can do things with you.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: That’s nice. My parents were always
traveling, they weren’t around so much.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where’d you grow up?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to
France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years…
but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around… and then I
moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married… it’s so different
there.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: John thinks I’m so snotty.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You are.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I know, but that’s what you like about
me.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Why do you have to be with your opposite,
why cant similar people be together?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Because that would be too easy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>reception</strong>: Mr. Harris, we have fax for you!</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>reception</strong>: Do you want I send it to your room?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>reception</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Harris.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Miss Kawasaki? It’s Bob Harris… I’m not going
to be able to do that interview today.., yeah… ok…. Yes, I’d love to
stay to be on his talk show… sure.. ok… bye.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You made it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: They really have to work on that street name
thing.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: It’s for my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: How old is she?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh, she’ll love it.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Nice one.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What happened to your toe?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I don’t know, I think maybe I broke it? I
knocked into something the other day…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That doesn’t look good.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: It’s bad isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We should get you to the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, look at that thing.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: How do you say “hospital” in Japanese?</p>
<p><strong>reception</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hospital?</p>
<p><strong>reception</strong>: One moment, please.</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: Concierge desk, may I help you?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes, can you tell me how to say “hospital” in
Japanese?</p>
<p><strong>concierge</strong>: “Hospital” in Japanese? Hosupitari.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hosupitari?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: Bob, it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, hi, Elaine.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: So, we got you on an earlier flight, but I
really think you should think about staying for that talk show.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>elaine</strong>: You’ll do it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, I’ll stay.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Is that for me?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Bob?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hi, Lydia.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Is this a bad time?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Uh, no.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: It’s really hard to reach you… Did you get
the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Ok, whatever you think… I’m lost.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: It’s just carpet.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s not what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Is there anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know… I want to be more healthy. I want
to eat better.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You know, eat healthier.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Alright?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Not all that pasta.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Like Japanese food.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Why don’t you just stay there, and you can
have it everyday.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Oh, come on.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I have to go, Adam’s tormenting Zoe, I’ll
talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yeah, I’ll be fine. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Hi Bob, it’s Charlotte… how are you doing
today?… I’m going to meet Charlie and those guys at this place called
Orange around ten… come meet us if you get this…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: How long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: C’mon, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Where’s your husband?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Working.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do you ever see him?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Do you know where we are?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Isn’t it weird there are no street names
in Tokyo… you’d think a city like this would have street names… you need
a map to get anywhere… look, there are no signs…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Um..Hi, John, if this is your phone? I’m
not sure…I’m going to go to Kyoto for the day…I’11 try you when I get
back. Hope it’s going good… I love you, bye.</p>
<p><strong>tv host</strong>: We hear you’re quite a golfer.</p>

<p><strong>translator</strong>: They now have the competition for you
with the Iron Chef.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Rough night?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I’m going to Daikanyama, do you want to
come walk around?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Yes, but no, I can’t right now.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Oh, I guess you’re busy, huh.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t want to be.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Hello, Bob, it’s me.</p>

<p><strong>bob</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: You can’t get sushi anywhere in Japan
after 2 o’clock. Did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: No, we’ll find something around here.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: The Jazz singer? The red-head?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: Well, I guess she’s more around your age…
You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the
fifties.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: You’re a brat, wasn’t there anyone else around
to lavish you with attention?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I can’t tell the difference?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We’ll have two of these.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What do you want to drink?</p>

<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: When are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>

<p><strong>new singer</strong>: Good Evening. I’m Carl West, and we’re
thrilled to be joining you this week, here at the NY bar in
Shinjuku.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Jt seems we stood and talked like this
before, we looked at each other in the same way thenr but I cant
remember where or when…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t want to go back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I know. But, it doesn’t last, you have to
go back sometime.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Why can’t it last?</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: I don’t know, it just doesn’t, reality
changes things….we can’t stay here forever, unless maybe we started a
Jazz band.</p>
<p><strong>singer</strong>: Somethings that happen for the first time,
seem to be happening again and so it seems we have met before, and
laughed before, and loved before, but who knows where or when…</p>
<p><strong>charlotte</strong>: 54?</p>
<p><strong>reception</strong>: Hello? Yes?</p>
