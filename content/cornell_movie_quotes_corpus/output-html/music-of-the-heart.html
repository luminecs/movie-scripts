<p><strong>shooting draft</strong>: January 25, 1999</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Wake up, Roberta!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Come on, Bert – get out of bed!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Please, Bert – you need to get out of
that bed.</p>
<p><strong>boy’s voice</strong>: Can you come out now, Mommy?
Please?</p>
<p><strong>boy #2</strong>: Mommy, Nick broke my crayon!</p>
<p><strong>boy #1</strong>: Well, Lexi hit me and he almost broke… he
almost broke my ear!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Hear that? Your boys need you.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: But I have no room for this!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I’m sorry, M’am. We have orders to deliver
these.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Watch it, you idiots! Be careful with
those!</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: Why so many?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mommy, which box has our toys?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Look, I know he’s there, so quit lying to
me!… Then check under Lana Holden – Mrs. Lana Holden… Fine. Just tell
Lieutenant Demetras that his wife called and –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Ma!</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: No. I want you to listen to me. You can’t
keep doing this to yourself – or to the boys. They need their mother
now. You’re a beautiful, talented woman and you have your whole life
ahead of you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: If I’m so beautiful and talented, why did
Charles leave me?</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: Because Charles is a big jerk. Now get
dressed.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You really think Charles is a jerk?</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: From the day you married him.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Why didn’t you say something?</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: Since when do you listen to me?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What am I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: First, you eat breakfast. Second, you go
out and get a job – any job. Your boys, god-bless-em, are good eaters –
but I can’t afford it.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Mama, he’s gonna get tired of her – you’ll
see.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: Well in the meantime, get a job.</p>
<p><strong>supervisor</strong>: Just wrap. You’re not Picasso.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Picasso would probably put the bows on
the back of the box.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Brian Turner?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hello, Roberta.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I thought you moved away.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I did. I’m in town for my Mom’s birthday.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No – that’s her gift.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh! Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: It looks very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Thank you. I heard you had a book
published. I didn’t read it but…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That’s O.K. My parents didn’t read it either.
It looks good on their coffee table, though.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: So what are you doing here? I thought you’d
be in Carnegie Hall by now.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: My college professors said it was too late
– I hadn’t had enough training to be a concert violinist. So I got a
teaching degree instead.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’ll bet you’re a great teacher.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I think I am. It’s just that… See, every
time I’d get started somewhere, Charles would be transferred… then I had
my kids and took time off to raise them… and then when I decided to
teach again, no one would hire me ’cause you can’t count on a navy wife
to stick around. I finally decided I’d start my own program – Charles
gave me the money and I bought fifty violins from this little Greek shop
– got started at a private school and then…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Your husband ran off with your best
friend.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: She wasn’t my “best” friend. She was a
friend. Charles is the last person you’d think would cheat on me – he
never broke a rule… I wake up one night – it’s like one in the morning –
and he’s not in bed. I go outside and our neighbor – this old Greek guy
– is sitting out there, smoking a cigar, so I ask if he’s seen my
husband. “He’s taking a walk with the other officer’s wife,” he says.
“He takes a walk every night with the other officer’s wife.”</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: God, these are cold.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: So you’re just gonna wrap presents and wait
for him to come back?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You sound like my mother.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That’s not very sexy.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Are you trying to be sexy or be my
friend?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: A little of both.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You know, I know this really cool lady who
runs this elementary school – I wrote a piece on her. It’s a public
school, but it’s alternative – she might be able to create some kind of
gig for you. Let me give her a call.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Great!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: If she hires you, though, you have to be
willing to relocate.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Welcome to East Harlem.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Aside from half a term in a private school –
in Greece – and a year teaching chorus in Hawaii – ten years ago – it
doesn’t look like you’ve had any other teaching experience.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, not traditional teaching experience.
I’ve been doing private lessons…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It’s not on there… I taught my sons.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’d like to help you, Mrs. Demetras. Brian
spoke highly of you and I told him I’d consider starting a violin class…
But without the proper qualifications, and without any experience in an
inner city school…</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m very sorry.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m sorry to interrupt, but I wanted you to
meet my sons – Nick, Lexi…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Roberta Guaspari-Demetras.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: This is Dennis Rausch, our music teacher and
program coordinator. Mrs. Demetras, didn’t I make things clear
yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: If I could just show you something – it’ll
only take a minute.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Are we having a talent show? I should have
brought my tap shoes.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Will you hire her now?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: How long have you boys been playing?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Since I was three.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Maybe since I was three and a half.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Your mom must be a good teacher.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: She’s O.K.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: If you could teach our students to play like
that, I’d be thrilled, but –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I can. Any child can learn the violin.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Assuming they had the discipline.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’ll teach them to have discipline.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: A lot of our parents are struggling to feed
their kids and pay the rent – they don’t have time to help them learn
violin.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: They don’t have to. If they can help, great
– but these kids will be committed. They’ll practice on their own,
they’ll help each other in the classroom –</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I think I know these students, Miss
Demetras. Their attention span doesn’t go past do-re-mi. Maybe on a good
day, I can get them to “fa.”</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’re underestimating them. They can play
as well as any other kids.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: That I’d like to see.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You will.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: For now I’ll put you down as a sub, but I
have to warn you – even if it works out, the Board may not let me create
a permanent position for you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That’s O.K. I’ll worry about that later.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Well, I’ve already planned out the whole
term, and I can tell you right now, there’s no room for this! Besides,
where you gonna find money for violins?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You need violins?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Please do not open the cases, O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Look, can everyone just settle down and
listen to me – please?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Keep them closed! Please.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Did you hear what I just said?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Put those down, please!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Don’t do that! Put the bows back in the
cases – right now!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Who’s plucking?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What have I been saying? Put that away!
Back in the case!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: O.K. Thank you. That’s much better. I’ll be
dividing you into five classes, but for today –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: O.K. – that’s it! You! Stand up!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You will be the first student who will NOT
be in my violin class. Out!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I said OUT!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Who else would like to be kicked out of my
class?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Are you raising your hand because you want
to be kicked out?</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: I don’t wanna learn no stupid violin. It’s
for wimps.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: I just know.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: De Sean.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, De Sean – you haven’t given me a good
enough reason, so you’re staying.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>naeem</strong>: Hey, I play pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: See how easy it is? Maybe in the spring, we
could have a big concert for your families and for the whole school.
What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>naeem</strong>: Naeem.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: If you listen to me and do exactly what I
say, you’re gonna sound beautiful at the concert and you’re gonna be so
proud of yourselves. Good, Naeem. Your hand’s staying soft. But if you
don’t listen to me, you’ll sound so bad that your own parents will feel
sick when they hear you. They might even throw up.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: It’s a toast. To Roberta, who’s made it
through her first week.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I don’t know, Brian. I’m hanging on by a
thread there. Out of fifty kids, maybe six are listening to me.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Look at the progress. Didn’t you say no one
was listening to you on Monday?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I really appreciate all you’ve done for us.
And I promise – this weekend I’ll start looking for a place.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: There’s no rush.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No, we’ve put you out enough. You’re
supposed to be writing, not babysitting for us. I’ve started your book.
It’s very powerful.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: So what made you choose migrant workers for
your next book? I mean, how do you know what to write about?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I follow my gut, pay attention to what I’m
being drawn to…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’ve been waiting to do that since
Mr. Baines’ orchestra class.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You didn’t even notice me!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Sure I did. You used to ignore me and it
drove me wild.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You had at least five different
girlfriends.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: It didn’t mean I had the one I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You’re not a navy wife anymore…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yes I am… legally.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: And is it a navy requirement that you dress
like it’s the 1950’s?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I do not!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Who did you vote for in the last
election?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What does that have to do with
anything?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I don’t know. Charles filled out my
absentee ballot.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Oh my God – it’s even worse than I thought!
Is this the same Roberta who got the orchestra to strike until they gave
us new uniforms?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That Roberta’s not around anymore.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I don’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Because?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: The boys –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: They’re sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I know, but… I’m still married.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: And what’s your husband doing right now?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh shit – the boys.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: They’re still sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Texas.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What’s in Texas?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Farm workers. I just got the call – it came
through – my research grant! It came through! Isn’t that great?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Today?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’ve got a few families lined up there, some
in California –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: How long will you be gone?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Two, three months.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I thought… I just thought you were gonna be
around. And then last night –</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Whoa. Roberta – last night was great but did
you think I was gonna marry you in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No! Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It’s just that… we just got here and we’re
barely… I don’t even know where to buy groceries.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You’re gonna be fine. You have a job, a place
to stay, your kids have a school to go to – and there’s a D’Agostino’s
around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: And what am I doing now?</p>
<p><strong>naeem/guadalupe</strong>: Rosining the bow.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Good. And what am I doing when I turn this
little screw? Everyone stop talking. Right now!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Naeem?</p>
<p><strong>naeem</strong>: Tightening the horse hair.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: And what do we call this?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: De Sean?</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What do we call this?</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: I wasn’t here.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yes you were but you weren’t paying
attention! Do you want people to think you’re stupid?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: All right, Naeem – tell them.</p>
<p><strong>naeem</strong>: It’s called the frog.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Anyone remember what this is?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Lucy! Do you like people snapping their
fingers when you’re talking?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What is this called?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: The jeri curl?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Excuse me – sorry to interrupt –</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: No talking!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m supposed to take kids out of Miss
Cooper’s classroom for my ten o’clock class – there’s nobody there.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Miss Cooper’s students have phys ed on
Tuesdays.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: But you scheduled them for violin.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You must have read the schedule wrong.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Well, I can’t solve this problem for you
right now. I’m trying to teach.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Can I bring a puppy for show and tell
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Honey, we don’t have a puppy.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Daddy said we could get one when we moved back
to America.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: How about your truck? I’ll bet you’re the
only one in school with a truck from Greece.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: When’s Daddy coming back?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, he’s still on his tour, so we’ll just
have to see but… It shouldn’t be too much longer.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Is he gonna live with us and Brian?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No, honey. We’re just staying at Brian’s
house for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Good night, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No! Leave it on.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Now take the right foot and put it on a
tile. Good. Now with the other foot take a tiny step forward and put it
on a line. Try to make a box with your feet –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Lucy! Would you like to leave the class
right now?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You should feel very strong – so strong and
balanced that if I wanted to knock you over I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You see? If you’re standing strong, I can’t
even push you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: De Sean! James! Quiet! Does anyone know
where Naeem is?</p>
<p><strong>tanisha</strong>: I saw him this morning but he’s not
here.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yes, I know he’s not here – that’s why I’m
asking.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: See how I pushed you? It means your feet
aren’t centered.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Can you bring over a chair? It’s probably
better for you to sit.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Where were you today, Naeem?</p>
<p><strong>naeem</strong>: I can’t be in violin class anymore.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>naeem</strong>: My mother won’t let me.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. adisa</strong>: My son’s got more important things to do
than learn dead white men’s music.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: They’re gonna learn “Twinkle Twinkle Little
Star”!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. adisa</strong>: How many Black classical composers can
you name? How many Black classical violinists do you know?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That doesn’t mean it’s the way it should
be. Naeem’s learning to play music – and that makes him feel good about
himself. Why should it matter who wrote it?</p>
<p><strong>naeem</strong>: Please, Mom? Can’t I be in the class?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. adisa</strong>: Look. I’ve seen this before. You white
women come up here and think you can rescue our poor inner city children
who never asked to be rescued in the first place. No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Brian Turner’s room, please.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: And which ocean is this?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Excuse me… I’m here for the violin
students.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Just a couple of minutes – I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: They’re having a lesson now.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: But this is when they have violin
class!</p>
<p><strong>alice</strong>: That’s not my problem.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I thought all the teachers agreed to
this.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: In theory. Adam! I want you in my office
right after lunch, you understand?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What’d I do?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Think about it! Whenever you pull kids out,
it’s a disruption, plus it’s extra work for the teacher ’cause they have
to fill the kids in on what they missed. Some teachers resent it.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, can’t you talk to them?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I took this off a second-grader this morning.
I’ll help you Roberta – but I can’t hold your hand here.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: A word of advice? When you’re picking up your
students, go to Alice’s classroom first.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: So pretend you’re driving a car and I’m the
policeman and I say STOP! Thumb up, fingers straight up, flat palm. Now
you be policemen, but turn your hand and make it say stop to
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Knock it off, De Sean! If you kids can’t
take this seriously, I don’t want you here. I’m teaching you a difficult
instrument because I respect you and have faith that you can learn it.
But none of that matters if you don’t have respect for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Now turn your wrist so it’s flat against
the fingerboard, and that’s how you’ll set up your hand…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Guadalupe! You’ve got the violin in the
wrong hand! How did that happen?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Hello, Bobbi.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’m back in the States. I’m at my
parents.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Are you still with her?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: We’ve missed you so much, Charles. The
boys… they can’t wait for you to come home… I know we’ll have a lot to
work out and it won’t be easy right away, but we’re gonna get through
this, you know? We’re a family and we belong together and –</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Bobbi – stop, O.K.? Just stop.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I want a divorce.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: But you said… you and Lana… you said it was
over.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: It is. It’s over between us too, Bobbi.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: He wouldn’t even talk about it! No
explanations, no discussion…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I can’t believe you were still holding out
hope. The guy hasn’t called you or the kids in three months – I thought
you’d moved on.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I never said that.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No? Maybe not with words.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You know what? I shouldn’t have called you.
This was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: No, no – I’m sorry. Look, I know it hurts,
but you’re gonna get through this, Roberta – you will.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m moving back to my Mom’s.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What? You’re gonna quit teaching in the
middle of the term?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I don’t fit in there – I’m not making any
progress with the kids…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What are you gonna tell Janet – your husband
left you and nothing else matters?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I don’t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: My mother gave it to me.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Why would she give you fifty dollars?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: To buy breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Do you know how hard your mother works? Do
you think it’s right for you steal from her?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I didn’t!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Well let’s go call her right now and ask
her.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I need to speak to you. It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: It’ll have to wait. Come on. In my
office.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Guadalupe? What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>guadalupe</strong>: I can’t get the stop sign.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Honey, your teacher’s probably looking for
you.</p>
<p><strong>guadalupe</strong>: I can’t come anymore. It’s too hard.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: The violin is hard for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>guadalupe</strong>: But everyone else is better than me. I’ll
always be slow.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Did you ever hear of Itzhak Perlman?</p>
<p><strong>guadalupe</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: He’s one of the greatest violinists in the
world, and he has problems with his legs too. He walks with two canes –
but he still makes the most beautiful music.</p>
<p><strong>guadalupe</strong>: And he sits down when he plays?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: He has to.</p>
<p><strong>guadalupe</strong>: He was your student?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No. But if he was, I’d tell him the same
thing I’m telling you. You shouldn’t quit something just because it’s
hard.</p>
<p><strong>guadalupe</strong>: But I can’t stand strong.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Standing strong doesn’t only mean using
your legs. You can stand strong on the inside too. Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You wanted to speak to me?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh. Umm – that’s O.K. It’s taken care
of.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Is just for you and your boys?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: No husband? No boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Look what I made you, Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That is so beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Whatsa matter – you got cooties?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Apparently.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: I’ll take my chances. Isabel Vasquez. Second
grade.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Roberta Demetras. I’m the –</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Violin teacher. I know.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Is it my imagination, or does everyone hate
me?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: It’s hard to fit in when you’re doing a
special program. People figure you’re not gonna be here very long, so
why make the effort? It may take a while for folks to warm up, but
nobody hates you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What about Alice Crowley?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: she thinks the violin’s a waste – she’s a
bitch.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: And then there’s Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: The Music Man. You’ve had the bodacity to
threaten his private little empire – not to mention the fact that you
messed up his sacred scheduling chart.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: How come you’re being nice to me?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Ulterior motives. I want my daughter in your
class next year.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: If I’m here next year.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: You will be.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: In Greece, we could see the ocean.
Remember?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I remember. And the fishing boats…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And the octopuses.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is Daddy coming here soon?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, that’s something I’ve been wanting to
talk to you about. Daddy’s not gonna live with us anymore. You and Lexi
will have special times when you stay with him, like at Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Can you tell the birthday story?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Don’t you want to talk about what I told
you?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I want to hear the birthday story.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It was the day of Grandpa’s birthday, and I
was sad because he had died a few months back.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: But you knew I’d be born that day.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: So I packed a bag and got all ready –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: And Daddy laughed.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I said, “It’s my father’s birthday, and the
baby’s gonna be born today.”</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: He didn’t believe you. But I was born. The
same day as Grandpa.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It was a happy day.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Was Daddy happy too?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Of course he was.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Then why is he leaving me?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: He’s not leaving you, Nick. He loves you
and Lexi very much.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Then why can’t he live here?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It’s very hard to explain… Sometimes things
happen between grown-ups… and they just can’t be together.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Slow bows! Slow bows! Don’t squeeze! Stop!
Everybody stop! How much did you practice this week?</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: My asthma – it was very bad and I had to go
to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Again? You told me you went to the hospital
last week.</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: Oh yeah. Maybe it was last week.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Lucy – you sounded the worst of all. Have
you practiced?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Why not? You can’t be in this class if you
don’t practice!</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: My grandma got mugged.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh. I’m sorry. Is she O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: She died.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m really sorry, Lucy. Just do the best
you can.</p>
<p><strong>naeem</strong>: Hi, Roberta.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Hi, Naeem. Can I talk to your mom for a
minute?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Look, I didn’t come up here to rescue
anybody. I’m a single mother and I needed a job. And I know you think
you’re protecting your son, but you’re not. I mean, what if Arthur
Ashe’s mother had stopped him from playing tennis because it’s a “white
man’s game”? The important thing is that when Naeem plays music, his
whole face lights up. You should see him.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: We all have to take turns cleaning up,
O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: First finger on the E! Three – two – one –
open! Wrong string, Becky! We’ve done this fourteen times! And look at
your nails! You’re supposed to cut them for violin class! O.K, everybody
stop! It sounds horrible! I can’t believe how bad it sounds!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Is this an important question, Tanisha?</p>
<p><strong>tanisha</strong>: Do you have two of those skirts?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tanisha</strong>: You wore a skirt just like it on
Monday.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You know, Tanisha – I don’t think that’s
such an important question. O.K. Let’s try –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. adisa</strong>: Naeem and I were wondering if he could
still be in the class.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’d love that. You’ll have a lot of
catching up to do. You think you can work that hard?</p>
<p><strong>naeem</strong>: Yeah, I can.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Maybe we can also arrange some private
lessons at my house.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. adisa</strong>: I wouldn’t have the money for that.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That’s O.K. Why don’t you go grab one of my
spare violins?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Let’s try it again.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What are you playing?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Twinkle.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Everyone stop! Let me hear.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Did someone teach you that?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: No. I made it up.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That’s really great, Lucy. I’m proud of
you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: All of you – try it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lamb</strong>: You’re shouting at them. All the
time.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Not all the time. But if they don’t listen
–</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lamb</strong>: Didn’t you tell them that they were
making their parents sick?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That wasn’t exactly what I said –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lamb</strong>: I’m raising Becky in a supportive
atmosphere. I don’t send her to school to be abused.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m just trying to discipline them. If
they’re gonna learn an instrument, they need to take it seriously –</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I think what Mrs. Lamb is trying to say,
Roberta, is that you’re a little too harsh. I’m sure you might be able
to soften some of your comments to the children?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, that was… that was pretty good… that
wasn’t too bad…</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: It wasn’t? I thought we stunk.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I wouldn’t put it that way… You all just
need to practice a bit more. James, have you practiced this week?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Can you please try a little harder for next
week?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Good. Just do the best you can.</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: Why you acting like that?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Don’t you want a nice teacher?</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: I already got nice teachers. You added some
variety.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Yeah. We like you better the way you used to
be.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh. What about you, Becky?</p>
<p><strong>becky</strong>: Yeah. This is even worse. You’re acting weird
now.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, then – I take it back. You all
stunk.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: But don’t tell your parents I said so!</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Can’t you come with us? Please?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Honey, I told you. This is Daddy’s special
time with you.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: I’ll take good care of them.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Santa Claus.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: O.K., enough goofing off – back to
work.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You trying to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: I was the only person in the whole coffee
shop not speaking Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: You hear that? Gunshots! How you gonna live
here by yourself? Boys, come eat!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I work in this neighborhood, Mama. I want
to live here.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Lawrence.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: You hungry, Lawrence?</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: Why did you let her buy this house?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Hey, your daughter does what she wants – or
haven’t you noticed?</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: I’ve noticed.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: I still don’t understand the rush.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Having my own place will make me feel like
I’m really starting my life again.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: But if you invested your divorce
settlement, you could buy something nice someday. It’s bad enough that
you’ve been renting in this neighborhood, but to lock yourself into a
mortgage –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Mama, please. Just stop!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Don’t worry, O.K.? Besides, if things keep
going well, I’m sure eventually Brian will move in with us.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: How much do you know about this man?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Brian’s a good person, he’s helped me a
lot, he’s great with the boys – since he got back to town, it’s been
really sweet.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: And how long has he been back?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Two months.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: That’s not very long. Don’t make the same
mistake twice, Bert. You barely knew Charles when you married him.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I don’t get it – you’re ragging on me about
buying the house – I would think you’d want Brian to live with me.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: Not if he’s the wrong person.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Get ready, now – we’re coming up to the
fermata…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Hold… Hold… Don’t anybody move. Now at the
Spring Concert, the audience is gonna be dying for that next note – but
we’ll make them wait. As a matter of fact, I think I’ll go grab a cup of
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, O.K. But you have to promise you’ll
all start together.</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: Man. We’ll never get that right.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That’s not a very nice thing to say about
your classmates. How many people think they can get it right by the
concert?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Did you just laugh?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s just…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Why do people feel like the minute
something’s going great, they gotta name it? Once you name something,
you snuff the life out of it.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Jesus, Brian. Do you still get away with
that crap? It’s not the Sixties anymore.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well, maybe if you’d actually gone through
the Sixties, you’d know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Fine! We won’t name it, we won’t talk about
it, we’ll act like we have no feelings for each other whatsoever!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m being an asshole. You can say
you love me if you want.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Forget it. I changed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: How’s it coming, Ernie?</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Well, if I could just remember what I did
here yesterday, I’d be moving a whole lot faster. You look real pretty
today, honey.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You’re crazy. Why did you hire him?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: He needed a job. Besides, he’s wired all of
East Harlem.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: When? Fifty years ago?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Why is there wallpaper on it?</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: That’s how it comes.</p>
<p><strong>ernie</strong>: Yep, that’s how it comes now.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Sheetrock.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You’ve gotta be kidding. Those ex- cons you
hired ripped this off – and you too!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Look – this house is taking every penny of
my settlement. I can’t afford fancy union workers!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Fine. Do it your way.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’m giving him a two-day suspension – but
next time he’ll be expelled.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: There won’t be a next time – I promise.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Have you noticed your son lately? He’s tied
up in knots and he needs help.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Janet, kids fight. You’re making too much
of this.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: He was choking the kid. Nick’s in trouble,
Roberta. You need to deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Keep playing, guys.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You can watch when we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s my house! They don’t live here – I
do!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Nick honey – the kids are real nervous
about the Spring concert. You could probably give them some
pointers.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t feel like it.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I said no.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Good catch Nick!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Uh-oh. You know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t! Don’t throw me in!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Whatsa matter? Afraid of a little water? The
ducks aren’t afraid! Are you a chicken or a duck?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t! Don’t throw me!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Looks like you got yourself a chicken,
Roberta!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not a chicken!</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Well then you must be a duck!</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Throw me in the water, Brian! Do it to me!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You seem to be the only one who can get
Nick to laugh these days.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: He misses his dad. I’m just a surrogate.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No – I think Nick really likes you. You
know… we’re all hoping you’ll move into the new house with us.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Whoa. Can we just slow down here a minute?
It’s too much like getting married.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What’s so bad about that?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That kind of commitment just isn’t realistic.
I mean, how can we know that you and I will even be able to stand each
other in five years?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, we don’t. But if two people care
about each other, they take a chance.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: And look what happened to you and
Charles.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m not talking about Charles. I’m talking
about us.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Look, Roberta. Marriage is based on a belief
that one person can completely meet another person’s needs. I just don’t
buy that.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What are you saying? If there’s some need
you have that I don’t meet, you’d go and get it “met” by someone
else?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I’m saying that it’s the 80’s and it’s a
fantasy to think of marriage lasting these days. One out of two
marriages ends in divorce!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You didn’t answer my question. If I don’t
meet all your needs, and we’re in a committed relationship – forget
marriage for a minute; I’m just talking about a relationship – would you
go to someone else?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: In theory, yes.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: In theory.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Roberta, we’ve got something good right now –
that’s the important thing. Let’s just keep it that way,</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why can’t he?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: He just can’t, O.K.? Brian’s at his house
tonight, and we’re at ours.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Well then I wanna go to his house.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Enough, Nick. Now why don’t you and your
brother practice while I make dinner.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I don’t feel like practicing.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well do it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I wanna go to Brian’s!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Stop whining, and get your violin.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: The problem with you is you’re mean to
everybody and then they don’t want to be with you!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’ve heard just about enough from you,
young man. Now set your violin up properly and start practicing.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I hate the violin!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You pick that violin up right now and don’t
you ever ever –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s all your fault! You made Daddy leave and
you’re gonna make Brian leave too! You’re gonna be all alone and I’ll
have to take care of you!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Nick – you don’t have to take care of
me.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Then who’s going to?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’ll take care of myself – and I’ll take
care of you and Lexi. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You didn’t try hard enough. You made Daddy
leave us.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That’s not true. I begged him not to leave,
but he didn’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Your father met someone he liked more than
Mommy, and then –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Lana. Remember our friends Lana and
Tom?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Is he gonna marry her now?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No, but he’s not coming back… to me.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’ll take care of you, Nick. You too, Lexi.
I promise. I’m not going anywhere. We’re still a family.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What color is this?</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: White.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I told you Eggshell.</p>
<p><strong>painter</strong>: Eggshells are white.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: You’re an idiot! I told you – you can’t be
your own contractor.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’re right. I’m an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Wake up, Ernie.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: That’s more like it.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’re fired too.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No, Brian. I mean it. I need to be with a
man who can make a commitment to me. I need that, and my sons need that.
So can you?</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Roberta –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s the one Lucy wrote!</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: C’mon everybody, settle down – Janet wants
to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Today’s a very special day because we’re
starting the tenth year of the East Harlem Violin Program. This is a
wonderful opportunity for you, so I want you to talk to your parents
about whether you’d like to try this.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: My daughter took violin with Roberta when
she was your age, and now she’s in high school and she still talks about
how much she loved it.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Janet and I started this program because we
knew how much you kids could benefit from it.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You should know, however, that the violin is
a difficult instrument.</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: Who’s that lady in the back?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: That’s Dorothea Van Hauften –</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: Say what? What kinda name is that?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Justin – sshh!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: – and she’s taking pictures of Roberta’s
classes for a magazine article about music education.</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: I wanna be in the magazine!</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: First things first, Justin. Roberta’s gonna
explain to you about the “lottery.”</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I used to just teach fifty kids at this
school. But now I teach a hundred and fifty kids at three East Harlem
schools and there’s so many children who want to take violin classes
that we have to have a lottery.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Can I be in the class?</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Roberta’s explaining that. Just listen.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: After your parents sign your permission
slips, I’m gonna put them in a sack, and I’ll pick fifty names from each
school.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: So everyone bring in your slips by Friday,
and I’ll come back and tell you who’s in violin class.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Remember, she’s just picking names from a
hat. It doesn’t mean that anyone’s better than anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: I really really hope that I get in the
class.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I hope so too.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How come you guys don’t play the violin?</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Well, picture her being your teacher and your
mother.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Hi Rachel. Be right with you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’re gonna practice upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: No. I’m done.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Already? You’ve barely practiced.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What – are you timing me with a stop watch?
Why don’t you pick on Lexi for a change?</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: ’Cause I’m perfect.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Have a good lesson.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: I’ll be back in a couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Can I try your bike?</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: I’m gonna be leaving pretty soon.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Just wanna take it for a spin.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: C’mon, Henry – he don’t want to loan you
his bike.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I didn’t hear him say that. Is that true? Did
you say that?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Vibrato… don’t wiggle your wrist.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dang! I can’t get that right.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You almost have it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Almost isn’t good enough.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Did I turn you into such a
perfectionist?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No. I came that way.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Just as long as you get it right for your
Julliard audition.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’ve recommended you for a gifted kids
scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Where’s the bike?</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Mom, please. Don’t do this to me!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: C’mon, Mom – why don’t you let me handle
this?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Are we getting closer, Lawrence?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: It’s the next block up.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: You don’t have to do this. I’ll pay you
back.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: How? It took me six months to save up for
it.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’ll help him, O.K.? We’ll both pay you
back.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Or we’ll ask Dad – he’ll help us out.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: O.K., slow down. It’s the second one on
the right.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: C’mon Mom, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Lock the doors.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: I’m dead. She’s gonna get me killed.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m coming with you!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No. Get back in the car and stay with the
boys.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Don’t take the stairs!</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m a school teacher. Henry has taken my
son’s bicycle and I want it back.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Henry’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well you tell Henry that if he returns the
bike, I won’t have to notify the police – or his school principal.
Although since I am a teacher, it would be very easy for me to do
that.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: He’s not home. He doesn’t get home till
late.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: How late?</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Not till after ten.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’ll be on the steps of CPE 1 at 11 P.M.
I’ll be waiting for him.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: You’re crazy. He’s not gonna show.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You think he actually cares that you’re a
teacher? You think he even goes to school?</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: C’mon, Mom – let’s just go.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It’s only five after eleven.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I was just borrowing it.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Shandra Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Justin Brady.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Vanessa Klein.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: O.K. One more name…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Leonard Hood.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: It’s too hard! I don’t wanna do it!</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Don’t you even wanna try, Leonard?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I don’t want to!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, O.K. then. I’ll pick someone else.
Ramon Olivas.</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: This is to inform you that your child, Ramon
Olivas, has been chosen by lottery to be in the violin program.</p>
<p><strong>concepcion</strong>: You happy?</p>
<p><strong>concepcion</strong>: I think you’re happy.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Does that really work?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No. But I keep trying. And maybe someday
the school will give me a parking space!</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: Wait –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: God, these are great.</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: Those copies are for you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Thank you. Can I… pay for you them?</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: Don’t be silly. Besides – you’ll need your
money for parking tickets.</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: What you’re doing for these children is
wonderful. My husband’s a violinist – he was quite impressed when I told
him about you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: Arnold Steinhardt.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Of the Guarneri String Quartet?</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: Stay in touch. Let us know when the kids
have a concert.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t be late for violin class! I hear the
teacher’s really mean.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Amanda, what did I tell you about wearing
cowboy boots to violin class? They’re too slippery!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Relax your two, Simon…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Your stop sign has to be up, Kenny!
Stephanie, it doesn’t look like you ever had a lesson with me!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Where’s your violin, Carlos?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: It’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What, is it walking here by itself?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Your buddies giving you a hard time?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Look, it’s just not cool. You wouldn’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Hey, you want your sister to carry your
violin, that’s fine. But is she practicing for you too? Because lately,
that’s how it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I’ve been busy! I’ve been –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m not interested! Just get here on time,
and commit to this class or I don’t want you in here, you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’re a good violinist, Carlos – and it’s
definitely not “cool” to waste your own talent.</p>
<p><strong>manuelo</strong>: Why didn’t you show it to me?</p>
<p><strong>concepcion</strong>: It just needed one parent’s
signature.</p>
<p><strong>manuelo</strong>: Well, I’m his parent and I don’t give
permission! He should be playing baseball, not the violin!</p>
<p><strong>concepcion</strong>: It makes him happy.</p>
<p><strong>boy #1</strong>: Ooh, check out little Miss Violinhead.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: She carry that violin with her all the time
’cause she think she special.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I am special.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: So I heard from Julliard.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: They said yes!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: So when you take the violins home, tape
your music to the wall directly in front of your nose so you can play
with perfect posture. Your parents are gonna be so excited to hear you
play!</p>
<p><strong>pedro</strong>: Ramon! How many cats you killing in
there?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: More bow! To the frog! Myesha, your stop
sign line should be touching. Don’t let it wiggle! You’re on the wrong
string, Justin! And look at your feet!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Where’s your violin?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Goodbye! And you may be dropped.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Look at those nails, Rosario!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I see you over there, Myesha.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’re doing much better.</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: Drop dead, Justin!</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: It was a accident!</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: Was not!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Ramon, I don’t like that kind of talk.
Justin, pick up his stand, now! Our spring concert is in three weeks and
you might not be in it. Is that what you want?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Mr. Klein? I’m gonna have to drop Vanessa
from the class if she keeps forgetting her violin.</p>
<p><strong>mr. klein</strong>: She’s going back and forth between
houses. My wife and I split up.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Vanessa, maybe you could write down for
your Mom and Dad which days are violin days.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: The tape doesn’t stick.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: I taped the music to the wall at my Mom’s
house and then I took it to my Dad’s house and it doesn’t stick
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well you know what? That’s an easy problem
to solve.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Now you have two, O.K.? One for each
house.</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: You wanna hear my new song, Papa?</p>
<p><strong>manuelo</strong>: Not right now.</p>
<p><strong>concepcion</strong>: We made mistakes with Pedro and Ernesto
and we can’t fix them now, but Ramon – he works so hard. The violin
makes him want to be good at everything.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: You go to heaven… You go to hell… You go to
hell… heaven…</p>
<p><strong>toussaint</strong>: My grandpa died and my uncle, so that
makes six.</p>
<p><strong>shandra</strong>: I know more than that. At least seven
people… maybe even nine.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I know that you’ve all heard the bad news
about Justin.</p>
<p><strong>myesha</strong>: I didn’t hear.</p>
<p><strong>toussaint</strong>: There was a drive-by shooting by his
house and he got shot on accident and he died.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Does anyone want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: I think we should just play violin.</p>
<p><strong>concepcion</strong>: Roberta! Come in.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I came by to check on Ramon.</p>
<p><strong>concepcion</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Didn’t he tell you what happened at
school?</p>
<p><strong>concepcion</strong>: Roberta wants to talk to you, O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: Did that sound O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yeah, it did.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’ve been thinking about Justin. Remember
how mad I got the last time I saw him?</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: Yeah. You got very strict with him.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It wasn’t always so easy to be nice to him,
you know?</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: You think Justin’s in heaven or hell?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: I told him to drop dead.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Justin didn’t die because of what you said.
I promise.</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I don’t think you’re that powerful, do you?
I mean, if you had such powers, just imagine what kind of violin player
you’d be by now!</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: Yeah. I’d be better than you!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It’s O.K. to cry, you know.</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: Not for a man.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: My boys still cry and they’re big, strong
young men now. I bet Justin’s daddy cried.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Nick, Lexi! Get down here right now!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: We were just trying to help!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: This is humiliating!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Mom, no one knows it’s you! I mean, you don’t
even have to read them if you don’t want to. Although obviously, a lot
of guys are interested in dating you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No. A lot of guys are interested in dating
you and Lexi. What did you say about me, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: “Beautiful musician, late 40’s, tired of
playing solo –</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: – seeks a healthy, stable, attractive man
who’s not afraid of a duet with a strong, independent woman.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: My violin playing will feed your soul…</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: …And my lasagna will be music to your
palate.”</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Did you catch all the music metaphors?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Don’t you think it’s a little weird that
you’re trying to get your mother a date?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Don’t you think it’s a little weird that
you’re not even interested in dating?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Boys, look. Number one – even if I wanted
to date, I don’t have time. And number two – I’ve got my teaching, I’ve
got you guys – that’s all I need.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: I really thought she’d like the music
metaphors.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I think you’re flat, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: I’m not flat.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: The B sounded flat.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Just play the violin, Mom. I’ll take care of
the cello.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: You nervous, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Hi. I’m Dan Paxton.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Wow. An honest woman.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Honest?</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Your ad. When you said you were beautiful, you
were telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Make sure you’re home by midnight, young
lady.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Ten bucks he tries to kiss her.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: That’s a no-brainer. Of course he’ll try. The
real question is whether she’ll let him.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: O.K. – ten bucks she lets him.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re on.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I had a lot of fun tonight.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yeah, I did too.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I have a confession – I’ve never answered an ad
before. I did it on a dare.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, I have a confession – my boys placed
the ad behind my back.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Look, Dan – I went along with this ’cause
it’s been a while. Quite a while… And I had a very nice time… but I’m
not sure if I’m ready to get involved with anyone right now.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Does this mean I don’t get any lasagna?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Why are you guys still up?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Why? Is it late?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Good try, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: So how was it?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well… he’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: “Nice”? As in “let’s just be friends”
nice?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I don’t know yet. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There’s still a lot more letters.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Good night, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Hey, Mom – can you loan me ten dollars?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Guys, I’m so sorry – I got stuck over at
CPE 2…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What’s going on? Where are all your
violins?</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: We heard you got fired.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Why don’t you come in my office?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It’s true? You’re firing me?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: It’s not me, Roberta. The Board of Ed. cut
the budget, the District had to comply, and as of the end of this term,
the violin program has been… excessed.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Excessed. They specifically said that my
violin program has to go.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: They’ve slashed the budget – music and art
programs got hit the worst.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What about Dennis’ classes?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: I’m tenured, Roberta.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: When was this decided?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Things happened very quickly… I wanted to
tell you myself –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I just… I can’t even believe this is
happening!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Why not? You’re a sub. Your position has
never been permanent.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Shut up, Dennis! You’re not helping! Come
into my office, please.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: There’s gotta be a way to fight this!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Fight it with what? I don’t have any other
extra programs to give them instead.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh, I see. So after ten years, after
fourteen hundred children have learned to play the violin, this is just
an “extra program.”</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You know I don’t feel that way and you know
damn well I’ve been standing by you all these years! You think I haven’t
noticed what you’ve done for these kids?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Then do something!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’ve been on this phone for the past three
days trying to “do something” – the District office can’t even stand the
sound of my voice. Believe me, there are some people around here I’d
much rather get rid of. But as far as the Board’s concerned, violin
classes are not a priority.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I don’t have the power here, Roberta. I’m so
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: sitting at the kitchen table with a glass
of wine, her face ashen.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m a good teacher. I’ve worked so hard to
give these kids something to be proud of.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: I’m so sorry, Mom. I can’t believe they did
this to you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It’s like when my father got killed. For
twenty years, he followed every safety rule the factory had, and then
someone else flips the wrong switch… It’s not fair. You do everything
right and then…</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: It’s the wrong analogy. You couldn’t do
anything about Grandpa’s death. It was irreversible. This isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Tell that to the Board of Education.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Let me ask you something. Why did you risk
your life for a bicycle?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I did not risk my life.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Of course you did! That building? Threatening
Henry? And for what – two hundred dollars?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No. Not for that.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Then why?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: When someone steals something that belongs
to my kids, I’m not gonna sit back and let that happen!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Guys – you need to think about this. If I
try to fight this – with no salary coming in – I could lose the house,
screw up your college plans… It would be a lot safer to just go out
tomorrow and get a job in a private school.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Yeah, but is that where you really want to
be?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: The beautiful concert that you just heard
could be the last concert of the East Harlem Violin Program. The Board
of Education and the District Superintendent don’t think that music is
important for our children. But they’re wrong – and they’re in for a
fight.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Someone’s early.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Hello, Assunta. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: I’d be a lot better if my daughter had a
job next year.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Ma!</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I would too.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Sorry I’m early, but I figured we’d need time
to set up.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Mama, why don’t you take Allegra out for a
walk?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You are having a meeting here tonight, right?
Parents and teachers?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, yes, but …</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Take it from me. If you want to get parents
to help you with something, you have to feed them.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You have a cutting board for these?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: And if you think parents are bad, teachers
are even worse, no offense. If you don’t feed them, you never get
anything extra out of them. That’s why I got this.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Entenmann’s gets them every time.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: What? Don’t tell me you expected me to bring
something homemade.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, no… I –</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Good. Because take it from me – my own family
begs me to stay out of the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What I didn’t expect was for you to be
here.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Why not? We’ve gotta figure out a way to
fight this. After ten years, Roberta, I can’t imagine walking through
those hallways and not hearing that off-key, screechy, scratchy,
nails-on-the- blackboard violin music.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: What do you think? Cut it into slices now, or
leave it whole?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Let’s cut it now. It’ll be less messy.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: Don’t they realize how much this program
helps the kids?</p>
<p><strong>mr. adams</strong>: Simon’s our third child to study with
Roberta. James is pre-med, April’s valedictorian – now that says
something!</p>
<p><strong>mr. klein</strong>: I think we should inundate the Board and
the District with letters.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: You’re wasting your time. The Board and the
District are not gonna pay for this program, no matter how many letters
they get.</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: What if we raise the money ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I can’t see how they’d object to that.</p>
<p><strong>concepcion</strong>: Well once that newspaper article comes
out, that should help bring in money.</p>
<p><strong>beverly</strong>: Yeah, but what if it doesn’t? For all we
know, it’s gonna be buried on the back page. Besides, who says anyone’s
gonna give a damn about our kids?</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: What if you do a benefit concert? We can
raise a batch of money from ticket sales, and then the concert itself
could be great publicity. There’s word of mouth… you could get
reviewed…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It better be a good concert!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: We have to offer something more than me and
the kids. Do you think maybe your husband would perform with us?</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: I’m sure I could persuade him with a
little pillow talk. And maybe he can get another violinist too – Itzhak
Perlman, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That would be fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: We could rent a place like the 92nd Street
Y – it’s perfect for this. It seats about nine hundred people and if we
charge between fifty and a hundred a ticket –</p>
<p><strong>isabel</strong>: We could probably raise enough to reinstate
your program for a year.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Sounds like a plan.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It better be a good concert.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Take your pick.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Kids, listen to me – it’s really important
that you don’t look at the camera and you try to act as natural as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Who authorized this?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Janet.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Well Janet’s not here today and I want these
people out of here.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Turn that off, you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Why are you doing this? We’re not bothering
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You’re disrupting school and I want them out
of here – now.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You still don’t get it, do you? I don’t
care if you hate me, Dennis – that’s your business. But think about the
students for once. Every time you interfere, you’re not hurting me –
you’re hurting them.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Get these people out of here or I’m calling
the police.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Go right ahead, call them. That’ll look
real good on the eleven o’clock news.</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: I don’t hear no sirens.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m from a blue collar family, and if it
weren’t for the lessons I got in public school, I never would have
learned the violin.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: How does it make you feel to lose your
violin program?</p>
<p><strong>shandra</strong>: It makes us sad!</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: Yeah, like we’re never gonna have no more
violin lessons –</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: And it’s bad because… because we love
violin class.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yes, I’ve gotten offers from two private
schools, but this is where I want to be.</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: Arnold, these kids need help.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Didn’t we send them a donation?</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: They need something bigger. And you can’t
just write a check – you have to get involved.</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Involved how?</p>
<p><strong>arnold</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Listen up, everyone! Quiet down!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You are my very best beginner and advanced
violin students and I’ve chosen you to play in Fiddlefest because I
trust that you can handle the pressure. It’s gonna be a lot of work – a
lot. Right now, we’ve sold some tickets, but I’m not gonna be back here
in the fall if the audience storms out of their seats, demanding a
refund!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Rachel’s gonna be my lieutenant and I
expect you to listen to her.</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: Bach’s “Minuet One”?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: People are gonna be paying good money for
this concert – we’re not just gonna play “Twinkle.” I’m passing out a
contract that you and your parents need to sign.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Every Saturday and Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Plus night time rehearsals during the week.
There’s only six weeks till the concert, so classes in school won’t be
enough.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Come to think of it, we’ll probably also
need to meet before school.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’ve heard of Navy Seal Training? Well,
this is gonna be Roberta String Training.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh my god! Naeem! De Sean! Guadalupe!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Lucy? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Kids, these are four of my very first
violin students and I’ve asked them to play in the concert with us. I
was just telling them how hard they’re gonna have to work.</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: Take it from me – this lady don’t lie.
Y’all are gonna work your butts off.</p>
<p><strong>teammate #1</strong>: Hey Carlos! Where ya goin’? We got a
game, remember?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Yeah, I know, but… I can’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>teammate #1</strong>: What you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I just can’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>teammate #2</strong>: You got a date with the violin
teacher?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Yeah. I do.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Frog! Frog! I need more accents on the down
beat! More bow! More!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Stop! Stop! You sound horrible! Isn’t
anyone practicing?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: How can we practice? We’re rehearsing all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You think this is funny, Stephanie? You
think the four hundred people who’ve bought tickets so far will think
it’s funny too? You think Itzhak Perlman will think it’s funny that he’s
donating his time and you’re all gonna stink?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Am I boring you, Vanessa?</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: No. It’s 7:30 in the morning. I’m just
tired.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: There’s no time to be tired. Let’s try it
again.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I must have been crazy to agree to this.
They’re never gonna be ready. And you should hear the Bach Double! A
disaster. So the good news is tickets are selling like hot cakes, but
the bad news is that the kids sound like shit.</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: There’s more bad news… We’ve lost the
Y.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: They had a flood – a water heater burst…
The concert hall was damaged and they’ve cancelled all events.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Until when?</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: “Until further notice.”</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: This can’t happen! We’ve sold tickets!
We’ve done publicity! The concert’s in three weeks!</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: I’ve been on the phone all morning calling
other theaters. Nothing’s available.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Just keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Stop! Someone’s playing the wrong notes!
And you shouldn’t need your music anymore! Except for the Bach Double,
everything has to be memorized by next rehearsal!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: And you sound like you’re sleepwalking.
Your heart’s not even in it.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: Maybe ’cause we don’t have a place for the
concert.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Well, you’re right. This might all be for
nothing. So we can either keep on rehearsing in case we find a place –
or we can just… give up.</p>
<p><strong>de sean</strong>: Am I hearing right? Did you use the words
“give up”? Let’s take a vote. How many of you want to give up?</p>
<p><strong>guadalupe</strong>: See? You taught us well.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What about in the Bronx?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: There’s nothing. Why don’t you just do it in
one of the schools? It’ll be a lot smaller but –</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: We won’t make enough money.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: What about postponing it?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Itzhak and Arnold are booked all
summer.</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: It’s Dorothea.</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: I have good news – really good news.
Arnold got a call from his friend Wally Scheur who heard about us losing
the Y and wanted to see how he could help – and then Wally had this
brilliant idea and called his friend Isaac Stern and it’s all arranged!
We have a new place for Fiddlefest!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>dorothea</strong>: Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Carnegie Hall?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Incredible sound in this room, no?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh my god – Isaac Stern.</p>
<p><strong>isaac stern</strong>: You must be Roberta.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Thank you so much for helping us.</p>
<p><strong>isaac stern</strong>: Would you believe in 1960, they tried
to tear this place down? They wanted to replace it with a bright red
skyscraper – we called it “the red terror.”</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>isaac stern</strong>: We had to fight like hell, but with a
lot of help, we saved Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p><strong>isaac stern</strong>: If it’s all right with you, I’d like to
play in your concert. Maybe bring a couple of friends…</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yes, of course! That would be great!</p>
<p><strong>isaac stern</strong>: Don’t give up.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I just don’t see how I’m gonna do this.
It’s huge. It’s gigantic! It’s Carnegie Hall! And listen to this: now
Isaac Stern wants to play with us – Diane Monroe, Michael Tree – there’s
other people calling –</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: That’s fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Fantastic? I’ll never get the kids up to
speed in time, I’ll never get myself up to speed. I’m gonna be playing
side by side with the world’s greatest violinists.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: And “the world’s greatest violinists” are
playing side by side with you because they want to help you win this
fight.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Yes, but… you don’t understand. Maybe
there’s a good reason why I never made it as a violinist – maybe I just
can’t cut it. I keep blaming it on not having enough early training, but
if I were talented, if I had a gift –</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: But you do have a gift. You’re gonna put thirty
East Harlem kids on stage at Carnegie Hall not because they’re
prodigies, but because you got them to stick with something that’s hard
as hell and to strive for excellence – which, by the way, I certainly
wasn’t striving for when I was their age. Not to mention the other ten
years’ worth of students whose lives were changed because of you. That’s
your talent, Roberta.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I know. And by the way, I happen to think
you’re a pretty good violinist too.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You’ve barely heard me play.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I’ve heard enough to know you’re gonna do just
fine.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Besides, no one’s gonna be paying attention to
your playing anyway.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Teacher’s late. I think she should be
dropped, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ramon</strong>: Yeah. I don’t think we should let her play in
Fiddlefest!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: More bow! To the frog! You sound terrible! I
can’t believe how terrible you sound!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You’re gonna make everyone in Carnegie Hall
sick to their stomachs! That’s right, they’re gonna pay a thousand
dollars a ticket and you’re gonna make them throw up on their gowns and
tuxedos!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: If you’re gonna imitate me, do it right.
Shoulders back. Violin higher. Check your feet. There. G’head, Carlos.
Continue.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: No, that’s O.K. You can take it from
here.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: He’s right, by the way. You do sound
terrible, and you are gonna make everyone in Carnegie Hall sick to their
stomachs.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I’ll be right in. Start on Minuet One.
What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We’re moving away.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What? Where are you moving?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s a secret… My father… he’s been hurting
my mom… We have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Has he been hurting you too?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m sorry about Julliard… and the
concert.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Keep it. Take it with you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No… I don’t want to play anymore.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: What?! You can’t give up violin, Rachel –
it’s a part of you. A very important part.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Please honey. Just take it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: No, no, no! Accent the up bow after the
slurred notes and then it’ll get you off of those slurred notes! You
Double Concerto kids need to be working harder! This is the grand finale
of the concert! You’re each gonna be sharing a music stand with one of
the world’s greatest violinists!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I think we should forget the Bach Double.
And you guys are never gonna get Minuet One. I think we should drop that
too.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: No! We can do it, Roberta!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: And we’ll get the Bach Double. We will.</p>
<p><strong>naeem</strong>: It’s gonna be O.K., Roberta.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>o.k…</strong>: It’s gonna be O.K.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Nick – did you feed Allegra?</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Yes, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Lexi, can you make sure the charts are
still in my bag?</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: I already checked, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Check again, please. And look for my repair
kit too.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: Bert, which earrings you want?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Nick? Get two more violins.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’ve already got two – how many emergencies
can there be?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Get three more. And make sure a couple of
them are half-size.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Lexi – can you call about the car
again?</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: Mom, they’re not gonna forget to send a
car!</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Just straightening a little.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: You’re insane, you know that? Finish getting
dressed!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Can you believe this?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It can’t be time! Is it time?</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: I’ll sew it in the car.</p>
<p><strong>lexi</strong>: See? I told you they’d send a car.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Thank you, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: Don’t worry about it. You rip – I sew.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Not just for that. Thank you for getting me
out of bed.</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: Don’t thank me – thank Charles.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Charles?!</p>
<p><strong>assunta</strong>: If that jerk hadn’t of left you, none of
this would’ve happened.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Thank you, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Where’s Vanessa? Has anyone seen
Vanessa?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: I’ll call her house.</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>brian</strong>: I knew you’d get here sooner or later. I’m
glad I’m here to see it.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I am too.</p>
<p><strong>guadalupe</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Perlman?</p>
<p><strong>guadalupe</strong>: I’m Guadalupe. I’ve wanted to meet you
for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>itzhak perlman</strong>: A pleasure to meet you,
Guadalupe.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You nervous, Mr. Perlman?</p>
<p><strong>itzhak perlman</strong>: Should I be?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Us kids are gonna be great – I don’t know
about you guys. How much did you practice?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: You called Vanessa’s father and mother?</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: No answer at either.</p>
<p><strong>staff person</strong>: Half hour call! It’s now half hour
call! So pace yourself accordingly. Don’t get more than thirty minutes
worth of nervous!</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: They stole the car!</p>
<p><strong>mr. klein</strong>: With the violin.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Oh my God. Nick, Lexi –</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>vanessa</strong>: And then when we were getting a taxi, I
fell down.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: C’mon honey – let’s get you cleaned up.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You’re glowing.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: It’s terror.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: When I became the principal of Central Park
East Elementary, I envisioned a school where children could fulfill
their highest potential, despite the challenges of poverty and racism.
Ten years ago, Roberta Guaspari walked into my office because she needed
a job, and because she had a vision that any child could learn the
violin. We put our dreams together and created the East Harlem Violin
Program which has helped more than a thousand students expand their
vision of what’s possible in their lives. When a program like this is
cut, our children’s future is compromised. I want to thank you for your
support. Enjoy the concert.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Everyone – attention please!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I want you all to take a second just to
breathe, O.K.? Deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: I would like you all to play with your
heart, all right? Play like I know you can play. You’ll be wonderful.
Watch me, don’t look out in the audience – you don’t need to be afraid.
It’s gonna be really wonderful. So play – play from here.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Arnold
Steinhardt, Diane Monroe, Michael Tree, Mark O’Connor and Karen
Briggs.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: We’re all here tonight because we have a
bigger mission: to take the magical spirit of tonight’s concert with us
out into the world, and to fight for music and art to be a part of every
child’s education. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: And this? What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: The frog hair?</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Did you ever see a frog with hair?</p>
<p><strong>a few kids</strong>: It’s horsehair!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: That’s right. But you’re right, there is a
frog. Can you show me where it is?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ooh! I know!</p>
<p><strong>roberta</strong>: Sssh – let him answer.</p>
