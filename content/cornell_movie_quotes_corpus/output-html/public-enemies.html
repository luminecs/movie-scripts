<h1 id="public-enemies">public-enemies</h1>
<p><strong>pontiac</strong>: is parked at the curb. It waits.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Time. Thirty year old JOHN HERBERT
DILLINGER is in the backseat. He nods. His arms are behind him. We don’t
know why. Red starts the car and drives forward.</p>
<p><strong>convicts</strong>: Its cold.-Convicts’ uniforms are broadly
striped and frayed. This is a line of hard men branded by prison: shorn
hair, broken nose, eyes with a cold ferocity. And their aggression has a
nihilistic edge; their spirits never surrender. There’s nothing beaten
down about these men. Like Alcatraz, Leavenworth, and Sing Sing, this is
the end of the line.</p>
<p><strong>prison guards</strong>: in visored black caps, black shirts,
black patent leather Sam Browne belts with three-foot long billy clubs
watch the line, poised to unleash violence.</p>
<p><strong>among the hard men are…</strong>: HARRY “PETE” PIERPONT , 6
foot 1 with eerie blue eyes. Brilliant, violent, he hates all authority.
CHARLES MAKLEY , squat with an anvil jaw, facial scars and as calm as
Pierpont is volatile. HOMER VAN METER , tall, an incorrigible clown and
an unemotional killer. He has continued to ridicule guards even when it
cost him months in the hole.</p>
<p><strong>these three</strong>: with an older man, WALTER DIETRICH,
wait for the lam. work call to the prison Shirt Factory…</p>
<p><strong>turnkey</strong>: Afternoon. Hamilton flashes the badge. He
shoves Dillinger inside. In an adjacent room FIVE GUARDS play poker.
Next to them is a barred entrance to the prison yard. As the cage door
locks behind him, this is the last place Dillinger wants to have
entered. Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>boxes</strong>: and bolts of fabric wait for the convicts.
lam. A KLAXON sounds. Door opens. Convicts enter. Walter Dietrich goes
right to the stacks and pulls a box with an “X” crayoned on the side.
Its labeled “Thread.” soldier who invented professional bank robbery by
applying military tactics and who rode with Butch &amp; Sundanc4’s Hole
in the Wall Gang in Utah in 1901. in prison Dietrich passed on Lamm’s
techniques. His brightest student in 1933 is..’ohn</p>
<p><strong>dietrich + “thread” box</strong>: arrive at a busy work
station with Pierpont, Makley and Van Meter. Under spools are four Colt
45 automatics with loaded magazines.</p>
<p><strong>guard dainard</strong>: is approached by Pierpont, who shoves
the 45 in his face.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: Line up! Line up… Dietrich and Van Meter
control THREE OTHER GUARDS. ED SHOUSE, JIM LESLIE and EARL ADAMS - three
other Cons armed with makeshift clubs and spivs – join the escape.
Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>turnkey</strong>: Didn’t you get paroled out of here a few
months ago?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Yes, sir. Three months ago.</p>
<p><strong>turnkey</strong>: . John… Johnnie Dillinger?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: That’s right. But my friends call me
“Johnnie”. You gotta address me as “Mister” Dillinger. Dillinger’s
insubordination puzzles Turnkey so he doesn’t see Hamilton bat a
Thompson submachine gun across the back of his head and swing it onto
the Two Guards…</p>
<p><strong>red/dillinger</strong>: Against the wall! Hands up! Get up!
Dillinger’s cuffs fell away. Now his Thompson covers the stunned
poker°players. Hamilton and Dillinger are as tight as they come.- They
share their food, money, liquor, ammunition and women. ,.id right
now…</p>
<p><strong>yard gate</strong>: is keyed open by Dainard followed by
Pierpont and Makley and the others. Pierpont kicks over the poker table.
Escapees throw all the Guards against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>makley/van meter</strong>: Undress. Get undressed!</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: at the window checks the escape route to
the Pontiac. Its clear. Hamilton conceals his weapon and starts out.
Smooth. He crosses the front lawn, the street car tracks. So far, so
good…</p>
<p><strong>shouse</strong>: Hurry up! C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: This Guard gives Shouse an insolent
look. Shouse slams the Guard’s head with a length of steel pipe. Guard
goes down. Shouse goes wild and continues to hammer his skull again and
again, caving it in.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: Cut it out Shouse!</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Shouse!I Dainard thinks that once the
killing’s begun, he will die… So, he grabs for Homer Van Meter’s .45.
Van Meter SHOOTS Dainard. Dainard’s knocked to the floor. Blood pools. A
SIREN SCREAMS.</p>
<p><strong>red’s pov</strong>: TOWER GUARDS look into the prison
interior where the shots came from.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: arrives, takes Red’s position. Red goes
for the Pon,.c…</p>
<p><strong>escapees</strong>: don’t complete their disguises.
Half-dressed in gua ds’ uniforms, they crash outside…</p>
<p><strong>pierpont’ s</strong>: running with the older Dietrich across
the grass FIRING his</p>
<p><strong>pierpont + dietrich</strong>: arrive.</p>
<p><strong>bang!</strong>: Dietrich is hit in the neck by rifle FIRE
from the East Tower.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Walter! Dillinger falls away. Dillinger
and Pierpont grab Walter’s arms. He’s-paralyzed now. They try to pull
him onto the running boafd, of the moving car. Dietrich’s”hcpeful eyes
look up at them. Then his eyes glaze over. His feet drag down the
street. He’s dead and they know it. They let go.</p>
<p><strong>dillin ger’ s</strong>: Thompson empty, he grabs Red’s
shotgun. He shoves it into Shouse’s chest in the backseat.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Walter’s dead ’cause you screwed it up,
you son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>shouse</strong>: The bastard wouldn’t do what he was told,
Johnny. .Pete? Homer?</p>
<p><strong>van meter</strong>: Let him have it.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: Dietrich was your pal, up to you.
Dillinger sees the abject fear in Shouse’s eyes. And Dillinger’s mood
swings. He lowers the shotgun… Then, he snaps the butt across Shouse’s
face. Breaks Shouse’s cheekbone. Dillinger pulls back and slams the
heavy butt dead center, smashing Shouse’s nose and orbital socket.
Dillinger opens the door and kicks Shouse out of the moving car.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: okay…?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Johnny…? Ready.</p>
<p><strong>the woman</strong>: brings out the dozen fried egg sandwiches
wrapped in newspaper. She looks 40 but is 20. Edwin Norris is at the
door.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Thank you, ma’am. Dillinger’s lopsided
smile is charming.</p>
<p><strong>edwin norris</strong>: Its Miss. She’s my daughter, Viola.
That’ll be eight dollars. Viola retrieves her toddler brother who’s
crawled into the Pontiac. Dellinger peels off a $20 bill.</p>
<p><strong>edwin norris</strong>: Can’t change that…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Well, then you keep the change. $12 is a
lot’–’of money in 1933. Grateful, Norris goes inside, Dillinger passes
Viola and the struggling toddler on the way to the Pontiac,</p>
<p>****: Take me with you, mister. She puts a hand on his forearm.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’m sorry, honey. Pierpont, Homer and
Makley head towards the Plymouth.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Kid didn’t fool with anything, did he?
Dillinger, looking back at the boy, hasn’t heard.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Johnnie? All there? Dillinger lifts the
coats on the backseat: their weapons are as they were.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Its all here.</p>
<p>****: Let’s go make some money. The speeding cars throw up tails of
dust as they drive west to Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>he is melvin purvis</strong>: cleancut and handsome. A square
jaw. Chester Gould modelled Dick Tracy’s profile after Purvis. Has not
big, but he’s tenacious. He’s an incarnation of the social elite of h.is
time: white, Southern patrician and a Christian gentleman. With Purvis
are Special Agents WARREN BARTON and Purvis’s friend CARTER DAUM They
have a harder time in the steep woods. They’re chasing someone. They are
guided by East Liverpool police chief,</p>
<p><strong>bottom of the hill – pretty boy floyd</strong>: is a
big-boned country boy. His blue suit is mud-streaked from his slide down
the hill. He carries a Thompson submachine-gun with a drum magazine, and
he is running for his life.</p>
<p><strong>purv i s , fultz, baum + barton</strong>: race after him.</p>
<p><strong>muddy path - floyd</strong>: half runs, half slips in his
dress shoes. Ahead is a cleared orchard. Floyd leaps the fence…</p>
<p><strong>woods – purvis</strong>: jumping over fallen trees…</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: breaks into the clear.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Floyd! Halt! Purvis aims the Mauser. Perfect
form. Floyd zigzags. Purvis FIRES, misses. Floyd opens up with the
Thompson – wildly at that range. A few .45s splinter nearby branches.
Fultz, Baum and Barton seek cover: Purvis works the bolt and chambers
another round. Floyd is 10 yards from the forest. Purvis kneels onto his
right knee. On his upraised left knee he braces hi left elbow. He
inhales. Starts a smooth squeeze. Ha Tway through the exhale he FIRES.
Floyd’s right arm flies up. He’s punched forward and crashes to the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: regains consciousness. Purvis is running in.
Floyd`s left hand pulls a 45.</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: Look out, Melvin! Purvis kicks the 45 out of
his hand.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: You are under arrest. Floyd sits up to see
the massive exit wound. His right lung and liver are shot through. He
falls back.</p>
<p>****: I’m Floyd. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Melvin Purvis - Department of
Investigation.</p>
<p>****: Where’s your friend Harry Campbell, Floyd?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Ain’t gonna tell you shit. Floyd looks at the
sky.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: And I believe you have killed me. So you can
go and rot in hell, you sonofabitch. He lapses, goes cold and dies.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: He jus’ pulled in.</p>
<p><strong>carole</strong>: Johnny! Dillinger cradles the Thompson in
his arm and crosses to her.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Hey, Red, call Oscar.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Okay. And Berman? Wanna switch-out the
“shorts”?</p>
<p>****: Get a Chrysler and an Essex. Hey, doll… He half picks her up
with one arm around her waist.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You get a hold of Zarkovich…?</p>
<p><strong>carole</strong>: I sure did…</p>
<p>****: Put me down!</p>
<p><strong>jan meter</strong>: Where those gals?! As Homer and Pierpont
head inside…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Jammed twice, Oscar., .main spring’s too
tight.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: cut off one coil.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: And it rides up and to the right on full
auto.</p>
<p><strong>oscar</strong>: I widen port…</p>
<p><strong>johnny.</strong>: Dillinger rises as a 1933 Chrysler and an
Essex Terraplane drive in. Out of the Essex steps HARRY BERMAN, a
Cicero, Illinois auto dealer for the Syndicate.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: Hiya Harry…</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: tosses Berman a rubber banded roll of
bills while…</p>
<p><strong>zarkovioh</strong>: Johnny! How are ya? With him is ANNA
SAGE, a 40 year old well-dressed madam. She kisses Johnny on the
cheek.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Good and so are you. Christmas is coming
early this year. Extra cake’s in here for you and Anna.</p>
<p>****: Still in Hammond, doll?</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: I’m in Chicago on North Halstead now.
Come on by…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Marty, tell me that me and my boys are
okay…</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: Long as you stay in my town, you’re in
safe haven. Dillinger tosses Marty the envelope. This is Dillinger’s
support and resupply network.</p>
<p><strong>carole</strong>: Wanna go out later, sugar?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I want to sit here with you and listen to
the radio, baby.</p>
<p>****: I have missed you like nobody’s business…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: John Dillinger seems like a romantic
husband with his little wife Betty. And it feels a little out of
place…</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: Why do we need this?</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Because of the new breed of mobile outlaws
who flee jurisdiction by crossing state lines over highways and against
whom this government must wage a war on crime. J. EDGAR HOOVER is a
physically short man but has a dynamic presence. He is a dapper
patrician who believes in elites. He is completely free from self-doubt.
He is youthful and 33 years old. SUYDAM and TOLSON sit next to him.
MCKELLAR i�’Chairman of the Senate Appropriations Sub- Committee.-,He’s
an avuncular man of 62.</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: And so in the middle of a Great Depression
you’re looking for a budget increase to build up your Department? But by
my tally your Department of Investigation spends more taxpayer’s dollars
catching crooks than what the crooks you catch stole in the first
place…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: That’s ridiculous. The Bureau’s apprehended
kidnappers, bank robbers, who have stolen up to…</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: How many criminals you apprehended?</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: We’ve arrested and arraigned 213 wanted
felons…</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: No. I mean you. How many?</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: As Director I’ve administered…</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: No. How many have you arrested?
Personally.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: I’ve never arrested anybody.</p>
<p>****: You never arrested anybody?</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: I’m an administrator.</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: With no field experience. For once Hoover
is silent.</p>
<p>****: In fact you are shockingly unqualified, aren’t you, sir? You
have never personally conducted a criminal investigation in the field in
your life= Others in the room stare at Hoover. McKellar leans’-back…</p>
<p>****: I think you are a front. I think your prowess as a lawman is a
myth created from a hoopla of headlines by Mr. Suydam, your publicist
there. You are trying to make a federal police force with you set up as
its Czar. That is runnin’ wild in my estimation…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Crime is what runs wild in this country,
Mr. Chairman. And…</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: And if the country required an expanded
Bureau, I question you are the person most fit to run it while…</p>
<p>****: I won’t be judged by a kangaroo court of venal politicians…</p>
<p><strong>mckellar</strong>: While outlaws like Dillinger, Clyde
Barrow, the Barkers, and Nelson flourish unabated.</p>
<p>****: Your appropriation request is denied. The hearing’s over.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. u.s. congress, corridor - j. edgar hoover -day</strong>:
walks fast through the corridor of congressmen. He talks over his left
shoulder to Suydam and Tolson. They struggle to hear him…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Find out: was he soft on the Reds in ,1919?
Does he use prostitutes? Peppy `tuf f like that. And feed this to Walter
=!rii„inchell: “McKellar’s a Neanderthal. He’s</p>
<p><strong>o7</strong>: a personal vendetta to destroy me.” Like
that.</p>
<p>****: We’ll fight him on the front page. Not in his damn committee
room… Where’s Dillinger?</p>
<p><strong>tolson</strong>: Spotted in Hammond, Indiana.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: How long ago?</p>
<p><strong>tolson</strong>: Yesterday. Another sighting has him on the
Lincoln Highway in Ohio heading towards Cincinnati.</p>
<p>****: He’s in Hammond. Heading to Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>suydam</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: You can have fun in Chicago. What the hell’s
there to do in Cincinnati?</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Agent Purvis, congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Thank you sir. May I ask why?</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Pretty Boy Floyd, for which you have my
commendation and personal gratitude. Second, you are, as of this moment,
the Special Agent in Charge of the Chicago field office. Your task will
be to get John Dillinger. Are you up to it?</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Absolutely, sir. Purvis is imbued. Henry
Suydam enters.</p>
<p><strong>suydam</strong>: They’re ready for him.</p>
<p>****: This is Henry Suydam.. He is our expert in congressional and
press relations. INT. BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION w HOOVER ESCORTS PURVIS
THROUGH</p>
<p><strong>the open plan office</strong>: Tolson + Suydam follow. It’s
like the “Corporate Office of the Future” designed by Albrecht Speer.
Agents are at grey metal desks dressed identically in dark suits, white
shirts, dark ties. No personal effects. The individual is reduced to a
component in a gleaming machine.</p>
<p><strong>tolson</strong>: hurry down the staircase.</p>
<p>****: Why are you sure you’re up to this task, Mr. Purvis?</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: We have two weapons that cannot be
defeated.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: The Bureau’s modern techniques of
investigation and your visionary leadership.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: You let Mr. Tolson, here, know if you need
anything, Melvin, anything at all,</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Call me J.E. They shake hands. There’s a mob
of photographers and newsmen and microphones to interview him.</p>
<p><strong>extremely close: melvin purvis</strong>: is awed. He’s imbued
with purpose. He’s been anointed Hoover’s Crimebuster. He claimed he was
up to the task. “Is he?” he asks himself right now. And he didn’t expect
to be overcome by doubt. He struggles with anxiety. Then, he pushes that
aside and forces himself to take the step forward into the lights and
flashbulbs.</p>
<p><strong>suydam</strong>: Our own Clark Gable…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Grover stands and flattens against the
back wall, as if trying to permeate the masonry and disappear into the
back alley. Dillinger peels him off the wall and steers him towards the
vault.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Let’s play a game, Mr. President. Its
called spin the dial.</p>
<p>****: Seven minutes! Dillinger is the Vault Man. And alarm
sounds.</p>
<p><strong>wide: a bank robbery in progress - pierpont</strong>: is the
Lobby Man. His back is to the front door. He controls the customers on
the inside. Women are seated on the floor. Men stand. It’s well-ordered.
Pete doesn’t worry about his back because…</p>
<p><strong>manley</strong>: is at the tellers’ drawers. His job is to
shovel cash into a canvas bag. The Tellers stand aside.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger`s</strong>: at the vault with Weyland. Weyland
hesitates. Dillinger’s right hand with the Thompson covers Tellers so
Makley can work. His left hand draws one of the two 45s he keeps in twin
shoulder holsters and he cracks Grover Weyland across the forehead. He
aims the .45 between Weyland’s eyes…</p>
<p>****: You can be a dead hero or a live coward. Grover Weyland OPENS
THE VAULT. Dillinger checks his watch.</p>
<p>****: Company! NO ONE inside stops working. They know Van Meter will
do his job.</p>
<p><strong>van meter</strong>: – who let him go. Van Meter keeps his eye
on the other THREE COPS. Two get behind the cover of parked cars across
the street. ONE stays low and runs towards Homer.</p>
<p>****: Hold it! Hands up! PIERPONT, behind him, slams the butt of the
Thompson into the back of his head, knocking him flat, and disarms him.
He rouses. Pete doesn’t like authority. Pete hits him again. Blood pools
onto the floor. A WOMAN faints, collapsing. Peters dead calm. He looks
over the half-painted windows. The growing crowd on the sidewalk is
getting too large…</p>
<p><strong>he fires</strong>: at the glass. People scramble for cover as
it CRASHES onto Main Street. Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Hey, you. Move out of there!</p>
<p><strong>van meter</strong>: Why should I? I wanna watch. Angry Cop
rushes him. Homer slams him in the gut with his rifle, disarms him and
uses him as a shield. He backs to the front door. Pedestrians flee. Cops
draw down. They cannot shoot without Homer blowing off the Cop’s head.
Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: That your money there, mister?</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Yessir. It is.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Well, go ahead and put it away. We’re
here for the bank’s money. Not your money. Customers appreciate
Dillinger. Dillinger loves their- appreciation…</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: You three! Let’s go! .to three pretty
TELLERS hiding under a desk.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Folks, stay calm and stay low. Pierpont
grabs two; Dillinger takes one, creating a human shield around them
–</p>
<p><strong>city detectives</strong>: pull up in front of Wylie’s Hat
shop. Dillinger’s crew is crossing fast to Red’s Buick, as…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger opens up</strong>: and the Wylie Hat Shop windows
blow out. A DETECTIVE with a deer rifle aims.</p>
<p><strong>van meter</strong>: FIRES past his hostage’s head. Detective
goes down. The Hostage’s eardrum is blown. His ear bleeds.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger shoots up…</strong>: City Detectives’ car, police
car and a few others.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: C’mere, honey. Buick’s moving faster.
Dillinger pulls her onto the running board next–:o Boyard. The Buick
roars away.</p>
<p><strong>makley</strong>: 2 miles - turn left at the white barn. Right
there. Now. 6 miles to the new bridge. Pierpont breaks out the rear
window. He throws two five gallon milk jars full of roofing nails out
into the road. They scatter.</p>
<p><strong>two police cars</strong>: hit the nails, their tires blow.
ROUNDS from the Buick finish dissuading them to pursue.</p>
<p>****: Okay. Beat it!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Three hostages jump off. Dillinger pulls
Anna Patzke and Weyland inside.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: sees Anna Patzke’s shivering from shock
and the cold. He puts his coat on her. He plops his hat on her head,
too.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Something to remember me by. She laughs,
nervously, and a little thrilled at being where she is…</p>
<p>****: Are we taking `em to the hideout?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: That depends.</p>
<p><strong>van meter</strong>: How ’bout it, honey? Can you cook?</p>
<p><strong>anna patzke</strong>: Uh. Sure… After a fashion. They start
to hoot and laugh. They think this is h±l iiou.s.</p>
<p><strong>anna patzke</strong>: Well, its true!</p>
<p><strong>van meter</strong>: When I’m not doing this, I’m a scout for
the movies.</p>
<p><strong>anna patzke</strong>: Really? This makes them laugh even
harder.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: Face each other. Join hands. Pierpont
binds them loosely to the tree.</p>
<p><strong>weyland</strong>: We’ll freeze.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You’ll worm your way out of that in about
ten minutes. Anna looks over at Dellinger.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: It’s okay, doll. You’re just gonna be a
little late for dinner. Dillinger reaches over, snatches his hat off
Anna Patzke’s head. He leaves her his coat.</p>
<p><strong>the buick work car</strong>: is abandoned.</p>
<p><strong>track right + see</strong>: Dillinger’’b Essex and a Ford
drive off past fields with snow on both sides. New cars. Flush with
cash. Clean.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: INT. CHICAGt7: BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION
OFFICES - PURVIS - DAY</p>
<p>****: looks at the gathered agents. New faces. College men.</p>
<p><strong>warren barton</strong>: holds up the coat Dillinger left on
Anna Patzke.</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: .manufactured by Freeman &amp; Freeman in
St. Louis. We are identifying all stores that sold this coat. We note
AGENTS COWLEY, RICE, CLEGG + RORER. DORIS ROGERS is Purvis’ secretary.
He brought her from his last post in Alabama along with Barton and Baum.
We’ve entered mid-scene.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Then we will cross-reference every Dillinger
family member and known associate in each locale.</p>
<p>****: He was there. It got cold. He bought a coat. Therefore, he may
have been harbored or have a safe house nearby.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: By such techniques we will get
Dillinger.</p>
<p>****: Doris…</p>
<p>****: For those of you who haven’t met her, Miss Rogers is my
secretary… Please contact the Chicago telephone exchange supervisors.
Request appointments for Carter Baum or myself.</p>
<p>****: We are going to be working long hours. It will be dangerous.
Those of you who aren’t prepared for that, can go. And if you’re going
to go, go now. Thank you, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>e/i. aragon ballroom, chicago - on dillinger -
night</strong>: watching a sexy young woman on the dance floor. He loses
sight of her… He’s expecting someone. Then, Dillinger sees her again:
jet black hair in a bob, brown eyes, high cheekbones fom:her Indian
mother and a great smile. She lights up a ro om. She is</p>
<p><strong>billie frechette .</strong>: She feels the stare and looks
over. She studies him, then looks away. Dillinger’s with Pierpont,
Makley and Hamilton at a table. It is loaded with steaks, oysters, and
frog legs. ALVIN KARPIS and Homer Van Meter approach and Alvin sits next
to Johnnie… Dillinger adjusts his chair to watch for the girl. He’s
shoulder to shoulder to Karpis.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Hiya, Alvin. You hungry? How’s Freddie
and Dock? everyone, including J. Edgar Hoover, and retire to
Torremolinos, Spain, where he will die of heart failure in</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Everyone’s good. We been looking to snatch
two fellas. One’s a St. Paul banker, Ed Bremer. Need a few more
hands.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Don’t like kidnapping.</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Robbing banks is getting tougher.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: The public don’t like kidnappers.</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Who gives a damn what the public likes?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I do. I hide out among them.</p>
<p>****: ,L -am strictly out to make cake.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: .: yeah, then you, Ma, Dock and Freddie
hole up like hermits on farms for six months. I grew up on a goddamn
farm. I hate farms. I like big cities, crowds and a good time…</p>
<p>****: Well, we got a mail train we been lookin’ at, too.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Say, by the way, if someone got pinched
here, who can get’em out real fast?</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Lawyer named Piquett. We all use him.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: What about this train?..</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Needs two, three more months to set up. I
need seven or eight real right guys to take it down.</p>
<p>****: Sounds like Jesse James.</p>
<p>****: A million seven, a million eight. Dillinger looks at Karpis. In
2007, that would be $22 million.</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Federal Reserve shipment. It runs only twice
a month. This is the kind of score you go away on after.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Where you gonna go?</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Brazil. Cuba, maybe. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Were having too good a time today. We
ain’t worryin’ about tomorrow yet…</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: You ought to. What we’re doin’ here, don’t
last forever. They lock at each other: two pros at the top of their
game.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Keep me in mind on the train. Karpis
leaves. Dellinger can’t see Billie anymore.</p>
<p>****: Let’s snatch Bremer…</p>
<p>****: Know how much they made snatchin’ that Hamm Brewery guy?
$250,000. Dillinger looks at Pierpont.</p>
<p><strong>p ierpont</strong>: Shut your yap, Homer.</p>
<p><strong>makley</strong>: Let’s get our of here. Pierpont, Homer and
Makley leave.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Homer stayin’ steady?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: He’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Three rules I learned from Walter
Dietrich. One: never work with people who are desperate. Two: never work
with people who aren’t the best. Three: never work when you’re not
ready. Billie reappears, dancing with a young man.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Well, I got rule four: stay away from
women.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Without women, I might as well have
`stayed in stir. Anna Sage approaches with a young girl for Red.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: What’s why they invented whores. Hamilton
leaves, arms around the women. Dillinger keeps his eye on Billie. Music
ends. Young man escorts her to her table. He tries to join her. She
turns him down. Dillinger finishes his drink, approaches. He now sees
how beautiful Billie is. She’s 5 foot 5. With a straight erect build,
she stands out in any crowd. She looks Dillinger straight in the eye.
Clear skin, dark eyes with humor playing about the edges. He
unexpectedly starts to feel nervous. He gives her his best grin.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I don’t know what you said to your
friend, but I sure am glad you did. Billie looks him over: a well-made
man in a good suit with a great smile. And, paradoxes: he easily talks
to women but he’s not a hustler. He’s young, but there’s a world of
experience in his face. Open, but he’s holding something back.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Billie Frechette.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Buy you a drink? Billie looks at her
girlfriend, she nods, Billie rises… As they cross to the bar.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Is that French?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: On my father’s side. There’s an “e” at the
end. Do you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Jack Harris. Music changes to “Bye Bye
Blackbird.”</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Do you dance, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I don’t know how. She smiles a pretty
smile at him.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: How come you don’t know how to dance? Its
easy. Follow me. This is a two-step. Don’t look at my feet. Look at my
shoulders. She stays an inch or two distant in his arms. Its slow and
languorous. He follows her with little difficulty. He can smell the
perfume in her black hair.</p>
<p>****: „Pack-up all my cares and woe Here I go, singing low Bye, bye
blackbird”</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: My, but you are pretty.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They look into each other’s eyes. He
pulls her closer, wants to kiss her long smooth neck. He almost can’t
resist… Their lips are an inch apart. And then she rests her cheek on
his shoulder and the kiss that wasn’t hangs in the air around them. He
whispers…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger.</strong>: Where you from, Billie? She turns her
right ear towards him. She’s deaf in her left ear.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Flandreau.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Where’s Flandreau.?</p>
<p>****: “Where somebody waits for me Sugar’s sweet, so is she Bye, bye
blackbird…”</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: outh Dakota.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Father’s French, what’s on the other
side?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Italian.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: From South Dakota, Indian’s likelier than
Italian. She looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: My momma’s a Menominee Indian. But most men
don’t like that…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’m not most men.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: And I check coats at the Steuben Club. What
do you do, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’m catching up.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Catching up on what?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: On life, meeting someone like you. Dark,
beautiful, like the black bird in that song… She laughs at the flattery.
Holds his eyes a beat with an ironic look. A couple from another group
looks at Dillinger. He’s cool. He returns the look. They look away.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Say, how’d you like some dinner?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Sure. He nods courteously to her
girlfriends, grabs her coat, puts a hand around Billie’s waist and
steers her out…</p>
<p>****: “So make my bed and light the light Cause I’ll be home late
tonight Bye, bye blackbird… .”</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: What are you gonna have?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Billie stares at him, ignoring her
menu.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: What is it, exactly, you do for a living?
Dillinger looks over the top of his menu.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Well…I rob banks. Then he leans back in
his chair and regards her.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: That’s where all these people here put
their money.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Why’d you tell me that? You could have made
up a story…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: ’Cause I can’t lie to you. she studies
him carefully.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: ;,;.at’s a pretty serious thing to say to a
woman you just met.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I feel like I know you.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Well, I haven’t been any of the places
you’ve been. So I don’t even know what I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Some of the places I been ain’t so hot.
Where I’m going is a lot better. Wanna come along?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Boy, you are in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: If you were looking at what I am looking
at, honey, you’d be in a hurry too. She laughs at his flattery, which
she is also finding persuasive.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Well, its me they’re looking at this
time.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: That’s ’cause you’re beautiful. A blonde
woman, elegant and ice cold, stares at Billie, a Depression-era child in
her dress.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: That’s nice. But they’re looking at me
because they’re not used to having a Menominee Indian girl in their
restaurant in a three dollar dress.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Listen, doll, that’s ’cause they’re all
about where people come from. Only thing important is where somebody’s
going.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: To the top. He’s irresistible.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Let’s get out of here. Beat. She nods.
They get up, get their things. On their way…a man intercepts Dillinger.
He is GILBERT CATENA , solid with big hands. He’s smiling.</p>
<p>****: Hey Johnny…: Dillinger reacts, changes down, says coldly…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Go wait outside. I’ll be right there.
Billie turns and walks out of the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: How you been, Gil?</p>
<p><strong>catena</strong>: Real good. I work for Mr. Nitti now. Been
with him since I got out of Michigan… Catena indicates FRANK NITTI in a
group at a table. Sober and educated, Nitti glances in their direction
but has no interest.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Looks like a barber.</p>
<p><strong>catena</strong>: Don’t go by looks.</p>
<p>****: He’s real smart. We’re connected to everybody all over the
country now… From Nitti’s table a man gets up and walks straight towards
Dillinger. He is PHIL D’ANDREA. Two heavy duty bodyguards are with him.
Dillinger unbuttons his jacket. But…</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: Everytime I read about one of your jobs,
where you give people back their money, ’You crack me up…</p>
<p>****: Ypu need anything, Gilbert knows how to find me. D’Andrea
continues to the men’s room.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: See you. Gilbert…</p>
<p><strong>catena</strong>: Good luck Johnnie.</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: That noise on the line? That’s called “swing”.
Nothing we can do about it. Some words get dropped. Were listening in on
a car dealer. Harry Berman. Rice plays back a recording.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: When you drop it, leave the keys on the
floorboard.</p>
<p><strong>b e rman</strong>: I got a DeSoto.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: okay.</p>
<p><strong>berman</strong>: The interior’s no good.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Don’t matter. It’s a work. car.</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: We think that’s Dillinger’s voice.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: How did we find Berman?</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: Dillinger’s coat was bought in Cicero,
Illinois, a few doors from Berman’s dealership. Berman supplies cars to
the syndicate. Since Capone. Dillinger must have been at Berman’s
switching cars when he bought that coat.</p>
<p>****: Soon as they call to switch out the next car, we will tail
them. Right to Dillinger.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: TWO MEN approach. Billie checks their
hats and coats. To Dillinger…</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: May I check your coat, sir?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: No, honey. You go get your coat. She
looks up. So does May. May flashes Billie a look: if you don’t want him,
I do.</p>
<p><strong>may minczeles</strong>: Sounds good to me. Dillinger has eyes
only for Billie.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You ran out on me.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: `you left me standing alone on the
sidewalk.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I ’you’re going to be my girl, you have
swear you’ll never do that again.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I’m not your girl! A CUSTOMER comes up and
puts his ticket on the counter.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Brown overcoat.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I am not your girl and I’m not going to say
that.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’m waiting.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger.</strong>: “I am not ever going to run out on you
again.” Say it.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Well, I will never run out on you. And
that’s a promise.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Well, I want to run out of here. So, lady,
will you get my coat…? Dillinger lifts the man two feet off the floor
and slams him into the wall. Real jailhouse rage. The lethally cold eyes
tells the customer everything he needs to know. Dillinger swings him to
the counter, grabs the man’s ticket, slams thru the half door, finds the
man’s coat, tosses it at him…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Keep the tip. You ain’t getting other
people’s hats and coats no more either. He takes her coat and holds it
for her. She doesn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: No one’s ever done that for me before.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You’re with me now.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I don’t know anything about you.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I was raised on a farm in Mooresville,
Indiana. My ma died when I was three. My daddy beat the hell out of me
because he didn’t know no better way to raise me. I used to do dumb
things but I’m a lot smarter now. I like baseball, movies, good clothes,
fast cars, and you. What else do you need to know? She gets into her
coat. Dillinger opens the door for her. They exit, watched by May.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. dillinger’s apartment, living room - billie -
night</strong>: enters. It’s large, low-ceilinged, luxurious and modern
— Billie is bowled over. He sits her down on a sofa.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He goes into a closet to get two
Marshall Fields boxes and two drinks.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: You been living here long?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Yeah. Since yesterday. From a back
bedroom a phonograph is louder as a door opens and Red enters the
kitchen in a robe for a drink. He returns. Laughter. Dillinger has the
boxes and drinks.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I got something for you.</p>
<p>****: What’s wrong? Open it up. Billie opens the boxes. She lifts out
a sleeveless dress in dusty pink. It is beautiful. She is very touched.
The second has a coat with a fur color. But still…</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I’m drinking in a man’s apartment who
.:W.ants to romance me. Okay. I’m no “Pollyanna, but there are things
that you Kati would bother a girl like me…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: We<code>rob banks</code>cause banks is
where they keep the money. I can make 500 dollars in a year or I can
make ten thousand dollars in a morning. I’ll take my chances on the
bank. No apologies. We don’t go lookin’ to hurt anybody. But if somebody
gets in our way, that’s gotta be their problem. That what you want to
know?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I’m trying to get to know you.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You want to get to know me?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She gets up and wanders around the room.
He thinks she’s the most beautiful creature he’s ever seen. She’s
looking at his stuff. She sees suitcases that are packed, ready to leave
in a heartbeat. Everything’s so neat. She touches his folded shirt…</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: .smooth</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Egyptian cotton. Since we been out I go
for the finest stuff. As much as I can get, as fast we can get it.</p>
<p>****: Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Nowhere. What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: You’re all packed.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Always are. Ready to get up and go in a
heartbeat… She stands next to him in the bed now. He pulls her down next
to him.. She turns her good ear towards him.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: What’s wrong with the other ear?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I was married once. He was too handy with
his fists. She stares at Dillinger. Will this put him off.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Where’s he now?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: In prison. I divorced him. Only mistake I
made was marrying him in the first place. He got caught mugging a
mailman…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: A criminal mastermind…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She turns over and puts her mouth next
to his ear. It gets amorous through…</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: After my daddy died, we went to live on the
reservation in Flandreau. In Flandreau nothin’ ever happened.</p>
<p>****: When I was 13, we went to live with my Aunt Ines in Milwaukee
where my cousin Frances had a lot of Indian friends who went around to
churches and put on plays like “Little Fireface.” And nothing exciting
ever happened to me there, either. So I haven’t been anywhere or done
anything in my whole life except come to Chicago and try to make my
way.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Well baby-you’re going to start a new and
exciting kind of life from right now. And as they’re pulled to each
other and start making love again, she stops…</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: heat do you want?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: To please you. That’s not what she meant,
but gently, he rolls her over on the bed. A smile spreads slowly across
her lips.</p>
<p><strong>night – intercut</strong>: Baum in his shirtsleeves in front
of the recorders is talking to Purvis as he puts on his coat.</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: Rorer tailed it. Berman dropped it in an alley
next to the Sherone Apartments 20 minutes ago. Rorer talked to a
neighbor. Men go in and out at night carrying heavy suitcases. One looks
like Dillinger.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Let’s go. Right now. They race out.</p>
<p><strong>purvi s</strong>: Where are your men?</p>
<p><strong>cowley</strong>: My car’s on Sheridan and Montrose and Rice
in the Ford is on Sheridan and Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Blocking vehicles? End of this street?
Alley? They aren’t “deployed.” They’re merely “here”. Cowley gets it.
Purvis exchanges a look with Baum, checks his gun.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Carter, take the back. Barton, you’re with
me.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: I’m Special Agent Melvin Purvis, Miss Scott.
Are you alone?</p>
<p><strong>vi scott</strong>: No - my fiance is here.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: What’s your fiance’s name?</p>
<p><strong>vi scott</strong>: Leonard… McHenry.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: May we come in?</p>
<p><strong>vi scott</strong>: Sure. I’m perfectly safe… But come on in.
She holds the door open.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: You have identification?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Honey, would you get my driver’s licence.
It’s in my coat pocket. Leonard sums reluctant to get up. With his right
hand, he takes a forkful of food. His left is under the table. Now, we
see that he:.’s holding…</p>
<p><strong>a colt 45_.-,automatic</strong>: Who is this man?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: You’re that.. .Melvin Purvis. I’ve seen
your picture!</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: What do you do for a living, Leonard?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: I travel in ladies shoes. He smiles at his
joke. Vi enters with his wallet. Barton sees the driver’s license.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Show him, honey. Vi Scott puts a foot
forward - a red shoe with a bow.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Do you carry around samples?</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Sure. Big suitcases.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Enjoy the rest of your dinner,
Mr. McHenry.</p>
<p><strong>leonard</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>****: Its all wrong. No one in or out. I’ll get the others. Stay
here, watch that door from right here. Purvis leaves. Barton wants to do
it right. Then, he hears movement from Apt. 302. Objects being hurriedly
shifted. He starts back down the hallway. Halfway between it and the
elevator…</p>
<p><strong>ping!</strong>: Behind him, the elevator doors open. Barton
turns hi.,,back on Apt. 302. He’s caught between 302 and the
elevator.-“.-</p>
<p><strong>tommy carroll</strong>: a flat-nosed ex-con enters. He looks
curiously at Barton.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Bureau of Investigation. What’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>carroll</strong>: You wanna know my name? Barton sees
Carroll’s eyes flicker, slight smile. He spins…</p>
<p><strong>an indifferent “baby face” nelson</strong>: FIRES his .45.
BLAM! BLAM! Barton’s slammed forward. Nelson looks at Barton, prostrate,
convulsing. He FIRES a third round.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Pull the men from Sheridan and Wilson.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: -reacting- grabs the Thompson from Madala
and runs back inside.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: in the final moments of his life. Barton
looks up into Purvis` eyes: Help me! Purvis does not know what to do.
Then Barton’s eyes drift away… Purvis impels himself to action. He kicks
in the door to Apt.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Where is he?!</p>
<p><strong>baby face nelson + tommy carroll</strong>: quickly cross the
alley from the back stairs to the Desoto. And Nelson immediately lays
down rounds in careful short BLASTS of full auto. Tommy Carroll calmly,
smoothly starts the DeSoto. Nelson’s barrage punches into the wall,
drives Daum to cover.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: They headed north! The Sheridan Road
car?</p>
<p><strong>rice</strong>: That’s us. We heard gunfire. So we. .came
here. They’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>madala</strong>: Was it Dillinger?</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: No. It was Lester Gillis. Purvis sinks.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: The man we let get away wasn’t John
Dillinger.</p>
<p>****: It was Baby Face Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont + makley - day</strong>: wearing overcoats and hats
with guns tucked inside, all walk into the bank. Six CUSTOMERS.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: Change a. twenty? Teller looks up at
Pierpont but is staring into the 45 cal. barrel of a Tommy gun
while…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: vaults the five foot divider railing and
trains two 45s on the TELLERS.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Get over to the vault! Everybody! Go
on!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He herds the tellers over. Pierpont
makes customers sit in chairs. The vault door is already open…</p>
<p><strong>ecu: the git,</strong>: the detailed map of their getaway
route.</p>
<p><strong>homer</strong>: on Lookout watches the street. Nothing.
Dillinger and Pierpont carrying canvas bags cross through the foreground
as…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: That was a miserable piece of work.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Yes, it was. I take full responsibility,
sir. Hoover calms for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: And I’d like to request we hire part time
agents with “special qualifications”… from outside the Bureau.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: I thought you understood what I am
doing…build.ing a department of professional investigators. Young
college men with law or accounting degrees from good families. No, you
may not go outside the Bureau, Purvis.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: The Bureau has used these men before.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: They are not our “type.”</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Our “type” cannot get the job done…</p>
<p>****: Without qualified help I would have to resign this appointment.
Otherwise, I am leading my men to slaughter. Hoover is backed against
the wall. He does not like it.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Mr. Tolson will call you, Agent Purvis.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Thank you…</p>
<p>****: Hoover hung up on him.</p>
<p><strong>charles winstead, clarence hurt + gerry campbell</strong>:
Stiff from the journey, they stretch, take in the crowd. Winstead is in
his mid 40s, 5 foot 8, body out of steel cable. Hurt is in his late 30s.
These men are ex-Texas Rangers. Unlike flashier Texan lawmen of the
period, they do not wear Western wear unless they’re on a horse. That’s
for drugstore cowboys out to impress Easterners. They wear dark suits
and ties and hats. They have “special qualifications.”</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: What’d he say he looked like?</p>
<p><strong>hurt</strong>: Didn’t say. Their suitcases have been set on
the platform. A PORTER approaches.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Gentlemen need a hand?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Winstead gestures at their bags and one
case. The PORTER goes to lift the case. It is so heavy he can barely
raise it. Campbell picks up the other end. They toss it on the cart„</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Hardware salesmen?</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: That’s right. His terse reply makes the
garrulous porter stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>campbell</strong>: I’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>hurt</strong>: I’m going to the men’s room. Winstead spots a
shoe-shine stand. Winstead sits, nods and the SHOE SHINE MAN begins to
polish his Western boots. He’s startled bi:the knife in a sheath built
into the right boot.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: Wcrk around it. From under the brim of his
hat, Winstead glances at big city life in Union Station. He’s an ominous
presence. HEAR the excited roar of a CROWD and we –</p>
<p><strong>sleek grey hounds</strong>: race in a pack after it under
cumulous clouds and palm trees. Streamline deco stands are almost
filled.</p>
<p><strong>frank nitti</strong>: by the railing, watches the race with
Phil D’An.drea. As they begin to walk…</p>
<p><strong>nitti</strong>: I want Johnny Patton out front on the other
four tracks. Tell Adonis. He can have the parking concessions, and
maintenance.</p>
<p>****: Annenberg wants to sell you the remaining equity in General
News.</p>
<p><strong>nitti</strong>: How’s he doing on the wire service?</p>
<p><strong>phil d’andrea</strong>: Feeding to 300 bookies now. And he
came up with this gimmick called a scratch sheet. Another beat. Nitti
stops for a beat</p>
<p><strong>nitti</strong>: Its hot out, right?</p>
<p><strong>phil d’andrea</strong>: Yeah, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>nitti</strong>: Ever since those pricks shot me I can’t get
warm. What?</p>
<p><strong>phil d’ andrea</strong>: Some friends from Chicago in the
stands… D’Andrea nods. John Dillinger nods back. Nitti glances at them;
glances away. Dillinger has on sunglasses. Billie is wearing a straw
hat. They are shouting to the greyhounds along with Pierpont, Homer and
Makley and some girls. They have tall drinks. This is the good life for
the privileged few in the middle of the Depression. A dog wins; not
theirs. It calms down…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Well drive out separately.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Billie and I want to hit the Gulf Coast
on the way to Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: I want to take 66 and check banks in
Denver and Phoenix. We’ll meet you in Tucson on the 25th.</p>
<p><strong>van meter</strong>: I think we wore out the Midwest for
awhile.</p>
<p>****: I heard one today. Indiana paper.</p>
<p>****: “Wanted. John Dillinger. Dead or…dead.” Billie doesn’t laugh.
Dillinger pulls her close and she can’t resist his good spirits.
D’Andrea’s approached…</p>
<p><strong>phil d’andrea</strong>: How d’ya like the track? C’mon to the
Gc: -lonial for steaks tonight. You be our guests…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Well be there.</p>
<p><strong>phil d’andrea</strong>: Whatever these boys want, its on the
house. He leaves. Pierpont, Makley and Homer go off to place new bets.
Billie looks at Dillinger. Looks away. Dillinger catches her…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: What? She is quiet for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Thank you, thank you for these last few
weeks. I never thought I’d see Florida.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You going somewhere, doll, am I?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: It’s been, three, four weeks. You’ll look
for a change. Or you’ll get tired of me. And then I’ll be sad and angry.
So I wanted to say thank you before then… Dillinger is surprised that
her expectations are so low. She didn’t think his interest in her to be
more than passing.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You want to leave?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: No. But I’m no fool. I’ll be back checking
coats at the Steuben Club.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Well, I don’t want you to leave. So it
won’t be that way.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Then it will be another way that’s
worse.</p>
<p>****: You rob banks and you run rings around them, but you’re likely
to get killed or, get shot and…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Who the hell gave you a crystal
ball?!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, goddamn it, you don’t need a crystal
ball…! Ask Homer.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Homer what…?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Homer and his damn joke… I don’t want to be
around to see any of that. Okay?! That’s what it’s about… Dillinger gets
it.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I am not going anywhere! I am going to
die in your arms as an old man when that time comes. So what do you say
about that?</p>
<p><strong>close on billie</strong>: Now is the first time she allows
herself to have any prospect about a future with him. It’s a shock.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She hikes up her skirt and sits on his
lap and smothers him with a kiss. Her hat falls off. Patrons nearby
glance and look away. Dillinger doesn’t give a damn. A new pack of dogs
are about to take flight.</p>
<p>****: A fresh and tanned Dillinger and Billie are in a strikingly
modern gas station on Route 66. Billie helps out a family by taking
their picture with a Kodak Brownie in front of a Saguaro cactus.
Snow-capped Rincon mountains are behind them. She leans down to play
with the round baby. She looks over at Johnnie and smiles. It breaks his
heart.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Frank Sullivan of Green Bay, Wd
cons in. How was your journey, sir?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: ., • ng.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I can send up some sandwiches and beer, if
you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: That would be swell. Some friends of mine
should be here already. J.C. Davies and Mr. Long?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Out shopping, I believe. I’ll let them know
you’re in when they come back. Old BELLHOP takes Billie’s bag to the
elevator. Dillinger carries his own case.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You want company?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: After.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: First time you ever put me off. You
getting tired of me?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Get in here. She stretches out and wets her
hair. She sits up to reach for the shampoo. Dillinger’s got it and rubs
it into her hair. Dillinger hears something in the street. He goes to
the window and sees a car parked irregularly. TWO MEN get out.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Get dressed. Right now. He turns and runs
into…</p>
<p><strong>crash!</strong>: THREE MEN burst in. One is the Clerk. He
cracks Dillinger across the head with the stock of his shotgun.
Dillinger falls to his knees. Clerk hits him twice more. Billie rushes
into the room.. She’s naked. The two men from the street haul Dillinger,
bloody and semi-conscious, to his feet and throw him against the wall
and cuff him.</p>
<p><strong>clerk/eyman</strong>: Put clothes on, miss.</p>
<p><strong>pierpont + makley</strong>: escorted by six guards are being
moved out of the jail.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: Fire in the hotel. Firemen found our guns.
Laid for us! Sorry, John.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Where they taking you?</p>
<p><strong>pierpont</strong>: We’re getting Shanghaied to Ohio!</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Where’s Billie…? Thenthey’re gone. They
now move Dillinger through.</p>
<p><strong>cop eyman</strong>: Your girl’s been put on a bus back to
Chicago. We ain’t holding her.</p>
<p><strong>melvin purvis</strong>: is there. Cowley and Baum are with
him. Purvis is brought to the cell. The COP who brought him goes back to
his card game with four or five Tucson Deputies. We SEE Winstead and
Hurt in their suits and ties are there, too. They lounge at ease. A
Tucson Deputy gives them coffee. Eye contact with Dillinger. But
Dillinger reacts to Purvis.</p>
<p>****: Well, the man who killed Pretty Boy Floyd. He might have been
“Pretty,” ’cause he sure was not “Whiz Kid Floyd.” Deputies stifle
laughter. Dillinger comes up close to Purvis. They are eyeball to
eyeball. Only the bars separate them.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Now these Arizona boys, here?</p>
<p>****: They pulled on us right out. Didn’t ask Washington for
permission. Didn’t make mistakes. Arizona Deputies enjoy the flattery.
Dillinger studies Purvis…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Sorry about that fellow Barton.. .one who
got killed at the Sherone Apartments. Is he getting to Purvis?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Newspaper said you found him alive. It’s
the eyes, ain’t it? They look at you right before they go. Then they
drift into nothing. Keep you up nights.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: What keeps you up, nights, Mr. Dillinger?
Now Dillinger reads him like an X-ray.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You act like a confident man, Purvis. Bu
_, I don’t see it. You know a few things. You’re probably okay when
there’s a group° of you got the other guy outnumbered. But death and
mayhem up close? I am used to that and you are not, are you? When it’s
toe to toe, “One of us will die right here, right now,” I don’t think
you got the get up and go. Purvis has nothing to say. He stares at
Dillinger. Then he turns to leave.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Dillinger.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’ll see you down the road. From ten feet
away.</p>
<p>****: No you wont. The only way you’ll leave a jail cell is when we
take you out to execute you.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Oh, yeah? We will see about that.</p>
<p>****: Go get yourself another line of work, Melvin. Purvis gestures
for the guards to let him out – Dillinger lays back down on his cot. The
Tucson Deputies stare after Purvis, one laughs. After a moment…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I was joking about the “we’ll see about
that.” I’ll let you boys keep me in this jail awhile.</p>
<p><strong>cop eyman</strong>: We’d like that, Johnny, but don’t get too
comfortable. They’re moving you.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: `Where to?</p>
<p><strong>cop eyman</strong>: ’Indiana.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: why? I have absolutely nothing I want to
do in Indiana.</p>
<p><strong>gear - night</strong>: descends. Its 6:10pm on a snowy
Tuesday evening, January 30th. Below are dim jeweled street lights in
the dark white snow of the city.</p>
<p><strong>as dillinger descends the airplane stairs</strong>:
FLASHBULBS POP. Lake County, Indiana PROSECUTOR ROBERT ESTILL puts
Dillinger’s jacket over him to guard against the cold. Two huge Chicago
cops put Dillinger into the back of a car. With outrider motorcycles,
the caravan takes off out of the airport into the snowy night.</p>
<p><strong>- sheriff lillian holley - night</strong>: at her desk
when.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: He’s here. A diminutive woman, SHERIFF
HOLLEY goes to greet the massive cops who bring John Dillinger into her
reception area and its crowd of 30 reporters.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff holley</strong>: Back up over there. Dellinger looks
at the crowd. Per the “Chicago Daily News”His diction was amazing -
better in many instances than that of his interviewers – his poise no
less so… There Was no hint of hardness about him, no evidence save in
the alert presence of armed policemen that he had spent his formative
years in a penitentiary. He had none of the sneer of-the criminal…
Looking at him for the first time.,.heIates as the most amazing specimen
of his kind ever seen outside of wildly imaginative moving picture.”</p>
<p><strong>sheriff holley</strong>: You can take the manacles off of him
now.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Johnny, are you glad to see Indiana again?
Dillinger’s slow charismatic smile…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: About as glad as Indiana is to see me.
Everybody laughs.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Did you smuggle the guns into Indiana
State Penitentiary for the big break of September 26th?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: How’d you get them in?</p>
<p>****: Right there, you’re too inquistive…</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Hey Bob… Put your arm around
Dellinger. FLASHBULBS POP. They fluster Estill. Dillinger props his
elbow on the prosecutor’s shoulder and cracks a broad grin. The
Prosecutor complies. They look like old pals.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: When was the last time you were in
Mooresville?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Ten years ago. I was a boy and foolish. I
held up a grocery store which I never shoulda done cause Mr. Morgan was
a good man. And they sentenced me to 10 years in the state penitentiary
for a 50 dollar theft. In prison, I met a lot of good -t las. I helped
fix up the break at “f chigan City. Why not? I stick to my friends and
they stick to me.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger’s eyes</strong>: SEE him work the reporters. He
knows that they are sympathetic. He plays them like a champ. The New
York Times called this moment… “a modern version of the return of the
prodigal son.”</p>
<p><strong>another reporter</strong>: How long does it take you to go
through a bank?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: One minute and 40 seconds flat. Dillinger
nods and turns away. He - not the Sheriff - ends the press
conference.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. fbi office - newspaper picture: prosecutor
estill</strong>: with his buddy, John Dillinger resting an arm on his
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Why is this clown Estill fraternizing with
the man he is scheduled to prosecute?! REVEAL we are in Hoover’s
office.</p>
<p><strong>day</strong>: LOUIS PIQUETT - a former bartender and Chicago
gangland’s melodramatic mouthpiece - is escorted to the cellblock by
jailor LEWIS BAKER.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You come highly recommended by Alvin
Karpis. What can you do for me?</p>
<p><strong>piquett</strong>: What’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: The electric chair. There’s none of Dil
linger’s cocky joie de vivre. Thaw-’s for reporters.</p>
<p><strong>piquett</strong>: Your honor! Are we to have a hearing in
accord with the laws of this nation, or is the State to be permitted to
incite an atmosphere of prejudice? The very air reeks with the bloody
rancor of intolerant malice. The clanging of shackles brings to our
minds the dungeons of the Czars, not the flag-bedecked liberty of an
American courtroom. I request the court to direct that those shackles be
removed forthwith!</p>
<p><strong>robert estill</strong>: This is a very dangerous man, your
Honor.</p>
<p><strong>deputy holley</strong>: And I’m responsible for the
safeguarding of the prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>p iquett</strong>: Who are you?! Are you a lawyer? What right
have you to address this court?</p>
<p><strong>judge murray</strong>: Alright, remove the handcuffs from the
prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>robert estill</strong>: Your honor, we’d like to relocate the
prisoner. Only Indiana State Prison in Michigan city can guarantee
Dillinger will not escape.</p>
<p><strong>judge murray</strong>: Sheriff Holley?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff holley</strong>: I concur, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>piquett</strong>: Sheriff Holley, I think it’s a very nice
jail you have right here. What makes you think there’s anything wrong
with it?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff holley</strong>: There isn’t anything wrong with my
jail! It’s the strongest jail in Indiana.</p>
<p><strong>piquett</strong>: That’s what I thought. But of course, I
don’t want to embarrass Mrs. Holley. I appreciate that she’s a woman and
if she’s afraid of an escape…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff holley</strong>: I’m not afraid of an escape. I can
take care of John Dillinger or any other prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>judge murray</strong>: Okay, Dillinger will stay here.
Dillinger’s staying in crown Point. Dillinger’s relieved.</p>
<p><strong>piquett</strong>: Thank you, your Honor. The Defense will
need four months to prepare itself.</p>
<p><strong>robert estill</strong>: It should take 10 days.</p>
<p><strong>piquett</strong>: To go on trial in 10 days would be a legal
lynching of this lad! There’s a law against lynching!</p>
<p><strong>robert estill</strong>: There’s a law against murder!</p>
<p><strong>piquett</strong>: Then observe the law part. Or just stand
Dillinger against the wall and shoot him. Then, there’s no need to throw
away the State’s money on this mockery.</p>
<p><strong>judge murray</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>piquett</strong>: I apologize to the court. Bob and I respect
each other very much.</p>
<p><strong>judge murray</strong>: Watch out or he’ll be putting his arm
around you, too. Laughter ripples.</p>
<p><strong>judge murray</strong>: The trial starts in one month on March
12th. DILLINGER as he stands, handcuffs are reapplied. He leans to
Piquett, whispers.,.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Atta boy, counsel.</p>
<p><strong>e/i. lake county jail - morning</strong>: SAM CAHOON,, a
64-year-old janitor, trots through the rain and into the jail. He shakes
the rain from his coat, waves to a GUARD and passes through to the</p>
<p><strong>corridor</strong>: It runs the length of the jail. At the far
end is the barred door to the criminal cell block.</p>
<p><strong>cahoon</strong>: Bryant! GUARD BRYANT pulls a lever, opening
the cells in the cell block. Dillinger and 14 PRISONERS step out of
their cells, free to roam the corridor behind the barred cell-block
door. Cahoon and TWO TRUSTEES, carrying boxes of toilet paper, soap and
Dutch cleanser, enter. Dillinger jabs something in Cahoon’s belly.
Cahoon gets a glimpse: it’s a small black gun.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: -Cpme on, Sam, we’re going places. A
hulking black prisoner, HERBERT YOUNGBLOOD, holding a length of ipe,
materializes next to Dellinger and ushers Bryant and the Trustees into
an empty cell. Youngblood pulls the lever, locking the cells.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Boys, get in there. Dillinger, Youngblood
and Cahoon set off down the corridor.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Call the warden.</p>
<p><strong>cahoon</strong>: Warden! Warden? Come on back! Warden LEW
BAKER emerges from the office. Dillinger raises the gun.</p>
<p><strong>warden baker</strong>: That ain’t real.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Anything you say.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Dellinger grabs him by the shirt, spins
him round and jams it under his chin.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: No one move or I’ll plug the warden.
Dillinger grabs two Tommy guns. Youngblood starts tying up their
prisoners. Baker stares at Dillinger’s pistol.</p>
<p><strong>warden baker</strong>: I was right, wasn’t I? It’s not
real.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Alright, which of these here cars is the
fastest, and you’re going with, so don’t… lie.</p>
<p><strong>saager</strong>: That would be the Ford in the corner. It’s
got the new V-8.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: We’re taking that.</p>
<p>****: That’s Sheriff Lillian Holley’s personal car. That even more
highly recommends it. Dillinger starts ripping ignition wires out of the
other cars. Dillinger, Youngblood, Deputy Sheriff Blunk, and Saager are
herded into the Sheriff’s Ford V-8.</p>
<p><strong>youngblood</strong>: We got a car following.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Youngblood shoves the Thompson out the
window and fires some rounds. Meanwhile, Dillinger floors it, The V-8
roars, rockets them ahead.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Wow. Mr. Youngblood, are we clear
now?</p>
<p><strong>youngblood</strong>: We are.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: okay, folks. Dillinger checks his
rearview mirror, then the speedometer. He’s impressed.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’m going to write to Henry Ford. “Dear
Henry Ford, Your 1934 Ford is the best damned getaway car in America.
Yours -truly, John Dillinger.” Relax folks… Dillinger ajoys the speed.
He starts to hum. Then…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Okay. Who knows The Last Round-up?”</p>
<p>****: “Get along little doggie, get along..”</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: How did he act?</p>
<p><strong>deputy sheriff slunk</strong>: Well…he sang part of the
way.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What did he sing?</p>
<p><strong>deputy sheriff slunk</strong>: You know The Last
Round-up.”</p>
<p>****: “Get along little doggie, get along…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: As John Dillinger escaped from the Crown
Point jail …or as folks now call it, the “Clown Point Jail”…he appears
immune to the forces of law. And commenting in his fireside address on
March 5th, 1933…</p>
<p><strong>fdr</strong>: The Federal government, you know, cannot be
held up to mockery in this way… Hoover is rocked. It’s as if FDR is
saying Hoover is the man responsible for the federal government being
mocked…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Meanwhile, the Emperor Haile Selassie.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: watches cars, people, then.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: It’s me, Baby.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I can’t talk long. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Don’t come to Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I promised I’d look after you, didn’t
I?</p>
<p><strong>tnt. walgreen’s drug store - dillinger</strong>: Intercut
Dillinger and Billie.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: And you believe me, don’t you? You know I
will look after you.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Say it. Say you know it.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Don’t come to Chicago, Johnnie.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Say it.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: know you will look after me.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: love you, Baby. Dillinger ends the call.
Hamilton waits in a Hudson at the curb.</p>
<p><strong>building - on purvis</strong>: With Baum.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: She knows we’re watching and he knows we’re
listening.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Hiya Sport.</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: How’re ya doin’ Mr. Johnny? You gotta hold it
right there… Where’s the warm welcome…?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Where’s Carole?</p>
<p><strong>sport</strong>: They got moved to Newport, Kentucky.</p>
<p>****: Can’t stay here no more, Mr. Johnny. The smile falls off
Dillinger’s face.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Says who?</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: Sport’s only following orders. So am I.
He demonstrates that his palms are empty. He’s smart enough not to be
armed.</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: They thought you might come here.
Zarkovich is nervous. Dillinger reaches for his front pocket.</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: Your money is no good.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: You go talk to your pal, Gilbert.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: Talk to Gilbert Catena. Dillinger, not
taking his eyes off windows and doors, backs away. He knows there are
more men. Zarkovich is nervous and frozen because…</p>
<p><strong>red hamilton’s</strong>: front sight rests on Zarkovich’s
heart which he would blow out the back of his chest with the souped-up
351 Winchester. Now, Dillinger pulls the ’34 Ford out of the backyard
with Red still on the running board. Zarkovich almost faints in
relief.</p>
<p><strong>front door;.:.:- dillinger</strong>: on the bel,:, ,A
worn-looking woman answers. She is HARRIET</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: We’re looking for Oscar…is he home?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieboldt</strong>: I’m Mrs. Lieboldt. And he ain’t home.
He’s dead. Johnny glances at Red.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I sure am sorry, ma’am. Was it an.
accident?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieboldt</strong>: He accidentally got in the way of a
shotgun when it was going off. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Oscar had “tools” of mine, he was
repairing them.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lieboldt</strong>: Everything that was here? Those
people took it all away. It ain’t here no more.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I went to East Chicago to lay low. The
welcome mat was not out. And I kept hearing your name.</p>
<p>****: Then at Oscar’s, my gear is gone. The deadly look in
Dillinger’s eyes leaves no mistake.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I am going to ask you once.</p>
<p>****: And I just did.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Let me make a telephone call. Dillinger
nods.</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: Gimme Phil…</p>
<p>****: He’s downstairs. He hangs up. He gestures to a doorway and
stairs leading to the second floor. Johnny and Red throw Gilbert up the
stairs first.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: come forward to frisk Johnny + Red. They
gesture for them to open their coats to allow the search.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: Anybody see him come in?</p>
<p><strong>gilbert</strong>: I don’t think so. SOLDIER ONE. Dillinger
turns the man, slams a knee into his kidney, pulls him back off balance,
holds him up with one 45 under his jaw, as he draws the second 45 and
sweeps the group…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Wanna know if we’re armed? Were armed. He
dumps this guy on his ass, his heavy shoe an ounce from crushing his
larynx. Red’s two Thompsons concealed on shoulder straps are out from
under his coat. Frozen time. Phil D’Andrea sits on the corner of a
table. Only he stays relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: k around, Johnny. What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>1 1 dillinger</strong>: A`lot of telephones.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: You see money. Before last month there
were independent wire services letting bookies know who won the third
race at Sportman’s Park. 300 of ’em. Now there’s only one. Ours. General
News. Nationwide. On October20, you robbed the bank in Green Castle,
Indiana. You got away with $74,802. Split 5 ways, that’s $14,960.40. You
probably thought that was a big score. Dillinger stares at him. Where’s
this going?</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: This room makes that much every day. That
is how money gets made. And it keeps getting made, day after day after
day. It is a river of money. Flowing right to us. And it gets deeper and
it gets wider.</p>
<p>****: Unless the cops come through that door.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: But they won’t.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: That’s right. We pay them not to. Unless
they know you’re here. Then they come through the door, no matter
what.</p>
<p>****: What does that tell you?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’m popular.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: You’re bad for business. What this is, is
called obsolescence.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: So the Syndicate got a new policy,
Johnny.</p>
<p>****: Guys like you? We ain’t laundering your money or bonds no more.
You ain’t holing up in our whorehouses anymore. No armorers. No doctors.
No nothing.</p>
<p>****: That’s the way it is. D’Andrea comes closer to him.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: And I am a messenger. This is
business.</p>
<p>****: Between us… He reaches into a pocket for cash.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: You need something to tide you by in case
you’re short? Dillinger and Red’s looks say it all. They start out.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: Okay-but can you do me a personal favor?
Dillinger hesitates.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: For my son, Mark. You’re his hero.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: D’Andrea pulls out piece of paper and a
pen. Dillinger looks at him like he’s crazy. Then he signs the
autograph.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea.</strong>: Good luck to you. You too, Red.</p>
<p><strong>tnt. cigar store - dillinger + hamilton</strong>: cross
through.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Why’d you sign that asshole’s paper?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>waiting. he now joins hoover + suydam</strong>: who are
briskly exiting the building. Hoover’s angry. His voice is clipped and
rapid-fire.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: …they call Crown Point, “Clown Point.”
,,.,The Bureau of Investigation cannot catch ““Public Enemy No. 1, but
Arizona cowboys z�. The President of the United States -s’aid Dillinger
is making a mockery of the system of justice in this country. That means
I am allowing Dillinger to make a mockery of the system of justice in
this country. It is a dark cloud. There is a silver lining in that
cloud. By escaping, John Dillinger has given us a second chance to get
John Dillinger.</p>
<p>****: Hamilton has a 17 year old sister in Detroit. Arrest her. Dump
her in the tank. Pick up all known Dillinger associates. Doctors.
Question family members. Pierpont’s mother in Indianapolis. Dillinger’s
family in Mooresville. Foreigners. We suspect all of them of
harboring…</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Hamilton’s family hasn’t had word from him
in years …</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: That’s the point. Motivate them to get
“word.” Create informants, Agent Purvis.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: I want suspects interrogated “vigorously.”
“Grilled.” No misplaced sentimentality. As they say in Italy and
elsewhere these days…“take off the white gloves.” By this point, they’re
down the Justice Department staircase. Purvis is dismissed. Hoover steps
in front of a…</p>
<p><strong>movietone news crew</strong>: where 35 boys, aged 12-15 have
been waiting in a line. High voltage enthusiasm suddenly imbues
Hoover.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: What’s your name, son?</p>
<p><strong>harris</strong>: Harris. The cameras roll.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: G-Men all over the country have picked up:
the gauntlet flung down by the outlaws and wanton murderers. And these
junior crime fighters, these junior G-men… COLOR DESATURATES into BLACK
+ WHITE. We don’t kno °why.</p>
<p>****: .every one of them., stopped some crime from occurring and
forestalled an entry into the black book of criminal deeds. I am
rewarding them with these medals today. My friend, Harris here, is the
first… Hoover pins the first medal on Harris. And OVER that we HEAR
OFFSCREEN…</p>
<p>****: You can size up a score like nobody’s business, Tommy. You’re a
good egg, but I don’t like Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: cuts to photograph of…</p>
<p><strong>black + white pretty boy floyd,</strong>: bullet-ridden on a
slab in a morgue. And we HEAR..</p>
<p>****: Pretty Boy Floyd. He thought he could lead a life of crime with
impunity… PULL BACK to reveal. .JOHN DILLINGER. We are in…</p>
<p>****: You got Lester wrong. He thinks the world of you. Whole country
thinks you’re a hero. Beyond their on the screen Pretty Boy Floyd`s face
is replaced by Harry P e rpont’s mug shot. Now, SHOUSE,enters and sits
next to Tommy. We haven’t seen him since Johnny threw him out of the car
in Indiana. He holds out his hand…</p>
<p>****: Johnny, willing to let bygones by bygones… Nothing from
Dillinger. On the screen now is Pierpont’s image.</p>
<p>****: Recently convicted of murder in Lima, Ohio and sentenced to die
in the electric chair is John Pierpont…</p>
<p><strong>carroll</strong>: John, we gotta all be friends or this ain’t
gonna work.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Red told you. After we take the bank, we
bust out Pierpont and Makley.</p>
<p><strong>shouse</strong>: They got the prison surrounded by National
Guard…</p>
<p><strong>movie announcer</strong>: And Director J. Edgar Hoover would
like you in the audience to help us apprehend… Public Enemy #1.</p>
<p><strong>now on the screen: john dillinger</strong>: The men
freeze.</p>
<p><strong>movie announcer</strong>: .Dillinger is thought to be in
Indiana or Illinois and has been known to travel with this man. Look
around you, ladies and gentlemen… Red Hamilton’s photo. Shouse tries to
rise. TOMMY slams him back into his seat.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Oh Jesus… Now the LIGHTS come up!</p>
<p><strong>movie announcer</strong>: They may be sitting right next to
you! Turn to your right and turn to your left… Audience turns right and
left. Dillinger and Hamiltn and Tommy turn their heads, too, searching
for desperadoes.</p>
<p><strong>john dillinger</strong>: The exposure is so outrageous it
makes Dillinger laugh out loud. That makes the people all around talk
and joke.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger’s hand</strong>: grips his45. Shouse is grey with
fear. Houselights darken. Finally, Looney Tunes starts. Daffy Duck.</p>
<p>****: After the bank we’ll figure out if we can bust out Pierpont and
Makley…</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Shouse, you step out of line one inch and
and I will kill you. Then I will kill your parents for having had you.
Then I will kill their pet dog.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Where’s the bank?</p>
<p><strong>carroll</strong>: Sioux Falls. Nelson says there’s $800,000
in there. He got us a great place to hole- up after ’til the heat blows
over.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger + red</strong>: walk up the aisle to CAMERA.
Cartoons continue behind them.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: “Don’t work with people you don’t know and
don’t work when you’re desperate.” Walter Dietrich. Remember that?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Walter forgot …when you’re desperate, ’f
iat’s when you got no choice.</p>
<p><strong>- nelson - day</strong>: throws open his overcoat, draws his
Tommy gun and FIRES a burst into the ceiling, bringing down plaster and
light fittings. EMPLOYEES AND CUSTOMERS panic.</p>
<p><strong>baby face nelson</strong>: Everyone on the floor! This is a
hold-up.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You’re turning it into a circus! What the
hell are you doing? Meanwhile, a terrified CLERK presses a button and
the alarm rings loudly outside.</p>
<p>****: I’d like to know who set that alarm off. Who the hell did it?
Who? Dillinger and Red get to the BANK PRESIDENT and shove him towards
the vault. Nelson is working himself into a frenzy. He points his gun at
one terrified Customer after another.</p>
<p><strong>baby face nelson</strong>: If you want to get killed, make a
move. What about you? How about you?</p>
<p><strong>vault</strong>: Its a lot less than $800,000.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Where in the hell’s all the big
money?</p>
<p><strong>outside the bank</strong>: A traffic cop, ROGER POWERS, runs
up. Van Meter surprises and disarms him in classical fashion, but…</p>
<p><strong>lobby</strong>: Through the window Carroll sees a motorcycle
cop, HALE KEITH, arrive outside. Nelson scrambles onto a desk and FIRES
a burst through the plate glass.</p>
<p><strong>baby face nelson</strong>: I got one, I got one! I got a
cop!</p>
<p><strong>vault - on dillinger</strong>: can’t believe this is fucking
HAPPENING.</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: What are you looking at? Nelson FIRES over
their heads. Hostages scream and try to break loose. Nelson advances on
the crowd… Out of a JEWELRY STORE, HARRY BERG, emerges and fires at BABY
FACE NELSON, who is wearing a bullet-proof vest. Nelson sprays the area.
Berg dives back in his store, BYSTANDER, JACOB SOLOMON, is hit in the
stomach and crumples. Delay allows…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He squeezes off a ROUND. The shot hits
Dillinger in the back of the left shoulder and exits his upper arm.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>bang!</strong>: The second shot hits Carroll in the head,
knocking off his hat. Dillinger fires up at the DEPUTY, tries to lift
Carroll, blood gushes from his head. He appears to be dead. Dillinger
leaves him. Sixteen year old, JOE PAWLOWSKI – fueled by adrenaline, runs
across the street and jumps onto Nelson’s back. Nelson, screaming with
rage, throws him through a plate glass window, FIRES two rounds and runs
to join the others – PURE CHAOS. Dillinger throws Nelson in the car.</p>
<p><strong>the hudson</strong>: surges forward. The car proceeds to an
intersection and stops.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: m.on! Shouse cant find his place on
the.git.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Right! Goddamnit! Right! As Shouse makes
the turn…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: How’d you find this place? Dillinger
looks at Wanetka. He’s uneasy. He trusts nothing about it.</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Couple of Chicago guys told Tommy. Don’t
worry, nobody’s gonna find us. He thinks were salesmen.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: How much? Nobody wants to answer.
Hamilton meanwhile uses Atropine sulphate to clean Dillinger’s
wound.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: That would be less than $800,000, right?
Right!</p>
<p><strong>van meter</strong>: Still more than $8,000 a man.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Leave my money and get out. Van Meter,
Nelson and Shouse exit.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: We gotta cut loose from Nelson.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: You need to rest up awhile.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: No. We don’t get out of here in the
morning, we’re going to wind up dead.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: We could head to Reno… Dillinger lies back
in bed, looks around the room, angry and frustrated. Hamilton gets up to
leave…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I need two more guns, Red. OVER we HEAR
the SOUND OF SOMEONE SCREAMING and CALLING OUT –</p>
<p><strong>were acutely aware of purvis.</strong>: Uncomfortable, Purvis
stands apart from the others. Agents Rorer and Clegg are by the
bedside.</p>
<p><strong>carroll</strong>: Gimme the shot, Doc. Please. I’m begging
you.</p>
<p><strong>rorer</strong>: Not until you tell us! As the pressure inside
his skull becomes unbearable –</p>
<p><strong>carroll</strong>: Oh, Mother! Help me! Please, God! He begins
to scream. It is harrowing. A DOCTOR hurries into the room, Purvis
blocks him from the patient. He shoves him back out the door and follows
him…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: T h e bullet entered the back of his head.
It is resting over his right eye. His brain is swelling. He will be dead
soon. He is suffering and I need to sedate him.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Not yet. If you interfere, I’ll arrest you.
From inside.</p>
<p><strong>rorer</strong>: Where is he?!</p>
<p><strong>carroll</strong>: Give me a shot!</p>
<p><strong>rorer</strong>: Di.llinger! Then you get the shot! Where is
he? The Doctor looks at Purvis. Purvis remains steadfast. But we see
Purvis struggling with this. Maybe his soul has just gone to hell.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Rorer hovers over Tommy Carroll. He
blocks our view but his hands press down onto Carroll’s skull.
Screaming. The Doctor walks away. He will not be a witness to torture.
More screaming.</p>
<p><strong>close on purvis</strong>: looks up to see Rorer looking at
him. Rorer is sweating. He nods. He has an answer.</p>
<p><strong>rorer</strong>: .place is called Little Bohemia in
Manitowish, Wisconsin.</p>
<p><strong>purv i s</strong>: What’s the nearest airport to
Manitowish?</p>
<p><strong>rorer</strong>: Rhinelander.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Our group will fly down in the plane. Sam,
you drive up.</p>
<p>****: Little Bohemia. Manitowish, Wisconsin.</p>
<p><strong>the courtyard</strong>: fifteen feet below, which is lit up.
Dillinger positions a Winchester..351 autoloader next to the window.
Moves stiffly across the room to the other window…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Dillinger positions a Thompson on the
window sill. Then he turns on the radio and tries to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: If you can get Dillinger alive, do it. If
not, then you put him down. Rice, Rorer - take the back. Carter, you cut
through the woods and come up on the front from the northwest. Get up
close enough to see if they’re in the barroom.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: If he is?</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: We know where he is. We go in.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: If he isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: o in anyway.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: Too much real estate out here. Too many
ways for’em to get out. And too few of us to blockade ’em in.</p>
<p>****: We need road-blocks. An assault plan. This ain’t how to do it.
We gotta wait for Cowley’s group… Purvis hesitates. Then.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: I will not risk them escaping and
humiliating us. Take the southwest corner. Cover that and the front.
Block the road we came up – Winstead has to accept this. He is not
happy. Baum moves off through the woods. As Winstead and Hurt start to
move off…</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Stop that car! Federal Agents!</p>
<p><strong>carter baum</strong>: in the woods sees the armed man framed
in the doorwa</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: Bureau of Investigation, nobody move!
Chevrolet slowly starts towards Purvis and the others –</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Police! Stop!</p>
<p>****: Fire! Purvis and from the woods Baum open up. Agents Madala,
and Clegg FIRE as well.</p>
<p><strong>close on chevrolet</strong>: takes hits from the Agents’
tommy guns. Glass shatters, tires explode. It stops, dead.
Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>winstead + hurt</strong>: deeper in the woods, cover the side
windows from where they know gunfire will soon erupt. It DOES as…</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Where the hell is Cowley? Purvis - low -
runs to the Chevrolet, opens the door. The driver and one passenger are
dead. A middle aged, unarmed man steps out. Bullets zing around him. He
promptly sits down on the ground.,, dead drunk. These are not Public
Enemies.</p>
<p><strong>the texans</strong>: UNLOAD only on real targets. Bullets CUT
through the trees.</p>
<p><strong>shadowy figure</strong>: darts from a side door and leaps
over the porch FIRING a Tommy gun. Bullets strike the trees around
Purvis.</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: Someone got out!</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Is it Dillinger?</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: See if you can head him off. Go! Purvis runs
into the woods after the fleeing figure. Carter Baum races off in a
car.</p>
<p><strong>now we see this is dillinger</strong>: running but impeded by
his shoulder wound. Hamilton helps him. In the background, we SEE Van
Meter and Shouse have also bailed out of the house for the beach but
disappear into woods to the RIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger + hamilton</strong>: run along the line of the
lake, but in woods now.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: runs through trees parallel to them but
further away from the water. He catches sight of two figures through the
:trees playing against the water from 100 yards away.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger + hamilton</strong>: move fast. Not much brush to
slow them. Dillinger senses, reacts…</p>
<p><strong>hard charging winstead,</strong>: from 50 yards FIRES his
pump-action 10 gauge shotgun FOUR</p>
<p><strong>dillinger + red</strong>: in a burst of speed, cover behind
heavier trees, which are cratered by the heavy shot. And Dillinger,
never stopping, out the other side, is FIRING his Thompson at Winstead
as.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: rolls forward under the two 5-SHOT
BURSTS from Dillinger and…</p>
<p><strong>slo–mo. winstead’s hands,</strong>: while rolling, feed three
10-gauge rounds into the loading port of his shotgun, .and he rolls
right up onto one knee, bringing the 10 gauge onto the FAST MOVING
glimpses thru trees and he’s FIRING at…</p>
<p><strong>ghosts</strong>: because Dillinger and Red are beneath the
brow of the bank, moving fast, now, and Dillinger reloads as…</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: signals above and behind him. to…</p>
<p><strong>hurt</strong>: who crossed at a higher point on the contoured
landscape, giving the,,-Texans cross fire possibilities, and…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: FIRES – whrthe bank’s cut by a ravine -
exactly where Winstead should be…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger’s pov: nothing</strong>: Winstead’s gone. And
Dillinger knows the level of play has been raised by the addition of
whoever these men are. As he and Red race across the ravine for the high
ground advantage…</p>
<p><strong>hurt fires</strong>: Hamilton’s legs give way. Dillinger
hauls him up, still on run…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You hit, Red?</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: I don’t think so. Dillinger looks at Red’s
shirt. A blood stain blooms just above his belt. It’s bad.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Come on, Red. We can make it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: On the high ground, past rock
outcroppings towards a house. Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>baby face nelson</strong>: who turns and FIRES at Purvis, who
drops behind a. felled tree. Ahead, Nelson sees car lights through the
trees and…</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: I know you bastards wear bulletproof vests,
so I’ll give it to you high and low… Nelson OPENS UP. Baum, hit, manages
to fall out of,-te passenger door and run.</p>
<p><strong>purvi s</strong>: Carter!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Baum’s eyes flicker.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Who was it? Was it Dellinger? Baum shakes
his head a fraction.</p>
<p><strong>baum</strong>: Nelson. Baum’s eyes roll back in his head.
Purvis runs after the car. He dives through the woods to cut it off at a
turn in the road.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Gimme the keys to that car! He tosses
them. Dellinger already has Red inside, starts it and blastsr,…away from
the house. Winstead cjim:bing out of the ravine SEES the car pulling
away. It’s gone. He and Hurt run for the shoreline to get back to…</p>
<p>****: Cease fire! Stop shooting! The shooting stops. There is no
return fire from the lodge. Winstead puts a handkerchief over his nose
and mouth and</p>
<p><strong>e/i. little bohemia lodge - wanetha + nan</strong>: coughing
their lungs out and cowering behind the furniture. No one else is there.
Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Nelson bursts out laughing.</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: You dumb bastards.</p>
<p><strong>homer van meter + ed shouse</strong>: streaked with mud jump
in. Nelson takes off.</p>
<p><strong>cowley</strong>: Who’s that? Cowley slows. The other car
doesn’t. Ahead Cowley slams on the breaks.</p>
<p><strong>madala</strong>: Somebody’s on the road!</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: running towards them, jumps in the
Packard.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Turn it around! .the car…</p>
<p><strong>cowley</strong>: Who was in it?</p>
<p>****: Baby Face Nelson. He killed Carter. Cowley u-turns and
accelerates.</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Who are these birds? He pulls the wheel to
the right.</p>
<p><strong>cowley</strong>: Look out…!</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Let’em have it.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: `’aster, Sam!</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Hit the engine! Nelson spins the wheel to
veer off the highway onto a…</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: Come back here, help me, you son of a bitch!
Homer doesn’t. He’s gone. The Packard hurtles towards him, screeches,
skids sideways, stops!</p>
<p><strong>purvis, cowley + madala</strong>: are out. Purvis FIRES.</p>
<p><strong>van meter</strong>: is cut down right away, hit 14 times.
While…</p>
<p><strong>nelson</strong>: opens up with the Tommy gun, ripping</p>
<p><strong>cowley</strong>: across the chest. As</p>
<p><strong>madala ’ s</strong>: 12-gauge FIRES. Nelson, slammed in the
chest, drops-to his knees, fights on, as…</p>
<p><strong>purvis’</strong>: Thompson and Madala’s second round HIT at
the same time. The 45s and double odd shot tear into Nelson’s chest and
slam him back. Purvis rushes to Cowley…</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Rest quiet and you will be alright, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>cowley</strong>: Call my wife and tell her.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton - day</strong>: is in agony. Dillinger gets in back
beside him. He’s bought medical supplies from a drug store and whisky.
He helps Hamilton to a slug and. some pills.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: Not like you ain’t seen a man die
before.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He puts his bloody hand in
Dillinger’s.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: You gotta let… You gotta let me go,
John.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: And you gotta let Billie go too. Flash of
anger in Dillinger’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>hamilton</strong>: I know… you… never let no one down you
care about. But this… time… you gotta let go… Hamilton desperately
searches
Dillinger<code>s eyes for a response. Hamilton squeezes Dillinger's hand and grimaces in pain. He lets out a'7-</code>gasp.
His grip relaxes. Dillinger looks away… A car pulls in next to his. As
the DRIVER gets out, he happens tc…giance at Dillinger’s car.</p>
<p><strong>driver’s pov: two men</strong>: in the back of a car. One
lying motionless, covered in blood, the other looking dishevelled and
distraught. The Driver turns, restarts his car and pulls quickly
away.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’m sorry to do this to you, Red.
Dillinger empties boxes of lye bought from the pharmacy on Red’s face
and starts shovelling earth on his friend’s body.</p>
<p><strong>1933 chevrolet 2-door coupe</strong>: parked at the curb. Two
men are inside. Silhouettes against steamed windows. They’re waiting,
watching.</p>
<p><strong>extremely close: dillinger’s face</strong>: Impassive. He
knows exactly who they are. He cruises past without glancing and
continues west…</p>
<p><strong>tnt. ashland ave. furnished apartment - billie -
night</strong>: checks her watch., rises past her window to turn on the
radio. Paul Whiteman’s band signs off followed by a Geritol commercial
telling Radiol.and to stay tuned for the Will Rogers commentary.</p>
<p><strong>rorer</strong>: What’s she doing?</p>
<p>****: Listening to the radio…</p>
<p><strong>then: lights</strong>: come on. They stab at her. She can’t
see in the glare.</p>
<p><strong>black hudsowi;pulls through – john dillinger</strong>: opens
the door. She jumps in. He’s already pulling away…</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Agent Cowley died this morning at 5:17am.
Grim reactions among the men.. ,their lost colleagues and friends…</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Right now all of Dillinger’s friends are
dead. He’s out there alone. There won’t be a better chance to run him
down.</p>
<p><strong>rorer</strong>: He could be anywhere - California,
Florida…</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: He could be anywhere - but he is not. What
he wants is right here. Billie Frechette.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Purvis looks up and sees the open door.
Reinecke stands there…a desolate look of failure. Purvis knows what’s
happened. They lost Billie.</p>
<p><strong>will rogers</strong>: Well, they said they were going to get
Public Enemy #1. And they had John Dillinger surrounded… They was all
ready to shoot him as soon as he came out. But a bunch of folks came out
ahead, so they shot all them instead.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: drive carefully, south on Clark St. Sidewalks
are filled with revelers and crowds.</p>
<p><strong>will rogers</strong>: They will get Dillinger someday.
Probably when he’s with a group of innocent bystanders they’re shooting
down, and he’ll get killed by accident…</p>
<p>****: Meanwhile, President Roosevelt got Congress to pass a second
crime Bill…</p>
<p><strong>nitti - evening</strong>: listening to Will Rogers. He’s
sober.</p>
<p><strong>will rogers</strong>: .which the example of Public Enemy
Number One has helped push through Congress. It will make all criminal
enterprise across state lines a federal crime… Nitti’s hand picks up a
telephone and dials. He puts the earpiece next to his ear. And he blows
up.</p>
<p><strong>nitti</strong>: Okie inbred sonsabitches … backwoods
cocksuckers. They did this.</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: Did what?</p>
<p><strong>nitti</strong>: Karpis. That syphilitic idiot Babyface
Nelson. Dillinger. All of them. Another interstate crime bill?!</p>
<p><strong>d’andrea</strong>: What do we care? We don’t rob banks.</p>
<p><strong>nitti</strong>: Everything is interstate. Wake up. That’s the
point of being nationwide. Fix it.</p>
<p><strong>will rogers</strong>: -.-v -so after they missed all the
Public Enemies at Little Bohemia, the Bureau =axrrested their
girlfriends. The FBI may “bat get their man, but they always get his
woman. J. Edgar Hoover does not.</p>
<p><strong>purvis sees: agent madala</strong>: with headphones noting a
conversation on a steno pad. Two stenographers are still around. Each
machine is labeled. Madala listens to “PROBASCO.” Next to him is “AUSTIN
STATE</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Agent Madala… Agent Madala!</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Its New Year’s Eve, Roger. Go home to your
family.</p>
<p><strong>madala</strong>: Thank you sir. Purvis leaves.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Happy New Year, doll.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Happy New Year, baby. He looks at her. Its a
concerned look. She reads his mind.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Johnny. I’d rather live on the run with you,
than live any other way. That says it all. They are both quiet for a
long beat.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: However long.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Next week? Next year? Alvin said this
wasn’t gonna last. He was right. The world has turned. Everything’s
different.</p>
<p>****: And there’s a sweet score. Enough money to go away and stay
away for a long time.</p>
<p>****: So whattya say we lit out of here? Lit out of here,
altogether.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: glows to the prospect. For the first time
there’s a tangible future.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Cuba?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Too close. How about we fly to Caracas
and then to Rio on Pan Am. Then an oanliner to Manila or Singapore. We
are f6reign-looking to them. So they will ,have no idea who the hell we
are. We can go out dancing all night and have a lotta laughs anytime we
want…</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I think that’s a great idea! They drive on
into the pre-dawn of the year 1934.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger - day</strong>: sits in plain view on a chair. His
Thompson rests against the wall. His sister, Audrey, is giving him a
haircut. His father, John Wilson Dillinger, drinks coffee next to him.
The January sunlight is so direct, it’s like Spring.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Not too short on the sides.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: comes out the door. Dillinger’s niece comes
up with a Kodak Brownie.</p>
<p><strong>niece</strong>: Can we take a picture?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Of course. You got an eye on those
federal boys?</p>
<p><strong>nephew</strong>: Yes sir. They’re over having breakfast at
Myra’s Diner. They’ve been hanging around, here, doing nothing for so
long, they just know this is the last place you’re going to show…</p>
<p><strong>closer: billie</strong>: watches Johnny. This is who he would
be if he had not had the troubles in this life, a charismatic young
man.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: That how he was when he was a boy? Carefree
and laughing…?</p>
<p><strong>john sr.</strong>: Not right when his mother died. But
after„- awhile, yes.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: You love him, don’t you? She touches his
arm. He looks back at the house.</p>
<p><strong>john sr.</strong>: He grew up a motherless child… After he
was there he never had a woman’s comfort. So I loved him but didn’t know
how to raise him. And that’s the truth.</p>
<p>****: When he come out of that prison, he had so many worries.
Restless. Bitter. He had a desire to get even. A covey of quail flush
out of the wheat.</p>
<p><strong>john sr.</strong>: Well, now he has gotten even. And he has
seen the country. And he has you. So, he is carefree.</p>
<p>****: But what is next for you and Johnnie?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: To try to live somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>john sr.</strong>: Well, if it goes okay, good. Whatever
happens, he has been my boy. And I have loved him in my heart, always.
Right or wrong, no matter what. He is as straight and truthful as the
land is flat. She takes his hand and they walk through the fields.</p>
<p><strong>billie – day</strong>: in the black Hudson. We’ve entered
mid-scene.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: :Eartender’s name is Larry Streng.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: `–W re ’ s the apartment?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Oakley and Potomac. He’ll give you the
keys. They drive north over the Clark Street Bridge. Dillinger gives her
an envelope.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: 5,000 dollars. It buys us a month, but
we’re not staying that long.</p>
<p><strong>di.llinger’s car - day</strong>: pulls to the curb on the
east side of the street. Billie gets out, walks through the crowds, down
the sidewalk and crosses the street to the bar. MOVE IN on the sign.
This is the location we saw being tapped at the Telephone Exchange.</p>
<p><strong>over dillinger’s shoulder</strong>: watching the distant
front of the tavern into which Billie disappeared. Then…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: run right past Dillinger’s Hudson. They
join 12 more agents flooding into the Austin State Tavern from the other
side.</p>
<p>****: Who brought you? How’d you get here?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: .I took a taxi.</p>
<p><strong>the thompson</strong>: in his lap. He checks his 45.</p>
<p><strong>he sees.. .her</strong>: There she is. Where’s an opening?
His eyes dart.</p>
<p><strong>more chicago police</strong>: arrive. It’s now a sea of
blue.</p>
<p><strong>closer: dillinger</strong>: 20-30 men surround her.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: .hauled towards a Bureau car by Reinecke. He
tips her off balance. He bounces her off the door pillar on purpose.
Dillinger sees all this.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: can do nothing. Tears of frustrated rage
stream down his face. Later, he would say he “cried like a baby.”</p>
<p><strong>reinecke</strong>: If you tell us all about him, maybe you’ll
get a break. Maybe you end up doing a couple of months on a work farm.,
like a girls’ home or something.</p>
<p><strong>another agent</strong>: Where is he? Where were you meeting?
Where were you hiding out?</p>
<p><strong>reinecke</strong>: …or we drop you in a black hole. And you
et to shit and piss on the floor and then lie in it all night in the
dark with the bugs and the rats. Billie’s eve’lids fall. She drifts off.
Reinecke kicks her awake.</p>
<p>****: Where is he?! Billie startles! CLOSER on her chair.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I have to… He kicks the chair again. She’s
being denied a toilet. The humiliation is part of the pressure. Billie’s
embarrassed. Billie urinates on the chair now and the floor. Another
Agent makes a face…</p>
<p><strong>other agent</strong>: What was that movie, “Squaw Girl”…?
Reinecke has gone out to get water for himself.</p>
<p><strong>reinecke</strong>: Lady, you’re stinking up my office. Where
were you supposed to meet him! He slaps her. Billie’s shoulders
collapse.</p>
<p><strong>reinecke</strong>: I can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: We were supposed to meet…at our
apartment…</p>
<p><strong>reinecke</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: On Addison. 1148…</p>
<p><strong>reinecke</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>reverse: the apartment interior</strong>: It is dead empty.
Reinecke looks at the dust on the floor. No one’s been here for a
month.</p>
<p><strong>purvis pov: liane hamilton</strong>: Hamilton’s sister, 17,
stares vacantly from the corner. Bruised, filthy, dress ripped, she’s
among a sordid group of 30 older women: tough hookers, drunks, a couple
of tough dykes in men’s lace-up boots. Liane catches Purvis’ eyes. He
walks on…</p>
<p><strong>reinecke</strong>: Where is he!</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Well… he’s way the hell away from here by
,Tow, isn’t he? She looks up at him. And she drops the little girl act.
She sent them on a wild goose chase to give her man time to get
away.</p>
<p>****: You wanted to know where he is, you dumb flatfoot? You were too
scared to look around. You walked right past him on State Street. He was
at the curb in that black Hudson.</p>
<p>****: You asked me “how I got there?” I told you I took a taxi. And
you believed me?</p>
<p>****: He dropped me off and was waiting for me. And you walked right
past him. He’s furious. Her Native American beauty doesn’t soften
Reinecke. He visualizes smashing the bones in her face with his
fist.</p>
<p><strong>dolores</strong>: Mr. Purvis, you have to stop this. Those
men cannot abuse a woman in that way. Purvis, with Winstead following,
moves to the interrogation room.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: .and when my Johnny finds out how you
slapped around his girl? You know what will happen to you, fatboy? She
looks Reinecke square in the eye. Reinecke swings…</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: grabs his wrist, turns him, Reinecke
resists, Winstead nearly breaks his wrist.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: Bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Uncuff her. Reinecke tries to pull away. He
can’t. The smaller man is built of steel cable. Rorer uncuffs
Billie.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Restroom’s down the hall. Billie tries to
rise. Stumbles.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: I can’t stand utp. Purvis doesn’t hesitate.
He picks her up in his arms and carries her through the office to the
restroom in the corridor. She puts her hand over her eyes in
embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Miss Rogers… Doris Rogers follows them.</p>
<p><strong>day</strong>: in the kitchen, waits. He’s agitated. So is
PROBASCO. Rear door opens. Probasco jumps. In comes Dillinger… Dillinger
throws him an envelope.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: $5,000. You run her down.</p>
<p>****: Lake County jail or Cook County? I want layouts, blueprints.
You visit her. Tell her I’m coming for her. I’ll get her out.</p>
<p><strong>probasco</strong>: You need a car? A place to stay? Wanna
stay here? Is Probasco is trying to lure Dillinger here?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’m fine. I got a place.</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: in a woman’s business suit, hat and
sunglasses in the dark bar, reacts. Zarkovich sits next to her.</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: Immigration say they send me back to
Romania. Zarkovich, the crooked cop, takes Anna’s hand. The 40 year old
madam is the true love of his life.</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: You know what to do. He turns her chin so
that her eyes look right into his.</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: Plus there’s a $25,000 reward.</p>
<p><strong>anna. sage</strong>: We split.</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: O’Neill’s got to be cut in, too. So it
splits three ways.</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: Can they fix the deportation?</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: These guys can fix anything.</p>
<p><strong>low thick branches</strong>: cast a deep pool of dark shadow
concealing Anna Sage.</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: hesitates. Then she approaches and enters
Purvis’ car. It pulls out.</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: I want guarantee.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: If you aid us apprehending John Dillinger, I
will do everything I can to influence Bureau of Immigration to let you
stay in America.</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: No good.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: That’s all there is.</p>
<p>****: I think you do this. I think you tell Immigration. to pick me
up and to send me back to Romania.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: How do you socialize with him?</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: We go out. Maybe tomorrow night. Maybe
not. Maybe in a week. A month. Maybe never.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: I will not guarantee what Immigration will
do. What I can guarantee is what I will do. If you do not cooperate, you
will be on a boat out of this country in 48 hours. Do not play games
with me. Anna hesitates, caves in to Purvis.</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: Every Sunday night, we go out.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Who’s “we”?</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: e. Him. One of my girls, Polly
Hamilton.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: How will we know?</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: I call you Sunday when I know.</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: She’s piayin` ball.</p>
<p><strong>nitti</strong>: Be there. Make sure.</p>
<p><strong>!nt. nitti`s office - frank nitti</strong>: is the co-author
of this betrayal. For a moment Nitti looks regretful.</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: They are plenty serious all on their
own.</p>
<p><strong>nitti</strong>: They’re serious when they make speeches. Then
they screw it up. You make sure.</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>- u.s. mail car - day</strong>: is attached three cars back
from the locomotive.</p>
<p><strong>pullback</strong>: Dillinger and Karpis watch it. Dillinger’s
appearance is different. He’s grown a moustache.</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: The mail will carry the full whack this
Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Why Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: That’s the day they ship two weeks of
payroll for seven large factories around. Rockford. Route 14 and Route
11. Two ways in; two ways out. Harry handles the door and the..::, safe…
WIDEN to include: HARRY CAMPBELL - ruddy face, large bodied. Also here
is Freddie and Dock Barker and Jimmy Prohsco.</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Dock cuts the telephone lines five minutes
before we go. You and Harry and I go in strong. Dock comes down the pole
and becomes the lookout. Jimmie and Freddie drive.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: What do you figure?</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: $1.5 to $1.7 million. About $300,000 each.
Karpis is quiet. They are both feeling the ghosts of their friends…</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Sorry about Red.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Nelson was a hot-head. I liked him for some
reason.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You were in a minority.</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Had a talk with him once, at Czernaky’s…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Yeah? Louis Piquett arrives and Dillinger
interrupts..</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You see her? She okay?</p>
<p><strong>piquett</strong>: Yes. He hands Diilinger a letter. Dillinger
opens it.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Don’t try and break me out. I am too well
guarded. Milan Prison is too tough. Two years is not a long time,
anyway. Go away someplace where you’re safe like Mexico and wait for me.
We will be together again. Your true love in life, Billie. And the air
goes out of him.</p>
<p><strong>piquett</strong>: She told me what was in it. Dillinger’s
distracted …Karpis continues.</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: I reminded him…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Reminded who?</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: Nelson. .that he told me if he ever got
$20,000 together, he’d up and quit forever…</p>
<p>****: After he hit the Janesville bank I said, “Yeah, so…?”</p>
<p>****: He said, “After I started, I couldn’t stop.”</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Well, I can. We do this Tuesday, I’m gone
on Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>karpis</strong>: I thought about heading to Varadero Beach in
Cuba, outside Havana. You been there?</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: For me, it’s maybe Mexico. And that’s the
answer. Dillinger plans to score the train. Go to Mexico. Wait for
Billie.</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: Jimmy, you’re back… We understand that
Dillinger’s been harbored here all along. And he goes under the name
Jimmy Alexander.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: looks through the apartment like he
always does. He goes to the sink and starts running cold. water on his
wrists to cool down.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Tell you what, doll. You and Polly and
me, we’ll go out to a movie tonight and get in the refrigeration. POLLY
HAMILTON enters from a bedroom down the hall, dressed to go out.</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: Where you want to go? Jimmy take us to
the picture show.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: Marbro or the Biograph… Where you
goin’?</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Take the street car downtown to get my
waitressing license.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’ll take you. Its too hot in here.</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: I get us some butter and make fried
chicken for dinner. We SLIDE onto Dillinger with his wrists under the
water. He turns off the tap and starts out…</p>
<p><strong>anna sage</strong>: We go tonight. I don’t know if to Marbro
or to Biograph.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Miss Sage… She hung up.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: It is tonight, Marbro. Or the Biograph…</p>
<p><strong>agent madala</strong>: Biograph’s on Lincoln north of
Fullerton… They’re split…</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: Be right back… REVEAL he is parked right in
front of the Chicago Police station on 11th and State. Sunlight cuts
through the gaps between downtown’s skyscrapers and illuminates
Dillinger. He smiles…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’ll go in with you.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger pov: registry</strong>: “Licenses Examination” is
on the 8th Floor. “Detective Bureau” is on the 6th.</p>
<p><strong>cu: dillinger</strong>: Here, in the belly of the beast. The
lopsided grin behind the dark glasses over the moustache…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: How long will you be?</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: It might take ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: I’ll meet you back here… He waits as she
boards an elevator. As her doors close, Dillinger follows a group of
police, bail bondsmen, and civilian workers into a second elevator.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: heads right for it.</p>
<p><strong>ecu dillinger’s hand</strong>: brushes under his jacket his
.45, checking..</p>
<p><strong>wide - johnny</strong>: enters this section of desks. Shafts
of light illuminate papers. A DETECTIVE we may have seen at Midway
Airport right past him… Wall charts, crime photos from Crown Point, the
American Bank, other banks, Billie, mug shots of all his crew, are
posted on walls. Photos of Dillinger are on desks. It’s as if it was a
shrine to him.</p>
<p><strong>in a corner six or seven detectives</strong>: listen to the
ninth inning of a White Sox game. Three others work through reports in
shirt sleeves. One glances his way. Johnny nods. Detective nods
back.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: crosses thr4gh it all, strolls in the lion’s
den, walks in the belly ;ofthe beast - among the hunters. His audacity
elevates h-,It is triumph. With all their resources, modern
technology”.`and organization, they cannot lay a glove on him. He is
better than they are. His gratification is internal. He leaves behind,
as he exits, a wake of absurdity. He passed through and they didn’t even
know. History was made. Like a ghost, has gone.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: You pass?</p>
<p><strong>polly</strong>: I have to go back. They needed a blood
test.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Is it the Marbro or the Biograph? We will be
deployed at both. Whichever one he shows at, I will be outside that
theater when Dillinger exits. I will give the signal to move in by
lighting a cigar.</p>
<p><strong>zarkovich</strong>: Anna Sage will wear a white blouse over
an orange skirt. That’s how we’re gonna know it’s him.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: What’s playin’?</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: What’s playin’ at the Marbro? What’s
playin’ at the Biograph? It hadn’t occurred to anybody to find that
out.</p>
<p><strong>mandala</strong>: Marbro…a Shirley Temple movie called
“Moptop.” Biograph is playing a gangster-, picture starring Clark Gable.
“Manhattan::: Melodrama.”</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: John Dillinger ain’t going to a Shirley
Temple movie.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Sergeant Zarkovich and Special Agent
Winstead will be at the Biograph. As will I and Special Agent
Madala.</p>
<p>****: Virgil Peterson, coordinate the Marbro. The rest of you will
wait here until it’s determined which theater. Looks between Zarkovich
and Capt. O’Neill. They have to INSURE Dillinger is killed, not
captured.</p>
<p><strong>sopsic</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>cu: purvis</strong>: watches the crowds thin as showtime
nears. He gets out of the car. Is Dillinger a no-show? Another failure?
Another eviscerating memo from Hoover? THREE FIGURES BRUSH PAST HIM. A
woman’s orange skirt. Its Anna Sage, Polly Hamilton, and John Dillinger.
They sweep to the ticket booth, pay, and join latecomers rushing inside
so that they don’t miss the start of the movie.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: is stunned. Dillinger passed three feet from
him.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Johnny and Polly sit three rows from the
screen.”Manhattan Melodrama,” starring Clark Gable, William Powell, and
Myrna Loy begins.</p>
<p><strong>ticketseller lady</strong>: The movie runs an hour and 34
minutes and it started about 3 minutes ago so that means it will all be
over in an hour,</p>
<p><strong>agent brown</strong>: They’re on their way over here from the
Marbro.</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: District Attorney listens to his
secretary. She is against her boss inviting gangster Blackie Gallagher ,
his childhood friend, to his wedding…</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Remember what happened to that District
Attorney in the Midwest. Just for having his picture taken with some
gangster…?, The movie is referring to John Di.llinger’s Crown Point
photo session with his arm around Prosecutor Robert Estill.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: laughs out loud. The irony is that the
gangster who inspired this Hollywood moment is sitting right here
watching this movie.</p>
<p>****: Clarence and I are going to be in that doorway.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: 30 feet south of the theater entrance.
Gerry, you get in that car at the curb about 75 feet north…</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: In case he walks north?</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: He ain’t gonna head north. He’s gonna walk
south and cut through that alley back to her place. Gerry, when you spot
him through your rearview-you come up on him from behind. The “cowboys”
are the only men not deployed by Purvis. They call their own shots.</p>
<p><strong>closer: a rear door</strong>: from the basfement opens. A
trash can is put out by a JANITOR. He sees the=two groups of men in the
alley and quickly closes the door. INT. MANAGk’S OFFICE - JANITOR
enters.</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: They’re comin’ to stick us up again. He’s
talking to CHARLIE SHAPIRO, the Essaness theater manager.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>janitor</strong>: In the alley…</p>
<p>****: Irene. Anything strange?</p>
<p>****: There’s a sweaty little man that keeps asking when the movie’s
gonna end… across the street, there’s three, four men and there’s two
more around the corner-why are they wearing suitcoats on such a hot
night?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Pretend like nothing’s going on… He leaves
the booth, taking the cash receipts.</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant’s voice</strong>: District 37, Sheffield
Avenue…</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Get some detectives over here, this is
Charlie Shapiro at the Biograph. They’re gonna stick us up again…</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant’s voice</strong>: How do you know, Charlie?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I see them getting in position, like
they’re waiting ’til the movie’s over…</p>
<p><strong>suran</strong>: Wait, wait…! Hold it! Federal Agent!</p>
<p><strong>chicago p.d. driver/sgt.</strong>: Before you shoot him, get
his I.D.</p>
<p><strong>chicago p.d. detective</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>sub n</strong>: Department of Justice. Bureau of
Investigation!</p>
<p><strong>chicago p.d. detective</strong>: What do you think you’re
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>suran</strong>: Were on a federal stakeout! Put that gun down
and back those cars out of the alley. But stay close because we may need
you.</p>
<p><strong>chicago p.d. detective</strong>: You may need us?” Fuck you,
college boy. Let’s see your goddamn badge! Suran’s looking down both
barrels.</p>
<p><strong>myrna loy</strong>: I love you more than anything, Blackie,
you know…? She stops.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger’s</strong>: mesmerized’ her eyes and soft skin. We
SEE in his hyper reality thee satin tones on the screen. Myrna Loy’s
insouciance,;like Billies, speaks to him. Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>sopsic + stretch</strong>: empty their pockets, trying to
identify themselves to TWO HUGE CHICAGO P.D. DETECTIVE who’ve drawn down
on them. Zarkovich starts arguing, not believing this is happening. More
Chicago PD arrive. Meanwhile…</p>
<p><strong>john dillinger</strong>: the actual Public Enemy #1 watches
the celluloid gangster walk to the electric chair…</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: See ya, Blackie.</p>
<p><strong>clark gable</strong>: stops at the cell.</p>
<p><strong>clark gable</strong>: Die the way you lived. All of a
sudden.</p>
<p><strong>ecu: dillinger’s eyes</strong>: startle, Is this a
message?</p>
<p><strong>clark gable</strong>: Don’t drag it out.</p>
<p><strong>grain structure of the face of gable</strong>: speaking these
important words…</p>
<p><strong>clark gable</strong>: .that doesn’t count for anything.
There’s no more point to it.</p>
<p><strong>cu: dillinger</strong>: He sees inwards. And he knows it
won’t happen. Them=E no Mexico with Billie. There’s no freighter to
Manila.- He will die. This day, this month, next month. He knows that in
this instant.</p>
<p><strong>john dillinger. looking up at the screen.</strong>: In this
Hollywood version of life, the power of cause and effect operates on the
end, as inescapably as gravity. It’s a core truth. This is the only end
for Blackie Gallagher. And its as true for john Dillinger in his life as
it is for Gallagher. Actions and historical forces have made his time be
up. Dillinger SLOWS the flickering images. His concentration slices time
into component parts. Gable exchanges last good- byes. He warns his D.A.
friend, Ronald Coleman, not to commute his sentence. The images play on
Dillinger’s face. They take him over-alone in the packed theater while
25 Federal Agents and five East Chicago cops wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: enters the execution chamber.</p>
<p><strong>convict</strong>: There he goes. They’re giving it to him
now.</p>
<p><strong>cu: john dillinger</strong>: The grin. End title music.
People stirring. The house lights come up. Johnny doesn’t move. He seems
liberated. Released somehow. People in front and behind him start to
exit. He sits there, holding onto his thoughts for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: sees him. He lights his cigar. It’s the
signal to move in.</p>
<p><strong>across the street: richmond + zarkoetich</strong>: don’t see
the signal because the Chicago P.D. detective is now shouting at
Zarkovich.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: lights a second match. And as he lights his
cigar, he looks up to see…</p>
<p><strong>john dillinger</strong>: look right at him. BUT Dillinger
does not recognize Purvis.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger, polly + anna</strong>: turn left at the sidewalk
heading south, like Winst”ad said. They pass doorways. Reinecke
approaches from 20 feet behind.</p>
<p><strong>across the street: zarkovich</strong>: looks up… sees
Dillinger walking away. If Dillinger’s taken alive, he’s dead. The
Chicago cop puts a hand on Zarkovich`s chest…</p>
<p><strong>rear shot: polly, dillinger + anna sage</strong>: down the
sidewalk past shadowed doorways.</p>
<p>****: That’s Dillinger. Straw hat. Glasses. Hurt crosses the sidewalk
in front of Dillinger and walks north. He’ll turn and position himself
behind Dillinger on the right. These guys are pros.</p>
<p><strong>e.x.t. bakery steps - zarkovich</strong>: shoves the Chicago
Sergeant out of his way and races across the street…</p>
<p><strong>ecu: reinecke</strong>: draws his weapon. He stares at the
back of Dillinger’s head. Has getting closer. Sweat runs into Reinecke’s
eyes. This isn’t the firing range with a paper target. This isn’t
theory. This is the beast. The beast is a gunfighter. The beast is
better than you. You beat-up his girl. Your shot will miss…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger in large profile</strong>: now passerWinstead in
the doorway. Purvis is raising his 9mm Browning. Reinecke stalls. He
doesn’t want to be first.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: steps out f, the doorway, now, and falls
in up the center of the sidewalk. Reinecke’s eyes are riveted on
Dillinger…</p>
<p><strong>and john dillinger</strong>: senses something.</p>
<p><strong>rear shot: dillinger’s neck + head in slo-motion</strong>:
Subconsciously his brain processes what his peripheral vision took in
that his intuitive defenses don’t like about this landscape. He
turns…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger sees reinecke</strong>: Reinecke’s hand holding the
gun is frozen in the air. He’s paralyzed. He lacks the power to pull the
trigger.</p>
<p><strong>dillinger’s eyes</strong>: There’s the man who slammed Billie
into that car. Dillinger’s lethal intent focuses on this one target. In
milliseconds…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: turning towards Reinecke. Reinecke has
hijacked his attention. Dillinger hasn’t picked up the others.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: pulls the trigger. Nothing. He left the
safety on. He fumbles with it.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: H–halt!</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: sees all of them RIGHT NOW. He pushes the
.380 in SLOWED TIME towards Purvis.. .and bumps into a pedestrian named
Ella Natasky.</p>
<p><strong>ella natasky</strong>: starts to fall. Dillinger turns his
attention to her for a millisecond. He’s a gentleman. His impulse is to
reach for her to steady her…</p>
<p><strong>charles winstead</strong>: shoves aside the paralyzed
Reinecke, pushes past Purvis, leans forward and shoots John Dillinger in
the back of the head. The heavy 45 round punches through
Dillinger’s,brain stem and exits underneath his right eye. John
Dillinger stumbles into the alley opening and starts to fall. A second
shot from Winstead and two more from Clarence Hurt hit him now. They
don’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>john dillinger</strong>: falls through the air.</p>
<p><strong>face</strong>: crashes into the FRAME. One lens of his
eyeglasses breaks. The brim of his straw hat snaps. The hat falls away.
He struggles, but can’t move. He breathes. He tries to speak..</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: stands over him. Purvis snatches the .380
automatic out of Dillinger’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>.winstead</strong>: sees Dillinger’s trying to say
something.</p>
<p><strong>johnny’s lips</strong>: try to form speech and Winstead’s ear
is next to his mouth. We and Winstead hear…</p>
<p><strong>dillinger</strong>: .tell Billie… Only Charles Winstead hears
the rest.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: unloads Dillinger’s gun. His gun-handling of
Dillinger’s gun is a lot better than his gun-handling of his own under
stress.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: I couldn’t hear him.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: You look after this. I need to call
Washington. Zarkovich`houlders through the gathering crowd of</p>
<p><strong>pedestrian</strong>: s=and newsmen, sees the head wound, the
glazing over of Diflinger’s eyes. He knows he’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>john dillinger’s eyes</strong>: get dreamy, then they seem to
focus far away. Then they seem to focus not at all.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Cover his face and keep the damn
photographers away.</p>
<p><strong>aerial: lincoln avenue</strong>: Purvis starts away and we
SEE the Biograph marquee, the trolley tracks in the cobblestone street,
the alley, and the hundreds of people moving towards the locus of the
dead John Dillinger.</p>
<p><strong>another day</strong>: watches Tolson who is at the window.
Tolson gets a sign. Hoover straightens his collar. He brushes lint off
his pants leg. Tolson waits. Hoover waits.</p>
<p><strong>the man is charles winstead</strong>: The newspaper hides a
sawn-off, 10 gauge Winchester lever action shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>alvin looks to his left: clarence hurt</strong>: leans on a
lamp post. His body hides a 351 Winchester rifle.</p>
<p><strong>now alvin karpis</strong>: freezes. He doesn’t hesitate. He
opens his hands to demonstrate he is holding nothing and lets his
jacket; fall to the ground. He knows instantly who they are and
that.,,they intend to kill him. Karpis’ eyes dart to the roofto is°.
Snipers on both. In this instant, Karpis knows he is done. One objective
races into his mind: stay alive.</p>
<p><strong>karpis’</strong>: stretches out his arms, wide. Winstead has
dropped the newspaper. The sawed-off 10 gauge is aimed squarely at
Alvin’s chest. Karpis is displaying he is unarmed. Winstead approaches
warily step-by-step. His weapon would cut Alvin in half. Clarence, the
rifle at his shoulder, inches forward. The ex-Texas Ranger gunfighters
with real trigger-time have taken Alvin Karpis.</p>
<p><strong>alvin karpis</strong>: I am unarmed.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: Don’t even breathe sudden.</p>
<p><strong>winstead ± campbell + hurt</strong>: are 10 feet from him.
Clarence pats him down. Karpis is clean.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The Texans cover Alvin and move him to
the sidewalk near his car.</p>
<p><strong>hurt</strong>: Put your hands on the roof of that Lincoln.
Other agents come running in. Someone’s yelling: We got him! We got him.
Bring him in.” While they wait…</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: Where you from?</p>
<p><strong>alvin karpis</strong>: Canada, but mostly Chicago. You?</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: Fort Worth, thereabouts. Clarence is from
Tyler.</p>
<p>****: Well, Alvin. You’re a sly old dog. If ,you’d a even had that
jacket on… A ring ofc tints with their revolvers out, now converge
around Karpis.</p>
<p><strong>hurt</strong>: Any handcuffs around here? They don’t have
any. They had not planned on needing them. One agent is excited. His gun
pointed at Karpis shakes.</p>
<p><strong>al v i n karp i s</strong>: Mind asking that man to…</p>
<p><strong>hurt</strong>: Put that down. The agent drops his gun.</p>
<p>****: “You are under…</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: You are under arrest for the…Wahpeton, South
Dakota bank robbery. Tolson waves to an agent across the street.</p>
<p><strong>wide on the corner: reporters + photographers</strong>: are
now released and rush towards us.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: regains his composure.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: I heard of your fishing prowess. i myself,
always wanted, to catch a marlin…</p>
<p><strong>alvin karpis</strong>: You’re thinking of my partner, Harry
Campbell.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Are you relieved its over? I’m sure you
are.</p>
<p>****: You know you will feel much better once you get everything off
your chest.</p>
<p>****: Why don’t you tell me where Harry Campbell is? After a
moment..</p>
<p><strong>alvin karpis</strong>: Who do you think you’re talking to?
Hoover is silent.</p>
<p><strong>special agent</strong>: There’s no handcuffs.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: Give me your tie.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hoover separates from Karpis.</p>
<p><strong>newsmen</strong>: Mr. Hoover! Director!</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Karpis said he’d never be taken alive, but I
took him without firing a shot.</p>
<p>****: That marks him as a yellow rat. He was scared to death when I
arrested him.</p>
<p>****: That’s all I got to say. Suydam and the special publicist,
COURTNEY COOPER address the reporters.</p>
<p><strong>suydam</strong>: I’ll answer any questions.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Mr. Hoover captured Karpis?</p>
<p><strong>suydam</strong>: Mr. Hoover personally placed Alvin Karpis =
eier arrest today. Karpis reached for a rzf le, but the Director was too
fast.</p>
<p><strong>tolson</strong>: The Director will see you now.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: Agent Purvis.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>hoover</strong>: A medical student in the morgue made that
cast of Dillinger’s face. It’s a reminder of the war we continue to wage
against the punks and hoodlums… Purvis looks at Hoover. This was the
golden boy who Hoover came to despise.</p>
<p><strong>purvis</strong>: One thing I learned was that John Dillinger
was an outlaw and my Adversary. But he was no punk. And he was no
hoodlum.</p>
<p>****: Another is that I have no future in your Bureau. And I don’t
desire one. I quit. Purvis tosses his badge on Hoover’s desk and walks
out. Hoover couldn’t care less.</p>
<p><strong>wider - winstea.d</strong>: is in an interview cell.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: How are you doing, Billie?</p>
<p>****: If you come here to ask me more damned questions. “Where’s this
one or that one? Did I know Vern Miller? Who did what…?” Winstead shakes
his head no.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: I didn’t come here for you to tell me
something. I came here to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>closer: billie</strong>: She sees in Winstead’s face, the
look of people she grew up with. Billie senses none of the cunning of
the lawyer/special agents she’s been dealing with. She leans forward,
indicates a cigarette out of Winstead’s pocket. He hands her one and
lights it.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: Okay, Mr. Winstead. What do you got to tell
me? Winstead leans forward.</p>
<p>****: They say you’re the man who shot him?</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: ’M’at’s right. One of them.</p>
<p><strong>billie</strong>: 6 why are you coming here to see me? To see
the damage you done?</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: Because he asked me to. This gets Billie’s
attention and she looks more closely at Winstead.</p>
<p><strong>winstead</strong>: When he went down, he said something. And
I put my ear next to his mouth and what I think he said was this. He
said…</p>
<p>****: ” .tell Billie for me…Bye Bye Blackbird…” Billie has to rise
and turn away from Winstead so that he doesn’t see her overcome with
emotion. Winstead knows this. It is the measure of this man that he
respected the privacy of John Dillinger’s message and only told her.</p>
