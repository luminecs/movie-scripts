<p><strong>vada</strong>: I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet
seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i’ve learned to live
with this chicken Bone that’s been lodged in my throat for the past
three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my
latest affliction. Dad, I don’t wanna upset you, but my left breast is
developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only
mean one thing. Cancer. I’m dying.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of
the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: All right, who’s in raise your hand.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Are you coming or not Thomas J?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I knew he wouldn’t come.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I can’t, I have to go home.</p>
<p><strong>boy#2</strong>: Yeah, to play with his DOLLS.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Leave him alone! Come on, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hey, you didn’t pay me!</p>
<p><strong>boy#2</strong>: How do I know you were gonna show us one?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You’re such a baby.</p>
<p><strong>boy#2</strong>: All right, here.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: All right, follow me and don’t say a word.</p>
<p><strong>boy#3</strong>: I’m not chicken!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Okay. Lean forward.</p>
<p><strong>girl#1</strong>: It’s empty!</p>
<p><strong>boy#2</strong>: You’re so weird!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I want my money back!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I was afraid of this.</p>
<p><strong>boy#2</strong>: Of what??</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Well, sometimes when we get ’em, they’re not
completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it
still runs around crazy.</p>
<p><strong>boy#3</strong>: You’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I bet she’s roaming around this house
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hi Grammoo.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Vada would you bring down my cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Seeya later.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Did I tell you, he was my woodshop
teacher.</p>

yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ya, that rack holds six ties.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I still have mine.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Arthur!!</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Vada!!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Good for you baby.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park
Place he puts a shoe in your way.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: I like to buy off all the railroads.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Vada, we’re trying to work here.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was
gonna make a fur out of ’em!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hand me the canula.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m embalming my high school teacher, don’t
sing. All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle…..</p>

second?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Oh.</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong>: I think it’s still available.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I’m a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for
two years, at the “Dino Raphael” Salon, all my customers cried when I
told them I was leaving.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uhh, Miss devoto…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I have a wonderful disposition, I put people
right at ease.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at
ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it’s a Funeral Parlor.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: They’re dead?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes they are.</p>

<p><strong>vada</strong>: Is that your camper?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: That’s really cool.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: She’s shy.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just put it back in the display room
fellers.</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Okay Harry.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Daddy, how come that coffin’s so small?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They come in all sizes honey, just like
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Is it for a child?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Then who’s it for?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Short people, very short people.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Excuse me, what about the job?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I need the job.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Ohh, oh sure it’s no big deal, you see all
my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be
alive, so they have something in common.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’d be doing hair and makeup and answering
the phone.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Great, you can start right away. Call me
Harry. Now, umm, is this what you’d normally wear for work? Don’t get me
wrong, I like it, very much, but the….</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I promise i’ll take good care of these
people, they deserve it, they’re dead, all they’ve got left is their
looks.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Hey look at this, no feet!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Oh wow, a real evil canieval.</p>
<p><strong>nurse randall</strong>: Hi Vada, what’s wrong today?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’m very sick.</p>
<p><strong>nurse randall</strong>: Okay, take a seat, i’ll check if the
doctor can see you.</p>
<p><strong>nurse randall</strong>: Okay, he’ll see you, why don’t you go
in?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Well, what is it? I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>dr welty</strong>: You are perfectly healthy.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: That can’t be, I have all the classic
symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>dr welty</strong>: Sweetheart, did they bring Mr. Layton to
your house today?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dr welty</strong>: Vada you’ve gotta stop this, there’s
absolutely nothing wrong with you!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’ll just have to get a second opinion.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: So, what’d he say was wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: The whole medical profession is a crack.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Hey wait up for me!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hey look!</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: At what?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: That’s Mr. Bixler, let’s go talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I don’t wanna talk to a teacher, it’s
summer!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hi Mr. Bixler!</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing
Dr. J! How’s the summer treating you?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the
books for summer reading.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Really? Already? The summer’s just
begun.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Yes, and now I’m reading War &amp; Peace for
fun.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: No wonder you’re my prize pupil. What
about you Thomas J?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I haven’t started yet.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Better get on his case Vada.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Mr. Bixler, how come you’re painting this old
house?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Well I just bought it, now I’m fixing it
up.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: This is one big house for one single
person.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Well, you never can tell… I might get a
pet.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: How are you gonna get the money for this old
house if you’re not working?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Well I’m gonna teach creative writing
this summer, so, I’m doing some work.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: How much does it cost?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Thirty five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What do you get for that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Me, two hours a week, talking about
poetry. This an interrogation Vada?</p>

<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Wanna go to Gray’s orchard and pick some
peaches?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No, I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Why? It’s not dinner time yet.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dinner time?? You’re like a dog! You just go
home to eat.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Excuse me Harry, I finished Mr. Layton’s
hair. He kinda looked…… Harry, what’s wrong with her??</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, she’s just pretending. Vada, get up here
and eat your broccoli!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I think it’s my prostate.</p>
<p><strong>grammoo</strong>: I got rhythm, I got music, I got my man who
could ask for anything more? I got daisies, in green pastures, I got my
man, who could ask for anything more?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Who’s winning?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>girl#1</strong>: Look, there’s Vada and her little
BOYFRIEND</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: He is not my boyfriend!</p>
<p><strong>girl#2</strong>: I bet she kissed him on the lips!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Do you think I kissed that ugly old thing?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Yeah anyway.</p>
<p><strong>girl#2</strong>: Come on let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>girl#1 &amp; girl#2</strong>: Judy’s father owns the movie
theater and we get to see all the movies WE want for free.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Maybe you can come some time.</p>
<p><strong>guy#2</strong>: Eeeuww, don’t invite HER, she’ll have to
bring her boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>girl#2</strong>: Vada and Thomas, sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-
I-N-G, first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes Thomas J in a
baby carriage.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You know Vada, you shouldn’t let those girls
upset you.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’m not upset. I will never play with those
girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually
stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Want a piece of chocolate?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Thomas J?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I’m allergic to it.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: To chocolate?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: He’s allergic to everything.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Chocolate?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Ooh, that’s a pretty ring you’re
wearing.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s a mood ring, it tells what mood I’m
in.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: It doesn’t work, it always stays
black.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s only black when you’re around ’cause you
put me in a bad mood.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Maybe black means you’re happy?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I don’t think so. Shelly, how can I get thirty
five dollars?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: She’s crazy, she wants to go to school
over the summer.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s not a real school, it’s a writing class,
I wanna be a writer.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: She only wants to do it because her
sweetie pie’s the teacher.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Shut your big fat mouth!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I think you’d make a fine writer, did you
ask your Dad?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: He won’t give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well you don’t know that. Ask him.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s a lot of money for a little girl.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s for school, for summer writing class.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Any more soda left?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Shelly thinks I’d be a good writer.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Last month you wanted to play the violin.
Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I love this guy!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dad??</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: The money?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ahh, maybe next summer.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: He forgot about the time I wanted
to be a magician, I was really great at making myself disappear.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Wanna play?</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: No, I gotta go to the cemetery, keep your
head up. Don’t look at the ball, look at me.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Vada? VADA?? What happened??</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: My ball, I lost my ball.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Come on sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Excuse me Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh huh?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yeah,</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You don’t like it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This was the Reverend Porter’s wife, you have
her looking like a two dollar hooker.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I think she looks nice! Her lips are very
thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her
eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I’m sorry, nobody
wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She did. This photo was taken a month ago at
the church food drive.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I just wanted to get past this “old school
Marm” image.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That wasn’t an image. She WAS an old school
Marm. Fix it.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Harry? I was just wondering, if there is
anything wrong with Vada.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What do you mean??</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well the other night at dinner…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh that, she just likes to play.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I don’t think so, I think she’s confused
about death.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a
thing or two about it.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Harry, I really think she…..</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She’s a perfectly happy eleven year old girl,
look, don’t give me any advice about my daughter, okay?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: There’s Shelly!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Can we look around in your camper?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Sure. I’ll give you the royal tour.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you
really eat and sleep here?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I’m gonna drive us to Liverpool.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Liverpool?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Big Ringo fan.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I would.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Thomas?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Yes please.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: What are you reading?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh! You shouldn’t be looking at that, it’s a
little too old for you.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Did you read ALL these books?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What are they about?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Mostly love, and romance.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Eeeeuuuww, gross.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: They’re just fun to read.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: No, I’m divorced.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Daddy said it’s bad when people get
divorced.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well, sometimes married people just find out
they can’t live with each other.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Mine aren’t divorced.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: With bottle of soda in mouth</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Hey, where are all the cookies??</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well, I guess you found my secret hiding
place.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: What are you saving for?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Nothing in particular, just putting it away
for a rainy day.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I’m supposed to be home at noon for lunch,
thanks Shelly.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d’you say we head
back?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Can I use your bathroom first?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You don’t have to wait, daddy’ll be mad if
you’re late.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: The great way, is not difficult for
those with no preferences, with the absence of both love and hate,
everything becomes clear and undisguised. That was written by a Chinese
Philosopher in the year 600. Now why would I choose to bring that up in
a creative writing class? Because, the absence of judgment helps us to
appreciate reality. In other words, I want you to listen to your
classmates writing, with a clear and open heart, okay? So who’s gonna go
first?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I got one.</p>
<p><strong>guy#2</strong>: That’s not funny, his poem is about futility,
we toil in unrewarded obscurity.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Now, I hear judgment, let’s not forget
the part about the open heart…</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I paid the money.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: For this class?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Vada, this is an adult writing
class.</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: Hey, I think it’s real beautiful. She want’s
to be a writer.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Vada, you sure you wanna do this?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Welcome to the class, go find a
seat.</p>
<p><strong>ronda</strong>: I experienced something with my boyfriend the
other day, and I wrote a few words down.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: The floor’s yours Ronda.</p>
<p><strong>ronda</strong>: He covers me like a blanket, from the cold,
dark night, As I look into his eyes, I know it’s right, To touch, To
feel, I know he’s real, Flesh all a mush, Flesh ALL a mush, I can’t
fight it, There’s no point, I wake up in Lighter joint.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I wrote a poem too.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like
ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in
a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road,
Even with pie a la mode.</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: I hear that Vada, Flesh all a Mush or Rocky
Road, it’s about desire.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Vada that’s… It’s very sweet, and it
rhymes and that’s also good but, you’re not expressing to me what’s in
your soul. I want you to show me how you see the world, your fears, your
desires, your innermost secrets.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: My fears and secrets. I’m afraid I
killed my mother.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Can not do without, Harry’s wild about
me.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Excuse me Harry, I’m sorry, I just wanna let
you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room’s all set up.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the
other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I shouldn’t stick my nose in other people’s
business. It’s just that I like Vada, very much.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to
help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind’s
been wandering more and more, Vada’s been acting kinda crazy. I’m sure
she’ll snap out of it though.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I’m sure she will.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Nothing’s biting today.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Maybe they had a big breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I’m gonna be an acrobat when I grow
up.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Big deal, I can do that too. Thomas J, you got
something!</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Reel it in. He’s only tiny, throw him
back.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I don’t like touching fish, how do you
pull the hook out without touching it?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You’re hurting him, don’t kill him!!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Ouch! Darn hook!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’m bleeding, did he get away? Go look.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Yeah he got away. Come on let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hey, we can become blood brothers.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Naah, I don’t wanna.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You could pick that scab on your arm.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: It’s a mosquito bite.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’ll bleed.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: If I do it, can we go?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Okay, OW!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Okay, rub them together.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Now we’re blood brothers for life.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh Hi, what can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Nothing, I was just wondering what you were
doing.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, I’m just typing up a funeral notice, you
know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it’s a
service we provide for the family.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh right, right, Bader Lorenzo Died June 22
1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and
Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names
society.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I wrote that.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh it’s good, “In lieu of” I love that word
lieu.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I prefer it to “instead”, it has more
dignity.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: In lieu… “instead”…. No contest.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You have to learn how to take a complement.
Movies, movies, ahhhh, “Love Story” at the drive in, I cried my eyes
out, did you see it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I haven’t been to the movies in AGES.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I love going to movies, especially at the
drive in. I don’t think there’s anything more romantic than going to the
drive in. I’ll let you get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I do enjoy playing bingo, if you’d like to
join me for a game tomorrow night at church you’re welcome to.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hi Vada.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Are you going out somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: So how come you’re putting lipstick on?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: A girl’s always gotta look her best.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are
that color.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Have you ever tried any?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Come here, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Now, first we blot.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Take a look. I think it looks real nice on
you.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Shelly, do you think I’m pretty?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yes, Vada I think you’re very pretty. You’ve
got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: The boys at school don’t think I am.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: They’ll come around. Close your eyes, I
wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying
eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Do you like putting makeup on people?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Uh huh, i’ve been trying to get out to
Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven’t gotten
there yet. All right, open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Shelly, I would definitely hold off on that
Hollywood thing.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Your lip bleeding?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: What’s wrong with your eyes?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Where’s your bike?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s only a garage, come on.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hey, one of my streamers is gone! It probably
fell off in here.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Hey look at this!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: That was Grammoo’s. It’s a phrenology chart,
they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good
personality or not. Come here, i’ll diagnose your head.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: No, I don’t wanna.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Come on, it’s fun.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hmmmm, interesting.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You have no personality.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Hey, where does it say that?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Is that your Dad?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Who’s that with your Dad?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s my mother.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Do you remember her?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No. Grammoo said she’s in heaven.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: What do you think it’s like?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I think, everybody gets their own white horse,
and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody’s
best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there’s no
teams, so nobody gets picked last.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: But, what if you’re afraid to ride
horses?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It doesn’t matter, ’cause they’re not regular
horses, they got wings, and it’s no big deal if you fall, you just land
in cloud.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: That doesn’t sound so bad, come on, we’ll
never find that streamer.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well well well, what’s going on in here?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Nothing, I’m dressing.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh, you’re dressing, uh huh, Harry Harry Harry
Harry, don’t you know it’s not nice to lie to your big brother?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh yes, oh that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m very nervous.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The last date I had was twenty years ago.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: That’s true. Harry Harry sit down, let me fill
you in on today’s women, since the last time you dated, something
happened, “The Sexual Revolution”, now before that, you used to have to
hold a door open for a woman, pull her chair out, pick up the check, no
more no more, you wanna know what else is missing?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh come on.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Harry, I’m serious, trust me Harry this
woman’s lifting us in, you gotta treat her like every Tom Dick and
Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Are you sure about all this?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Did you not tell Vada I’m a womanizer huh?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, I’m running late. Shelly’ll be here any
minute.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Oh she’s picking you up, good you’re on the
right track.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, she’s just driving over here, then we’re
taking my car. How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Like a Sultenfuss. Go get ’em.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Goodnight Vada.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dad, why are you dressed up to go to
bingo?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ahh, I just wanna look nice.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You never cared before.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well Shelly’s coming over, we’re gonna go
together.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She likes to play bingo.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Can I go too?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Naah, I think you’d better stay here and keep
Grammoo company.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Vada? Vada?? Where are you??</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Don’t DO that!!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: What do you want? My mom will skin me
alive if she finds I’m out here.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Let’s go to the church, they’re playing bingo
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I told you i’ll get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Pacifist!</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I am not.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Bed wetter!</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I stopped that!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t worry, there’s a strategy to bingo. For
instance, on a given night anybody can win, but I play the odds, when
choosing bingo cards, I use a range of theories from the laws of
probability to avoiding duplicate number systems. This way you get much
more activity.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Does it make it easier to win?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. Just, more activity.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hi Carl.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: They’re not gonna let us in Vada, we’re
kids.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: We’re not gonna bet, we’re just gonna
watch.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Watch bingo? I don’t even like to play
bingo.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Duck!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh great!</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Hey there’s your Dad and Shelly.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Ssshhhhh, I don’t want them to see me.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Aarrggh.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I just had a terrible thought Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I’m gonna be putting makeup on some of these
people very soon.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why d’you think these seats were empty.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Can we go yet?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Go???</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: You know I’m not allowed outside my myself
after dark.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh, I’m just not lucky Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, it’s not always luck, I mean, depending
upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as
easily as a guy with 100.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Kinda like men.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, how do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You can be in a room with 100 men, and not
like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he’s
exactly the one you want.</p>
<p><strong>bingo announcer</strong>: We have a winner. Will the winner
please raise their hand?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: There was no bingo, it came from outside.</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: How could someone outside get a bingo?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Someone outside didn’t get a bingo, someone
outside yelled bingo you moron!</p>
<p><strong>vernon</strong>: Who are you calling a mowon?</p>
<p><strong>vernon’s wife</strong>: Put a lid on it Vernon!</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Put a lid on it?? If you weren’t 200 years
old, I’d kick your wrinkled ARSE!!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey fellers fellers, it’s just a bingo
game.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: We can go now.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I had a good time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I haven’t had a bingo partner in ages.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Would you like to come in and see my house?
Just for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, sure.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Home sweet home.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I did it myself. I read a magazine article
about how to maximize small spaces.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well it certainly looks bigger that it
seems.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You can look in the bathroom if you want.
People are always curious about that, like what happens when you
flush.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Are you mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, why?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I don’t know, tonight you just seemed a
little cool, not opening car doors and…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice
on dating 70’s women. Look I’m so out of touch, I haven’t dated women in
ages, not since my wife died.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What happened to her?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ahh, complications during child birth, she
died two days after Vada was born.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Did she ever see Vada?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I brought the baby into the room a couple of
times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It
was…..</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Dance with me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: This is where we are.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is there enough room?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I haven’t danced in…..</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: In ages, I know, me neither.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Rock?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: See, you’re not that out of touch. You’re
good.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot
date, I did a killer frugue.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What are you wearing?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Old Spice, Phil says it’s a timeless
classic.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Do you want to?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Want to what?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Kiss me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Good at kissing, and dancing, I’m very
optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I ahh, better go.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It’s only eight o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Goodnight Shelly.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well, I guess it’s official we had a date,
maybe we can play bingo again sometime.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m tired of bingo, maybe we should try that
drive in of yours.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Before the class started, Ronda and
Justin wanted to lead the class in a group meditation.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Ooooh that’s really cool.</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: Okay what we’re gonna do is, send our vibes
out into the group.</p>
<p><strong>ronda</strong>: Everybody hold hands, and close your eyes.
Relax your muscles and take deep breaths.</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: Now, try to feel what the other person is
feeling, without speaking any words, send out your vibe, and receive the
vibes around you at the same time. Can you feel it?</p>
<p><strong>ronda</strong>: Okay, open your eyes. What did everybody
feel?</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: I felt Mrs. Hunsaker’s strength.</p>
<p><strong>other guy</strong>: I can feel that Ronda is one with the
Earth, she’s so cosmically in tune.</p>
<p><strong>ronda</strong>: So right on, that’s exactly what I sent out,
and I felt like, you were full of inner peace and harmony.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Vada, what did you feel.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I felt Justin’s hangnail.</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: No Vada, that’s not what we’re looking for,
a hangnail is insignificant. What’s in my soul, feel my aura.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I don’t think I’m allowed to.</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: I tell you what, let’s try it again, hold
hands.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: Grammoo once had a hangnail on her
big toe. It got infected and traveled to her vocal chords, it ruined her
singing voice, I don’t think Grammoo thought it was insignificant.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Lettuce, watch out for the rust when you get
lettuce.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi
Vada.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m just picking some things up for the
barbecue.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not at all. Lot of potatoes!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It’s for Shelly’s famous potato salad.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m looking forward to that.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you’re
doing.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You know this is gonna be my first 4th of
July picnic in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dad, didn’t you say you needed prunes REAL
bad?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the
cart, anything at all. I don’t know what’s gotten into her today.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: I used to like to play with my Ken
and Barbie dolls, Ken was my favorite. Then one Christmas I got them a
camper, and all they wanted to do was hang out in it by themselves. So I
wasn’t too upset when they took that wrong turn and went over a
cliff.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Harry Harry Harry Harry Harry, I told you to
use fewer briquettes and now look what you’ve done. You’ve cremated
them.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s what I do. Do you wanna do it??</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: No, no no….</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look if you think you know how, why don’t you
pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product,
support me for a while!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: How’s it going chef?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Are they ready yet?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, sweetie, not yet.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Soon honey, soon.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: When??</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: In a minute, look it’s hot, sweetie you’ll
burn your nose, look out.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay
God.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll second that.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hey Shelly, like seafood?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Uh huh, why?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: See food!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: That’s attractive.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh shit! Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hey Shelly, who lives here? The Addams
Family?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Danny, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What am I doing here????? What am I doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how’d you find me
here?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You told everybody where you were going, I’m
here for the motor home.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: These two people do not have a good
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: No! <em>I</em> bought it, <em>I</em> paid
for it…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I’ve been living in it for over a year, the
camper is mine.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Excuse me, MUTUAL ASSET, that’s what the
lawyer said, it’s supposed to be “OUR MUTUAL ASSET”, not “Shelly’s
recreational vehicle”. Gimme the keys.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Keep your voice down!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: The boss is watching us…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m impressed.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: God I guess i’ll have to introduce you
now.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Yeah, all right…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada
Sultenfuss…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Vada Sultenfuss?? Tough break.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I like my name.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino
Raphael salon in Detroit. We used to be married.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Are you here to take Shelly back?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uhh, it’s nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got
burgers and hot dogs here if you’d care to join us?</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Can’t stay, I’m just here because my
wife…..</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Ex…ex, ex…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: My <strong>EX</strong> wife seems to have
ripped off my camper.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shelly?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I
promise…..</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I don’t think so, I got a copy of the
property settlement right here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Danny?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Okay, I know you’ve suffered a terrible loss,
and there’s really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you
to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the
sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they’ll live on in your
heart forever.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: This guy bonking you?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Danny that’s a real <em>bonehead</em> thing
to say!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, you’re not gonna take Shelly’s
camper.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh.. Oh.. Oh no?? Oh?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s her home! It’s where she lives!!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Oh really, okay fine look, go cook, Gimme the
goddam keys.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Stop it! That hurts!!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Danny…..</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: What’d you do that for??</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>ralph</strong>: I’m his brother.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh then you’ll probably be visiting us here
quite often.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Because if he ever tries to take Shelly’s
camper again, I’m gonna bury him in my front yard.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Your father is a savage.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Bye Ralph.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well, you were pretty great!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is it really your camper?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Can we see it from the back yard?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You can get the general idea…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yep, there they are… They always look the
same every year…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Pointing upwards Look…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Did you ahh, love him?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I would never marry anybody I didn’t
love.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit
anyone in his life.</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: He likes her.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Does he love her?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Do you like her?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Yes I do, and I think she’s very good for your
father.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: After your mother died, he was sad all the
time, but before that, he was pretty funny.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Now when I see him with Shelly, sometimes he
seems like the old Harry.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: My Dad was funny?</p>
<p><strong>phil</strong>: Well he wasn’t one of the Marx brothers, but
he made me laugh.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: My Uncle fought in the Korean war,
he had a steel plate put in his head, Daddy said he didn’t come back the
same, one night, he picked up a radio station from Oklahoma in his
teeth, it was really neat.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Aaaaaaaaaahhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Carnnk yu sheeee ik??</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Can’t you see it?</p>
<p><strong>dr welty</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It’s there.</p>
<p><strong>dr welty</strong>: Vada there is no chicken bone stuck in
your throat.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dr. Welty, are you sure those are yours?</p>
<p><strong>nurse randall</strong>: So you fill it with water like this,
and what have you got? A water gun.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Cool, can I get one for Vada?</p>
<p><strong>nurse randall</strong>: Oh yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Cause she’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>nurse randall</strong>: Do you think she is?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nurse randall</strong>: Why do you think she says that?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Cause she gets scared of all those dead
people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can’t beat ’em,
join ’em, well if she’s one of them, she won’t be as scared.</p>
<p><strong>nurse randall</strong>: You know what I think? I think Vada’s
very lucky to have a friend like you.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: She’s my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>nurse randall</strong>: Miss Vada, how are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: As good as can be expected.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Hey Vada, guess what we got?</p>

<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: You’re right, let’s knock it down.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What do you want it for anyway?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: For their meat.</p>

<p><strong>harry</strong>: Vada is that you?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Yes..</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey guess what? We’re going to the carnival
tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shelly’s coming with us.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: So Vada, what’s your favorite ride?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I like the freak show.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know, I know, let’s go on the “sit on the
bench and rest” ride.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I don’t think that that roller coaster
agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you
eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David
and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down
with nephritis.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Nephritis? It’s a kidney disease, you don’t
get it from hot dogs.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well, I’m no doctor. All I know is, the next
day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They
baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: They were!! “Popular Mechanics”, no “Popular
Science”. I don’t know, popular.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh look they’re trying to hit that poor
thing.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Watch you don’t knock out a fish.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know which ball’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I won, I won!!!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh great!!</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Hooray, we have a winner, There you go
little girl. See how easy it is folks!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh Vada, that’s a gorgeous goldfish.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Where’d you get that ring?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Did you win it?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Vada we have something to tell you.
Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Vada we have some good news, Shelly and I are
getting married.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Oh my fish!!!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We’re having the wedding sometime near the
end of the summer.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Not acknowledging Harry’s comment You’ll be
okay little fish.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Vada? Would you like us to get you another
goldfish?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: NO!, He’s fine. Fish are very resilient
animals you know. Don’t worry, I won’t get another fish.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh bumper cars, oh you can’t go to a
carnival and not ride the bumper cars.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I fall asleep at the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’ll ride on the bumper cars with you!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Oh great Vada, come on…</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Uhh, two. I got the blue one!!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yes!!</p>

<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I wanna live with them too.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No, you can’t, they have enough kids, you’ll

<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Get up!?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I’m tired of running away. Besides, we

<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Why are you running away?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: My Dad gave Shelly a ring.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Wow, was it a decoder ring?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You’re such a retard, it was an engagement
ring.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: They’re getting married?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: So now you’ll have a mother.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I don’t like her.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I do, she’s real funny.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: He likes her better than me.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I’m hungry, I can’t last any longer.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Then go home, baby.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: I have to anyway, my mom will be
worried.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Leave then, some friend you are.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: You can come to my house for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No, I’m hiding out.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Okay, seeya.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: In social studies we learned some
people stole the Limburg baby right out of his house, I think i’ll sleep
with my window OPEN tonight.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: DADDY!! Daddy daddy!!!! Daddy!!??!?!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Daddy??!?!?!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Vada, Vada, what’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Where’s Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well he just left, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’m hemorrhaging.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What do you mean you’re hemorrhaging?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I don’t want, I don’t need your help….</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Vada, did this happen in the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’m eleven and a half.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It’s okay, come on upstairs, we have to have
a little talk.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It’s actually a very beautiful thing, and
look there wouldn’t have been a Vada.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I think it should be outlawed.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Believe me, some day, you’ll feel
differently.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Oh, that’s probably Thomas J, I don’t wanna
see him. It’s not fair. Nothing happens to boys.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Hi Vada, can you come out?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I dunno..</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Please, it’s real hot, maybe we can go
swimming?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Grammoo, I’m going to the bathroom, i’ll be
right back.</p>
<p><strong>grammoo</strong>: It’s quarter to three, there’s no-one in
the place, just you and me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m so sorry, it’s all right ma, I’m very
very sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Grabs Vada by the shoulders</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Why do you think people want to get
married?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Well when you get older, you just have
to.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’m gonna marry Mr. Bixler.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: You can’t marry a teacher, it’s against
the law.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It is not.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Yes it is, cause then he’ll give you all
A’s and it won’t be fair.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Not true.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Have you ever kissed anyone?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Like they do on TV?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Maybe we should, just to see what’s the big
deal.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: But, I don’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Here, practice on your arm like this.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Like this?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Uh huh. Okay, enough practice.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: But then I won’t be able to see
anything.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Just do it.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Okay, okay.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Okay on the count of three.</p>

<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: On political agents to the flag of the
United States of America,</p>
<p><strong>thomas j &amp; vada</strong>: And to the republic for which
it stands, one nation, under God, individual, with liberty and justice
for all.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: You better not tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: You better not either.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Well, let’s spit on it.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Seeya tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Okay, seeya. Vada?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Would you think of me?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Well if you don’t get to marry
Mr. Bixler.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>thomas j</strong>: Ow, ahh, NO!, Get away!!!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hi Vada.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What are you doing.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Feeding my fish.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is that the fish you won at the carnival?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He’s getting big. Vada, come here and sit
down for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Vada, something happened to Thomas J last
night, he stepped on a beehive.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get
stung?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Maybe I should go over and yell at him.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No sweetheart, you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He was allergic to bees.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: He’s okay isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There were just too many of ’em.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??</p>
<p><strong>dr welty</strong>: Vada, what’s wrong sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I can’t breathe, I’m suffocating.</p>
<p><strong>dr welty</strong>: Oh, wait relax now, let me look, let me
look, come up here and we’ll have a look.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.</p>
<p><strong>dr welty</strong>: What Hurts Vada?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: The bee stings! I can’t breathe!</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Knocks Vada?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi, is Vada home?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Yes she is, but she’s very upset, so she’s
not seeing anyone.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, I’m Judy, I go to school with her, I
wanted to tell her I’m sorry about Thomas J.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Well maybe she’ll feel better in a couple of
days.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Will you tell her I came by?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Thank you. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>rev</strong>: Hi Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ahh, Reverand Miles.</p>
<p><strong>rev</strong>: The Sennetts want to thank you for taking care
of things so quickly.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Vada? I see you took your tray in,</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: She won’t come out. It’s been a whole day.
You have to do something Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The funeral’s starting.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Open your eyes, she’s eleven years old! Her
only friend in the world is dead.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know that, but what do you want from
me?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I
first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn’t exactly
thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, “if I’m living
without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a
while i’ll be invited in for supper.”</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted
because there’s a car crash, or there’s a fire, or a little boy steps on
a beehive.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I’m not asking you to stop feeling for those
people. But life isn’t just death Harry, don’t ignore the living,
especially your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>arthur</strong>: Excuse me Harry, Shelly, the minister’s
about to begin.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thank you Arthur.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: We are here to honor Thomas James Sennett.
He was born, May 7 1961, in Madison, Pennsylvania, and he was survived
by his loving parents, Charles and Susan Sennett……</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: The family has asked me to say a few words
before we proceed. No words that I could say, would begin to describe
the loss and grieving, one word that keeps ringing in my ear is Why?.
Why would God choose to take this little boy from us? I can’t give you
an answer to that question, but I can tell you that God has chosen
Thomas J for some very special reason, we must find solace in knowing
that Thomas J is now in Gods care. In that face, there is no sorrow such
as….</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: ….disciples began to chastise them, and
Jesus said “Let the children come to me, do not hinder them, for the
Kingdom of God belongs to such as these. He laid his hands on their
heads before he left that place, let us pray in silence.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Wanna go tree climbing Thomas J?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: His face hurts, and where is his glasses? He
can’t see without his glasses! Put his glasses on! Put on his glasses!
He was gonna be an acrobat.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He’s gone sweetheart. He’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Get away, get away!!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Vada wait! Vada! Vada!!</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Vada! I was just on my way to your
house. Are you all right? I’m so sorry about Thomas J.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Okay, okay we don’t have to talk about
him, Vada, Vada we don’t have to talk about him, it’s okay. We won’t
talk about him all right?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people
what I feel.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Come here, sit down over here.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Mr. Bixler, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Oh, Vada…</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna
live here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Pause as he takes all this in I think
your Dad would miss you.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No he wouldn’t, I can’t go home.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: I’ll be ready in a second, I just can’t
seem to find my other earring….</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Suzanne, this is Vada.</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Vada, hi, I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Could you just give us a minute?</p>
<p><strong>suzanne</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: That’s Suzanne. She and I are gonna be
married this Fall.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: No….</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: I…I was gonna bring her to class next
week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him
too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don’t…..</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: Why do you think people wanna get
married?</p>
<p><strong>thomas j’s voice</strong>: When you get old, you just have
to.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j’s voice</strong>: Who’s that with your Dad?</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: It’s my mother.</p>
<p><strong>thomas j’s voice</strong>: I’m gonna be an acrobat when I
grow up. Vada, would you think of me? Well if you don’t get to marry
Mr. Bixler.</p>
<p><strong>vada’s thoughts</strong>: Now we’re blood brothers for
life.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Shelly I’m sorry but we haven’t found her
yet.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It’s dark, she can’t be alone in the
dark.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: We’ll keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: We, no, we’ve been looking since this
morning, her teacher called, and he said that she went there
first…..</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: I know, I know you told us.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: But I….</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Vada. Are you okay? Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I should have told Thomas J that he was my
best friend.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I’m sure he knew.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Shelly, I stole some money from your cookie
jar, to pay for the writing class.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: It’s okay sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I’ll pay it back, besides, I don’t think i’ll
ever go to class again.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: I’ll tell you what, you dedicate your first
book to me, and we’ll forget about the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I will I promise.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Okay, get in to bed.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: She’s in.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Did I kill my mother?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my
mother.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No sweetie that wasn’t your fault, things
like that aren’t anybody’s fault, it just happened.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I found this.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I forgot about that picture, where did you
find it?</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: In the garage.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers
favorite car.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: What was my mama like?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes.
Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just
like her.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Uh huh. You know what your mother did when
she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this
whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Do you miss her?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and
even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset
that your mother would have liked.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I think every time I see a climbing tree i’ll
think of Thomas J.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s good, memories are good sweetheart.
Vada, I’m sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn’t.
You’re a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don’t be an old grump
like me. Seeya in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Daddy, it’s not so bad to be like you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Mrs. Sennett, how are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sennett</strong>: Some days I think i’ll be okay,
others, well I have to force myself even to get out of bed, I know it’s
crazy, but sometimes I think he’s just away at summer camp. How’s
Vada?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh she’s doing much better. Ahh she’s just
inside.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Mrs. Sennett.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sennett</strong>: Vada. I’ve been wanting to come over
to see you, Thomas J had this on him, I thought you might like to have
it.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I will, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Mrs. Sennett. Thomas J will be all right, my
mother will take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sennett</strong>: Thank you Vada.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Encased in talent, like a uniform, the
rank of every poet, is well known. They can amaze us like a
thunderstorm, or die so young, or live for years alone. My advice to you
on our last class, be a thunderstorm.</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: What exactly do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: I mean, be dangerous And unpredictable.
And make a lot of noise.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: Vada.</p>
<p><strong>justin</strong>: Hey, we missed you man! Gimme a hug!</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: I was hoping you’d stop by today.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: I can’t stay, I just came to read my poem.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bixler</strong>: We’d love to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>vada</strong>: Weeping willow with your tears running down,
Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is
it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you
long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your
shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop
your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if
you forever part, But I know he’ll always be in your heart.</p>
