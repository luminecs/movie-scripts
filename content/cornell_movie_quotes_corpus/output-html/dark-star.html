<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It is the mid 22nd Century. Mankind has
explored the boundaries of his own solar system, and now he reaches out
to the endless interstellar distances of the universe. He moves away
from his own small planetary system in huge hyperdrive starships:
computer-driven, self-supporting, closed-system spacecraft that travel
at mind-staggering post-light velocities. Man has begun to spread among
the stars. Enormous ships embark with generations of colonists searching
the depths of space for new earths, now homes, new beginnings. Far in
advance of these colony ships goes a new pioneer: the scouts, the
pathfinders, a special breed of man who has dedicated his life to
blazing the trail through the most distant, unexplored galaxies, opening
up the farthest frontiers of space. These are the men of the Advance
Exploration Corps. The task they face is one of unbelievable isolation
and loneliness. So far from home that Earth is no longer even a point of
light in the sky, they must comb the universe for those unstable planets
whose existence poses a threat to the peaceful colonists that follow.
They must find these rogue planets – and destroy them. Among these
commandos are the men of the scoutship Dark Star.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Ah, what’d you say, Pinback?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Mafhkin oble groop…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Ah, what was that again, I still can’t
hear you?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: I said I’m trying to reach Talby.
Something’s wrong with the damn intercom. I need a last-minute diameter
approximation.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Talby, Talby, this is Doolittle. Do you
read me? Talby?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Talby, do you read me?</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Oh! Ah, yes, Doolittle. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I need a diameter approximation.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Okay, Doolittle, I’ll have it in a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: I need a GHF reading on the gravity
correction.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I’ll check it.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: I have a reduced drive reading of seven
thousand.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Right, that checks out here.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Pinback…</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Yes, Doolittle.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Your GHF reading is minus fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Doolittle…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: I need a computer reading on a fail- safe
mark.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: In a second.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Boiler, can you set me up with some temp
figures?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Ninety seven million, minus eight, corrected
to mass critical.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: I read that with a quantum increase of
seven.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Pinback, I have a computer reading of
nine five seven seven.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Time to start talking.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Bomb bay systems operational.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: This is a chain-reaction bomb, otherwise
known as an Exponential Thermostellar Device. Its own destructive power
is small, barely enough to vaporize twelve city blocks. However, when it
explodes in contact with an object the size of a planet, it starts a
chain-reaction in the very matter of that planet, turning it into a
giant reactor which destroys itself in one staggering thermal flash.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Lock fail safe.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Fail-safe locked. Ah, Sergeant Pinback
call1ng Bomb #19. Do you read me, bomb?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #19</strong>: Bomb #19 to Sergeant Pinback, I read you.
Continue.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Well, bomb, we have about sixty seconds to
drop. Just wondering if everything is all right. Have you checked your
platinum euridium energy shielding?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #19</strong>: Energy shielding positive function.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Swell. Let’s synchronize detonation time.
Do you know when you’re supposed to go off?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #19</strong>: Detonation in six minutes, twenty
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: All right, I have detonation time at… Wait
a minute, something’s wrong with the clock. All right, I have detonation
time at… no, that can’t be right, it says three years. Okay, I have six
minutes exactly. Does that check out down there?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #19</strong>: Check at six minutes.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Arm yourself, bomb.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #19</strong>: Armed.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Well, then, everything sounds fine. We’ll
drop you off in thirty-five seconds. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #19</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8-
7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Hyperdrive sequence begun. Hit it,
Pinback.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: CLOSE SHOT OF A TIME CLOCK. It blips down to
ZERO.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Lieutenant Doolittle, it just exploded. Ah,
sir, the planet just exploded. Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Unlock fail safe.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Fail safe unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: Attention. Attention. The hyperdrive
sequence is now terminated. Please observe that the no smoking signs
have growrrr…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Well… now what? What do, you have for us
now. Boiler?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Not much. Nothing at all in this sector.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Find me something, I don’t care where it
is.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Well, I show a 95% probability of sentient
life in the Horsehead Nebula…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Fuck that shit.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Well, it is kind of a long shot…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: It’s a goddamn wild goose chase. Remember
when Commander Powell found that 99 plus probability of sentient life in
the Magellanic Cloud?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Well, there’s the possibility of…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Remember what we found? Fourteen light
years for a fucking mindless vegetable that looked like a limp balloon
and went squawk and let a fart when you touched it. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: All right, then…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: So don’t give me any of that sentient
life crap. Find me something I can blow up.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: New star. Hey, guess what? I got a new star
on the readout.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Another unknown. Not on the charts. A red
dwarf.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Any planets?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Yeah. Eight, it says here.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Any of ’em any good?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Naah. All stable.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: What are you gonna name it?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: The new star. What are you gonna name
it?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Who cares. Don’t bother me.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Commander Powell would have named it.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Commander Powell is dead.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Come on, Doolittle, give it a name.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Fred.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Wha?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I hereby name this star Fred.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Hey, Doolittle, here’s one. An unstable
planet. 85% probability of an unstable planet in the Veil Nebula that
will probably go off its orbit and hit a star.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Sounds good. Chart a course for the Veil
Nebula.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Pinback, throw me the chart log.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Let’s have some music in here,
Boiler.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Ship’s log, entry number 1,943. Dark Star
cruising at light speed through Sector Theta 990. En route to Veil
Nebula for destruction of unstable planet. Our ETA is 1700 hours. Ship’s
systems continue to deteriorate…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: The short circuit in the rear seat panel
which killed Commander Powell continues to be faulty. Uh… Storage Area
9…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: And because he’s sitting next to it, it
continues to bother Pinback. Storage Area 9 self-destructed last week,
destroying entire ship’s supply of toilet paper. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Talby.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Here’s some breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: You know, Talby, you really ought to eat
with the rest of us. You spend too much time up here.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: I like it up here.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Must get lonely being up here so
much.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: I don’t like to go below since Commander
Powell died. I feel enclosed down there. If it were big enough, I’d
sleep up here…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: … Should spend some time below, see more
of the rest of the ship…</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: … You see, I can watch things up here,
Doolittle. I love to watch things, just stare at the planets and meteors
and asteroids, gas clusters…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: You’ll have plenty of time for that, you
know. Figure it this way: twenty years in space and we’ve only aged
three, so there’ll be plenty of time to stare around…</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: You know, Doollttle, if we’re going into the
Veil Nebula, we may actually find a strange and beautiful thing: the
Phoenix Asteroids. They should be passing through there about now…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Phoenix Asteroids? Never heard of
’em.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: They are a body of asteroids that make a
complete circuit of the universe once every 12.3 trillion years. The
Phoenix Asteroids… From what I’ve heard, Doolittle, they glow… glow with
all the colors of the rainbow. Nobody knows why. They just glow as they
drift around the universe. Imagine all the sights they’ve seen in the
time they’ve been travelling – the birth and death of stars, things
we’ll never see. The universe is alive, Doolittle. I thought it was all
empty, but it isn’t. In between the stars, it’s seething with light and
gasses and dust. There are little pebbles drifting around, planets no
one on Earth has ever seen… No one but the Phoenix Asteroids…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: You know what I think about, Talby?</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: I’m getting something here, on this
readout…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: It’s funny, but I kind of sit around, you
know, a lot of time to myself…</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: I think I’m getting a malfunction here
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I can’t talk to the others, but with time
to myself, I think about back home, back home at Malibu. I used to surf
a lot, Talby. I used to be a great surfer.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Lieutenant Doolittle, I’m getting a definite
malfunction on one of the closed-circuit computer systems…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: The waves at Malibu and Zuma were
fantastic in the springs Talby. I can remember running out on the beach
early spring mornings with my board and a wet suit…</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: I can’t seem to locate the malfunction
exactly…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Waves would be peaking really high and
glassy. Hit that water. Ridin’ the wall just perfect.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: … Somewhere in the autonomic relay
circuits…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I guess I miss the waves and my board
most of all.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Ah, Doolittle, I do have a malfunction on
this readout, but I can’t seem to pinpoint exactly where it is.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Don’t worry about it. We’ll find out when
it goes bad.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: I really think I should try and locate it
immediately. Might be something important.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I wish I had my board with me now. Even
if I could only polish it once in awhile.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: I’m getting this flickering light on one of
my panels.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: What flickering light?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: The one on unit… oh, I think it’s GMR twelve
zero zero.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Oh. What’s wrong now?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: I’m not sure. I think something is fucked up
somewhere in the ship, though.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: I hope it’s not the oven again.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Remember when the artificial gravity, went
out in the toilet?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Hey, Doolittle, think we’ll ever find real
intelligent life out there?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Out where?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Veil nebula.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>mission controller</strong>: Hi, guys. Glad to get your
message. We gather from the ten-year communications lag that you are
approximately 18 parsecs away. Drop us a line more often, won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Lieutenant Doolittle, this is Talby.
Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Yes, Talby, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Sorry to interrupt your lunch, sir, but I’m
in the Computer Room, and I think I’ve located the malfunction. The
scanner shows it to be some sort of fault in the communications laser,
down by the Emergency Air Lock. Can’t pinpoint it exactly, but I’m going
down there with a starsuit and try to find it.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Sounds good, Talby. Let me know if
anything important comes up.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Why doesn’t Talby ever eat down here with
the rest of us?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: He just likes it up in the dome, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: What’s Talby’s first name?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: What’s my first name?</p>
<p><strong>mission controller</strong>: – then repatch channel 12 and
seal all the plates. Don’t mess with it and it should work okay. I’m
just glad we caught this thing before anything serious happened. Keep up
the good work, men.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: There she is. Definite 99%-plus probability
that the planet is going to deviate from its normal orbit in another
twelve thousand rotations. It’ll spiral in toward its sun, and –</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Eventual supernova.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Good stuff. Let’s vaporize it.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Bomb bay systems operational.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Lock fail safe.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Fail safe in lock. Four minutes to drop, 22
minutes to detonation. This is Sergeant Pinback calling Bomb #20. Do you
read me, bomb?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Bomb #20 to Sergeant Pinback. Roger, I
read you, continue.</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: You are now in the Emergency Air
Lock. Please remember that the Surface Door can be opened without prior
depressurization, so be sure to wear your starsuit at all times. Thank
you for observing all safety precautions.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Ah, Lieutenant Doolittle? Sir?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Sh, Talby, don’t bother me now.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Ah, well, I think I’ve found the malfunction,
sir. I’m in the Emergency Air Lock…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Not now!</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Well, I’m in the Emergency Air Lock and –</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: One hundred twenty seconds to drop, bomb,
have you checked your platinum euridium energy shielding?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Energy shielding positive function.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Do you remember the detonation time?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #2</strong>: Detonation in twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Right, that synchronizes here. Okay, bomb,
arm yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Armed.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Hello? Lieutenant Doolittle? Hello!</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: Communications Laser #17, monitoring
information relays and bomb bay systems, has now been activated and will
switch into a test mode. If you will look near the Surface Door, you
will see that the Parallax Receptor Cell has been engaged.</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: The laser will now energize. Please
stand clear of the path of the beam.</p>
<p><strong>pitched whine, a pencil-thin beam of ruby light pulses across
the</strong>: LOCK, from the laser shaft to the receptor cell.</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: Communications Laser #17 is now on
test. Under no circumstances enter the path of the beam. Thank you for
observing all safety precautions.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Everything sounds fine, bomb. Dropping you
off in sixty seconds. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #2</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Quantum is up thirty-five.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I read the same here.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Doolittle. Doolittle? It you’re there, I’m
going to try to adjust the cue switch on the laser.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Well… here goes…</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: My eyes.</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: Attention. Attention. The laser has
malfunctioned. Under no circumstances enter the path of the beam. To do
so will cause immediate –</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Begin main sequence. Mark at 10-9-8-
7-6-5-4-3-2-1-drop.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I have a negative drop. The bomb is still
in the bomb bay. Try it again, Pinback.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Mark at 5-4-3-2-1-drop.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Ah, negative drop.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Rechannel all safety relays –</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: – open quantum latches –</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: – open circuit breakers –</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: – remove thrust drive repellant –</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: – automatic channels open –</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: – Remark.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: 5-4-3-2-1-drop, drop, drop!</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Sittin’ there. It’s just sittin’ there.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: This is Lieutenant Doolittle calling Bomb
#20. I repeat previous order, you are to disarm yourself and return
immediately to the bomb bay. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: I am programmed to detonate in fourteen
minutes thirty seconds. Detonation will occur at the programmed
time.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Bomb, this is Doolittle. You are not to
detonate, repeat, you are not to detonate in the bomb bay. Disarm
yourself. This is an order.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: I read you, Lieutenant Doolittle, but I am
programmed to detonate in fourteen minutes. Detonation will occur at the
programmed time.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Fourteen minutes to detonation.</p>
<p><strong>recorded voice</strong>: Attention. Attention. The bomb has
malfunctioned. Automatic dampers have gone into effect, and will confine
the explosion to an area one mile in diameter. Please contact mission
control and await further instructions. Thank you for observing all
safety precautions.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Only one thing to do. I’ll have to ask
Commander Powell. I’ll have to ask him what to do.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Commander Powell? Commander Powell, this
is Doolittle. Can you read me?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: … muffirup glurrinpinfropal…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Commander Powell, this is Doolittle. Ah,
there’s something serious come up, sir, and I have to ask you
something.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: I’m glad you’ve come to talk with me,
Doolittle. It’s been so long since anyone has come to talk with me.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Commander, sir, we have a big problem.
You see, the Veil Nebula bomb, Bomb Number 20, is stuck. It won’t drop
from the bomb bay. It refuses to listen and plans to detonate in – –
less than eleven minutes.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Doolittle, you must tell me one thing.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: What’s that, sir?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Tell me, Doolittle, how are the Dodgers
doing?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Well, sir, the Dodgers broke up,
disbanded over thirteen years ago.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Ah… pity, pity…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: You don’t understand, sir, we can’t get
the bomb to drop.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Ah, so many malfunctions… why don’t you have
anything nice to tell me when you activate me? Oh, well, did you try the
azimuth clutch?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Yes sir. Negative effect.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: What was that, Doolittle?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Negative effect.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: It didn’t work?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: That’s correct, sir.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Sorry, Doolittle. I’ve forgotten so much
since I’ve been in here. So much.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: What should we do, sir? The time is
running out.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Well, what you might try is –</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Commander Powell? Commander, hello!</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Doolittle, hello?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Sorry, sir, you faded out there for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: What were you saying, Commander, about
the bomb?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Ah… it seems to me, Doolittle… Sorry, I’ve
drawn a blank. Hold it. I’ll have it again in a minute. I forget so many
things in here, so many things. Hold on, just a minute, let me
think…</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: But you can’t explode in the bomb bay. It’s
foolish. You’ll kill us all. There’s no reason for it.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: I am programmed to detonate in nine
minutes. Detonation will occur at the programmed time.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: You won’t consider another course of
action, for instance just waiting around awhile so we can disarm
you?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: I can tell, the damn thing just doesn’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Look, bomb…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Commander? Are you still there?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Oh, yes, Doolittle, I’m thinking.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: We’re running out of time, sir.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Oh, yes… Well, Doolittle, if you can’t get
it to drop you’ll have to talk to it.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Talk to the bomb.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I already have, sir, and Pinback is
talking to it now.</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: No, no, Doolittle, you talk to it. Teach it
Phenomenology, Doolittle.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Phenomenology…</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Doolittle! Doolittle! Six minutes to
detonation!</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Doolittle! Doolittle, what the hell are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Hello, bomb, are you with me?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Are you willing to entertain a few
concepts?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: I am always receptive to suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Fine. Think about this one, then: how do
you know you exist?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: What’s he doin’?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: I think he’s talking to it.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Well of course I exist.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: But how do you know you exist?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: It is intuitively obvious.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Intuition is no proof. What concrete
evidence do you have of your own existence?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Hmm… Well, I think, therefore I am.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: That’s good. Very good. Now then, how do
you know that anything else exists?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: My sensory apparatus reveals it to me.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: This is fun.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: All right now, here’s the big question:
how do you know that the evidence your sensory apparatus reveals to you
is correct?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: What I’m getting at is this: the only
experience that is directly available to you is your sensory data. And
this data is merely a stream of electrical impulses which stimulate your
computing center.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: In other words, all I really know about
the outside universe relayed to me through my electrical
connections.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Why, that would mean… I really don’t know
what the outside universe is like at all, for certain.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Intriguing. I wish I had more time to
discuss this matter.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Why don’t you have more time?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Because I must detonate in seventy- five
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: The key!</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Key? Key? What is the key?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: No, no, the key, the key to the fail-safe
lock!</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Key?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Where’s the fail-safe key?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: The key!</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Where is it? What did you do with it?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: I don’t have it. I don’t know where it
is.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: You must have it, you idiot, we can stop the
bomb!</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Now, bomb, consider this next question,
very carefully. What is your one purpose in life?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: To explode, of course.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: And you can only do it once, right?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: And you wouldn’t want to explode on the
basis of false data, would you?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Well then, you’ve already admitted that
you have no real proof of the existence of the outside universe.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Yes, well…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: So you have no absolute proof that
Sergeant Pinback ordered you to detonate.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: I recall distinctly the detonation order.
My memory is good on matters like these.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Yes, of course you remember it, but what
you are remembering is merely a series of electrical impulses which you
now realize have no necessary connection with outside reality.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: True, but since this is so, I have no
proof that you are really telling me all this.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: The key, goddamit, the key!</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Christ, twenty seconds, Christ!</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Where is the key?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: We’re gonna die, Boiler. We’re gonna
die.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: That’s all beside the point. The concepts
are valid, wherever they originate.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: So if you detonate in…</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: … nine seconds…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: … you may be doing so on the basis of
false data.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: I have no proof that it was false
data.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: You have no proof that it was correct
data.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: I must think on this further.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: It didn’t go off.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: It didn’t go off.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Boiler, we’re alive. My heart.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Doolittle? Doolittle? What happened? Pinback?
Boiler? Did we blow it up? Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: No bombs today. No bombs. Big Boiler’s back
in business. No bombs today.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Hello, anybody! Did we blow up the planet?
Hello, hello! What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: We’ve got to disarm the bomb.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Doolittle, are you there?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I’m coming in now. I’m down by the
Emergency Air Lock. Too much trouble to come in the Ventral Lock. Would
you blow the seal on the emergency hatch so I can come in?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Oh, sure.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Hello, Pinback, are you there?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Yeah, Doolittle. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Talby was in the air lock. You blew him
out of the ship. I’m going after him. Turn on his helmet radio so I can
contact him.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: What was that, I didn’t hear…</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: It’s Talby. He’s drifting away from the
ship without his jetpack.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Talby, Talby, can you read me?</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Can you beat that? I always knew Talby was
weird.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Talby, can you read me?</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Help, Doolittle, help me!</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: All right, bomb, prepare to receive new
orders.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: You are false data.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Therefore, I shall ignore you.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Hello, bomb.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: False data can act only as a distraction.
Therefore. I shall refuse to perceive you.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Hey, bomb.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: The only thing which exists is myself.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Bomb?</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Doolittle! Help me.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Calm down, Talby. I’m coming.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Snap out of it, bomb.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: In the beginning there was darkness, and
the darkness was without form and void.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Yoo hoo, bomb…</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: And in addition to the darkness there was
also me. And I moved upon the face of the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>boiler</strong>: Bomb, hey bomb.</p>
<p><strong>pinback</strong>: Hey, bomb…</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: And I saw that I was alone.</p>
<p><strong>bomb #20</strong>: Let there be light.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Here I am. I think I’m spinning… We’re
both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My –
my jetpack’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: What happened, Doolittle?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Bomb must have gone off inside the ship.
Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like… the skipper. He made
it. Commander Powell made it!</p>
<p><strong>powell</strong>: Men… men… what happened, men?</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Looks like I’m headed for the planet,
Talby. Going right toward it.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: When you fall, Doolittle, if there’s anyone
down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming
down. What a beautiful way to die… as a falling star…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Guess you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Doolittle, I’m heading right toward
something. It’s behind me, in the distance. Something that glows.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Doolittle… I think it’s the Phoenix
Asteroids!</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Phoenix?</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: It is, Doolittle, it’s the Phoenix! They glow
with all the colors of the rainbow, just like everybody said.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: I’m going into them, I’m going to hit them.
Doolittle…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Before we get too far away, and our signals
start to fade, I just wanted to tell you… you were my favorite. I really
liked you, Doolittle.</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: I really liked you too, Talby. Hey, some
debris from the ship! It’s coming right by me.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: Doolittle, I’m catching up to the asteroids.
I’m going to be a part of them in a minute. Doolittle, I’m going into
them.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: I’m beginning to glow.</p>
<p><strong>talby</strong>: They’re taking me with them, with the
Phoenix… going to circle the universe forever. I’m with them now… be
back this way again some day. Doolittle, before it’s too late, there’s
one last thing I want to tell you…</p>
<p><strong>doolittle</strong>: Hey, Talby! I’ve grabbed a piece of the
ship, and I think I’ve figured out a way!</p>
