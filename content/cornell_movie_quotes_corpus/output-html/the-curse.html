<h1 id="the-curse">the-curse</h1>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I have cramps. I can’t believe I let you talk
me into this.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Come on, we’ve been double dating since
the fourth grade.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yeah even then look what happened: Michael
Mortenson kissed you and Billy Sullivan threw a worm at me.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well that’s not going to happen tonight.
George said Carlton’s a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Translation: a total geek.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Anything’s better than Mark.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: My shrink says he’s not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Your shrink always gives you bad advice.
He only hears what you choose to tell him. Mark’s an asshole, he
cheated, he borrowed money and never paid it back, he’s never had a
regular job.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: He’s a very talented musician.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Every woman at some point has to date a
musician. I wish you’d get rid of Mark for good. Every time you break up
you see him more than when you were going out.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I guess I have a weakness for him. It’s those
big brown Bambi eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So don’t look in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: That’s the girl who should be havin’ my
baby.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah, that’s likely.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I wonder what it’s like being you. Being
noticed all the time.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: People notice you Frida.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh, uh, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So I asked the bartender what “coyote
ugly” meant. It’s like the “bagger” system. You know, a two- bagger –
someone so ugly that you need two bags – one bag to put on their head
and another one in case it blows off. Or a three-bagger…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Two bags for them, and one bag for your head
in case her two fall off.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: But coyote ugly… well it’s so totally
offensive… it’s when a guy wakes up with a girl sleeping on his arm. He
looks over, and she’s so ugly that he chews through his own arm to get
away from her.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Have you heard of that Frida?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Sorry? I guess I wasn’t listening. I just
have really bad PMS.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Uh, Frida… sorry about the steak house.
It’s Carlton’s favorite.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: How come you’re a vegetarian?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: When I was a kid, we couldn’t eat meat on
Fridays. I loved Fridays because of that. Now I can’t stand the thought
of eating bloody flesh.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: He hasn’t said one word to me.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Maybe he’s just shy.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: My date always pays more attention to you
than to me.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, I don’t mean this as a criticism,
but you might not want to talk about PMS around men.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Sorry. It’s just so bad lately. You’re so
lucky you never get PMS.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I get a little bloated sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’d kill for just a little bloated.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It all starts with them going to the
bathroom together.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: That many women in one place – nothing good
can come from that.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Sorry about Frida. She’s been friends with
Jen forever.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: What’s with her? If they’re not bleeding
they’re PMSing. If they’re not PMSing, they’re warning you about the
impending doom. If you’re lucky, you get a sane person one week a month.
Then you gotta date three or four women just to get some normalcy in
your life.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m lucky Jen’s not like that.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: I don’t believe in PMS. Women made it up
just so they can be bitchy.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: My brother has an answer to PMS. A-S-S:
Abundant Sperm Syndrome. A man gets sperm build-up, and if his woman
isn’t givin’ it to ’em, he’s gotta get it elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Yeah and when your woman says you’re an
ass, say yes, I have Abundant Sperm Syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I always say the wrong thing. I shouldn’t
have come.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m coyote ugly.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: How about I give you a make-over? You’ll
feel better about yourself. You’re actually pretty, you’re just not
bringing it out.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You’re just saying that.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Do you really need these?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Only to see.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Can’t you get contacts?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, it grosses me out even thinking of
putting something in my eye.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Try to get through dinner without them.
You have beautiful eyes.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: You two must be in sync.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: He was saying that when women are close
friends they get their periods at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yeah and when we’re mad at each other
we’re out of sync. It only works if you’re on good terms.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Or if there’s a full moon.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Or if your boyfriend’s an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m so sorry! I’m such a clutz.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yes, I do think it’s important to tell the
Mother Teresa story… but no way can I pitch that to my boss.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Why the hell not?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It won’t get the ratings. He only wants
“women in jeopardy” stories.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: How about if Mother Teresa’s being stalked by
the Pope?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Only if Jane Seymour plays Mother Teresa and
Richard Chamberlain plays the Pope. It’s just not for us. I’m sorry.
Good luck with it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. grant</strong>: The Nielson’s?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: On your desk.</p>
<p><strong>mr. grant</strong>: Script coverage?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: On your desk.</p>
<p><strong>mr. grant</strong>: Coffee and…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Your desk.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: There was a script I wanted to talk to you
about… I thought maybe…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: … I could produce it.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I had a dream last night, that I was a
doormat.</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: And what do you think this means?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: That I’m a doormat of course. The shrink
makes more notes.</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: Oh, I see… interesting theory.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay, just one more stop and you’ll be all
set. Victoria’s Secret.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What do I need overpriced fancy underwear
for? Shouldn’t a guy have already decided that he likes me before he
sees me in lingerie?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It’s not about him seeing you in it. It’s
how you feel. You’ll feel sexy in lingerie and it’ll show. It’s an inner
thing.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: There’s a sale. It’s such a nice place –
classical music, relaxing atmosphere. You deserve to pamper yourself.
Come on, it can’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>woman 1</strong>: Give me that. You ain’t a D cup.</p>
<p><strong>woman 2</strong>: If you’re a D cup, I’m Pamela Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>woman 3</strong>: Is that a medium?</p>
<p><strong>woman 1</strong>: Why do they have large thongs? Anyone in a
large ain’t gonna be wearin’ no thong.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Where are all the mediums?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, grab that red one.</p>
<p><strong>woman 2</strong>: Large, small. No fucking mediums.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Jennifer, I got a medium!</p>
<p><strong>olive woman</strong>: That’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No I had it first.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: OUCH!</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Can you believe she fuckin’ bit me?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: And she got the medium.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Even on sale that stuff’s a fortune. I worked
all week to pay for a bra.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I think she broke the skin.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What a bitch. You should see a doctor.
That can be dangerous. George bit me once and I had to go to the
emergency room.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: George bit you?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I kind of asked him to. We were, you know…
he got a little carried away…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: A bite… Where’d you get bitten?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: At Victoria’s Secret.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: There was a sale.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I mean where on your body?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh, on my wrist.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: A dog at Victoria’s Secret?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, it was another woman.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: This doesn’t look human. Did she wear
dentures or… damn this is the oddest bite I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: How’s the rest of your health?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Good. Except for PMS.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: PMS. What symptoms are you experiencing?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It’s hard to describe. I get really bloated
and irritable and emotional and depressed and…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: That’s just part of being a woman. Diet and
exercise should help. Avoid salt, sugar, starches, caffeine,
alcohol…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What else is there?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: And keep a journal of your symptoms to make
sure it’s related to your period and not just in your head.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It’s not just in my head.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’ll send a nurse in to clean that bite and
give you a tetanus shot. And a rabies shot… just in case.</p>
<p><strong>frida’s mom</strong>: It’s mom. I ran into Herman today. I
wish you’d move back home and marry him. He’s got a great job at
Penneys. I don’t know why you’re in New York with all those freaks.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Sammy? Seafood Feast?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Sammy?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Didn’t mean to scare ya. It’s Frida, right?
I’m Gregory. From accounting.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: So you’re Grant’s secretary?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I do development for TV movies.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Oh, a D-Girl. You know… I have a really
great idea for a screenplay.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You’re kidding, really?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: No, I’m serious. How about we have dinner
and I tell you about it?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Nah, I don’t wanna break up with Wanda, I
just wanna see Carmen too.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Man, you’re livin’ dangerously. Let me ask
you somethin’, you always have to get women drunk before they’ll sleep
with you?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You kiddin’? They try to get ME drunk.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You’re some catch Lloyd.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey, you hear about the chick that came in
today? Said some chick bit her at Victoria’s Secret. Bitches are outta
control these days.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Jennifer, you’re early…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What are you doing here Mark?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I missed you. I wanted to see you.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Hey what’s all this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Jennifer’s giving me a makeover.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: What, you got a date or somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Since when do you care?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Sorry, I know you hate the sight of meat.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You look different. I mean you look good.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You never say that.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You do though. You look really… is that a
wonderbra?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: OUCH! Shit! What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Look what you did!</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh my god, I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Shit. And you’re eating my burger? You don’t
eat meat.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I can’t help it, it smells so good.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Fuck you have sharp nails.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: OUCH that stings! Damn, what am I going to do
with my back like this?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Worried about what all your girlfriends might
think?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Frida, you know you’re it for me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yeah right… You better go.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Hey wait, I paid three bucks for that burger.
You owe me…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You haven’t even paid me back the thousand
bucks you owe me!</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’m working on it…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Why did Gregory ask me out? I mean he’s cute
– he probably just wants to pitch his screenplay idea.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Maybe he likes you, ever think of that?
It’s good for you to go out – get your mind off Mark.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You’re so lucky you have George and don’t
need to go on dates anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What I really hated about dating was the
lines guys used to get into my apartment. “Can I use your phone?” “How
about a nightcap?” “I want to meet your cat.” And my all-time favorite,
the old standby, “I have to use your bathroom.”</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Maybe they have to pee.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Are you kidding? He might as well say,
“Can I date rape you?”</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I never thought of it like that. I never know
what to do on dates. Do guys still pay?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: They better. Of course, trouble is, you
never know what they’ll expect for it. You gotta know what to order, and
what you’re willing to do. Like if a guy spends a fortune on you, he’s
gonna feel like you owe him something.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh my god, I have a mustache!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Where? Where do you think a mustache would
be. Look!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I don’t see anything. Maybe just a
little.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Holy shit, I’m a freak.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You are not Frida, we all have a little
hair there. I didn’t even notice till you showed me. We can bleach that,
it’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hey, did you get contacts?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh, my glasses! Maybe my eyes got stronger
from not wearing them.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You hungry?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Starving.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Have whatever you want. My treat.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Man I’m starving too, I think I’ll go for
the Surf and Turf.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m not really hungry after all.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You said you’re starving. Come on, I can’t
stand a woman who won’t eat.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Maybe just one little steak…</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: My senior year, I was waiting for that
letter from Harvard. I’d heard from Yale. Got in. Brown, MIT, got in.
But Harvard… here’s the suspense… a letter comes… And everyone knows if
it’s a thin envelope you don’t get in, right? So I get a thin envelope
and I wasn’t even gonna open it. I was just gonna jump off a bridge.
Cause it was Harvard or bust…</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Okay let’s face it, I got into Harvard
cause my dad donated $50,000. I barely got a thousand on my SATs and was
kicked outta prep school, but hey, that’s life. I have a really small
penis. Which is why I tell stories about how great I am. I’m also losing
my hair and I have no interest in a relationship. I just want you to
like my screenplay idea but I do expect you to fuck me later…</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: So there I was, hanging from the edge of a
bridge, when my mom said, “Son, you got into Harvard!” It took three of
them to pull me back! Frida keeps eating.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Well, whattdaya think?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: That’s great. Highly original.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Are you gonna finish that?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’d really feel more comfortable paying for
my half of the dinner.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Hey, how about a little nightcap?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m really tired.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Come on, didn’t all that steak make you
thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No. Really, I’m… I don’t feel well. I’ve got
terrible PMS.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: They say sex is great for cramps.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Well I have it worse than cramps. Goodnight
Gregory.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Can I use your bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I really gotta pee.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You should have gone at the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I didn’t have to pee then.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: My apartment’s just such a mess.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: That’s okay. I just have to use the
bathroom and then I’ll leave.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh come on. Knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Knock what off?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You don’t have to pee.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Yes I do have to pee!</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You’re just saying that to get into my
apartment and then you’re hoping that’ll turn into something else.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I wouldn’t mind doin’ something else, but I
do really have to pee.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Uh huh. So pee.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: So pee? Here?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yeah. Whip it out. You want me to see it –
that’s what this is all about, right?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Thank god.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Even you know when PMS is over.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It was like I woke up in a murder scene. It
took me a few seconds to realize it was just my period. I must have had
a bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’re looking for Frida Harris.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m Frida Harris.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’re police detectives.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: It’s about Gregory Jameson. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh my god, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He was found a few blocks away.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Torn apart. Limb from limb. A bloody gruesome
mess.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I had a little accident.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Jesus Christ she got her period. Relax
guys. It happens.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, sorry. Uh… Gregory’s roommate told us
you were out with him last night.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yes… I… we had dinner.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Did he come home with you? Did you go to his
apartment?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, it was our first date.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Looks like it was your only date. Unless you
go to his funeral.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: When’s the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: We… he walked me home and… we said goodnight.
Um, he kissed me goodnight and that was it.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: A kiss? Did you have sex with him?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, I said it was our first date.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: How the hell is that your business?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’re just trying to figure out what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I wish I could help but last I saw Gregory
was outside my front door.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay, if you think of anything else, please
give us a call.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Uh… mind if we take those sheets in for
testing? You know, to rule everything out.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You want her sheets?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We can just take this pillowcase.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: We can get a warrant if you like.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, take it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: He’s dead? Am I bad luck or what?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: There you go, blaming yourself for
everything again.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: And he was ripped limb from limb?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m sure they were exaggerating.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Why would they exaggerate?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: To sound like big macho cops. He was
probably just found with a knife in his back.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Did I kill him? Of course not!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No, did you fuck him?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You don’t think so? You either did or your
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I don’t remember. We kissed at my door and
next thing I knew I woke up with my period. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Did you get smashed or what? You have to
eat if you’re drinking. And not just those little salads.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I ate a burger in the afternoon and a steak
and a half with Gregory.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I guess you’re off that vegetarian kick
you’ve been on for ten years.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I couldn’t stop eating steak. I felt out of
control – like I was making up for all those years being a vegetarian. I
couldn’t get enough. And then Gregory walked me home… and he peed in
front of me.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What? Why the hell did he do that?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: He was trying to get into my apartment and… I
know this sounds gross but I was so turned on. I grabbed him and kissed
him!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: And then?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I think I went in and fell asleep. I guess
Gregory walked home and got killed! I blacked out.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: At least your PMS is over.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: And my bra finally fits again.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I thought you were going to stop wearing
your glasses.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: My vision got worse again.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Are those Mark’s?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, Mark wears boxers. They must have been in
the dryer already.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Uh huh… good thing those cops didn’t see
that.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: He was cute, huh? Of course whenever I meet a
guy, I’m wearing no make-up.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Rule one: always wear make-up.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I wonder if he’s married.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: He wasn’t wearing a ring. But you don’t
want to date a cop Frida. They’re so blue collar.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I didn’t trust her. All that blood on the
sheets. She may look sweet, but she could be a wolf in sheep’s clothing.
Something’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That dude was torn limb from limb. No way a
woman like that could have done it. You never seen blood on a chick’s
sheets from her period?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hell no, I’m not into that shit. The sight of
blood makes me sick.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, so you decide to be a cop? Seriously? You
don’t have sex with a woman cause she’s on the rag?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: No man. Blood is not a turn on. You sure let
that Frida off the hook. You weren’t even going to take the sheets. If I
didn’t know better, I’d think you liked her.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can tell she’s not a killer. You just don’t
like her cause you have a hang up about menstruation.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Nah, man, I’m just saying, you should never
date a woman who was the last one to see a guy alive.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Your nails are so tough and pointy. What
is this stuff under them?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Ignore it. It’s probably my mom.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Hi it’s Frida. Leave a message!</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Frida, Frida, Frida. I get so hot thinking
about yesterday. My scratches have almost healed and I’m ready for
more.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Gross, so this is Mark’s flesh? When did
you see him?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Um, he stopped by yesterday before you came
over.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me? You said you
hadn’t seen him for a month.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t want you to think I was
still a doormat.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, I’m your friend. I’m not judging
you… You didn’t sleep with the creep did you?</p>
<p><strong>mr. grant</strong>: Find me that “Woman in Jeopardy”
story.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: How about a “Man in Jeopardy” story?</p>
<p><strong>mr. grant</strong>: Did you change your hair?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I had the strangest dream – that I was really
hungry, and I was chasing someone… I think I was some sort of animal.
And my sex drive… it’s embarrassing but I’ve had these sexual dreams
too.</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: Anything about bestiality?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Frida’s sheets checked out fine. It was just
her own blood. From her… you know.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I told you she was innocent.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Hey, there was a lot of blood.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She was never a suspect Lloyd. Some animal
must have done this.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I checked all the zoos. No missing animals.
You think a pitbull?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Maybe. What about all those hairs they found
on his body?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Waiting for DNA tests. He was hairier than
Madonna in Penthouse.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Madonna’s in Penthouse?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Back in the ’80’s. You didn’t see the
pictures? They were from before she got famous. She was hairy as hell.
Her pits, her bush.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hairy women are kind of sexy. Women in their
natural state.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: And you think I’m sick?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Thank you for your submission of “Woman on
the Tracks.” Although the story of a woman being rescued by Fabio after
being tied to the train tracks is indeed the kind of lame ass “Women in
Jeopardy” genre that my company seeks, I cannot of sound mind pass this
script on to anyone. In a nutshell: it sucks.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Wait. Mr. Grant.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Mr. Grant.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I can’t read any more crap. These women are
all victims.</p>
<p><strong>mr. grant</strong>: Yes, that’s what we’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I think we should do something with strong
female characters…</p>
<p><strong>mr. grant</strong>: I’ll make a note of that. Put the
coverage on my desk.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: That bite healed up quickly. It’s been about
three weeks?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Nearly four.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: How have you been feeling?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Okay, but I’m worried about the next PMS
bout. It’s gotten worse. I’m not myself during it. I get bloated,
irritable, my breasts get huge, my nails turn into claws, my teeth get
sharper and I have more facial and body hair.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Sounds all stress related. Your teeth may
feel sharper if you’re grinding them at night. You don’t seem hairy to
me. Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I get crazy dreams and I black out.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Diet and exercise, that’s all there is. I’m
not a big proponent of the PMS craze, but there’s a book my wife
mentioned called “The PMS Diet,” which may be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Does she have PMS?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Now it’s menopause. She’s always hot. I
gotta wear a parka around the house cause she keeps it so cold. It’s
always something.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You busted me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Are you following me?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No… no… this is embarrassing. I was returning
your pillowcase… and I saw you cross the street… and I sort of started
following you. I just find you really intriguing. I don’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Intriguing?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I gotta get going. Peter gets the pillowcase
out of his bag.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: At least let me give you this back. I washed
it.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: What’s going on Frida?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Where’d you get the bike?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’m kinda borrowing it. Who’s this,
Mr. Date-Guy?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, this is Peter. He’s a cop.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Oh, hi, uh, Pete. Gotta run Frida.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Being a cop has such a warm effect on
people.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: That’s my ex. He’s an asshole. In case you
couldn’t tell. I think he’s been following me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: There’s a lot of that going around.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You wanna get some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m trying to stay away from caffeine.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Some decaf then? That was stupid. Obviously
you said you were staying away from caffeine as a nice way of blowing me
off.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No. Really. I don’t drink coffee anymore. I
used to love it but my tastes have changed recently.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay well. Maybe some other time. They
continue walking together.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So what book did you buy?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh, it’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No really, I love knowing what people
read.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I can forgive you a bestseller.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: My mom used to get PMS too.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Used to? Did it stop finally?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, she died when I was twelve.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ve had time to get over it. She was killed
by wolves they think.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh my god, by wolves?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We lived in northern Minnesota. She went for
a walk one night and they never found her body – just her torn apart
clothes with her blood and wolf blood on them. Then the town rounded up
bunch of hunters and shot all the wolves in the area.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m so sorry Peter. Gee, that sure puts my
problems in perspective.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The weird thing is I’ve had an odd, morbid
fascination with wolves ever since.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’ve read scripts about detectives, but never
met one. Must be wild.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sometimes it’s frustrating. Like this Gregory
Jameson case. We don’t even know what killed him. I’m putting together
little details to see if we’re missing something.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know how moms always tell you to wear
clean underwear in case you’re in an accident? Well this guy wasn’t
wearing any underwear.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: A lot of people don’t wear underwear.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah but a guy hung like a horse would need
briefs to keep things in line.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sorry. Sometimes I’m a bit frank.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: How about you? Briefs or boxers?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Briefs.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Cool. I don’t get guys who wear boxers. My ex
wore boxers. I never got how he could wear khakis and not have his
boxers bunch up.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Me neither. That’s why I wear briefs… So why
did you and… Mark break up?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: He’s bad news. He cheated on me, he insults
me. Now suddenly he gets jealous if I have a date.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I really gotta get going.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks for the walk. Maybe we could… get a
bite sometime?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yeah. Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I don’t think I’ve ever actually liked anyone
I’ve dated before. Peter even likes me without makeup.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hmmm. Sounds suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I don’t know much about him. How do you know
if a guy is decent?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Give him the tampon test.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What the hell is the tampon test?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You’re at his place, and you come out of
the bathroom looking all shy and say, “I’m so embarrassed but could you
run out and get me some tampons?” If he says no, he’s too embarrassed,
then you know he’s a wus. If he says he’s got some in the bathroom, then
you know there are other women around a lot. But if he says yes and goes
to get you tampons, well then he’s a decent guy. Then, while he’s
out…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: … you search his apartment. Look for drugs
in his medicine cabinet, look for pictures of women, look for bank
statements.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I didn’t know what kind to get.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So I got one of each.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What are those?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Silver bullets. A collectors item. These are
very valuable. They were melted down from a crucifix.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What are they for?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh just my wolf paraphernalia. Some people
collect beanie babies… I collect silver bullets.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So… did you rummage through my stuff while I
was gone?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m a cop – I notice everything. That
drawer’s ajar, that picture’s been moved about an inch, the closet
wasn’t closed when I left…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Okay, you busted me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, nothing’s wrong. Just… well don’t you
have your period?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: My period? No.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: But… what were those tampons for?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh, yes, you’re right. I guess I got carried
away in the moment.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I mean we can still… whatever… Maybe I should
get a towel?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No. No, I’m fine. Maybe I should go. I mean…
I don’t want our first time to be like this.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Frida, wait. Don’t go. We can just sleep. I
just want to wake up with you.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I have to go. I’m not good at
relationships.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m freaking out. I’m like an animal and
totally out of control. My arms keep getting really hairy.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You have to stop being so self- critical
Frida.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I looked like an Italian man!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: How’d it go with the cop?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: We almost slept together… and… then the hair
started and I booked.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, this hair thing is all in your
head. You’re using it as an excuse not to get close to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It’s just as well. I’m afraid of getting hurt
again. Mark seemed great at first too. I don’t want to get too attached
to Peter and then find out he’s a creep.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hey, Carlton’s in town – come out with the
three of us.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Carlton hated me.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No he didn’t. Come on, I don’t want to be
alone with those two. All they talk about is basketball and it bores the
hell out of me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Okay. I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Great. George is meeting Carlton first for
drinks. We can meet and go together. It’ll be a blast.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Come on, I’ve been working with Frida.
Carlton won’t even recognize her now. She’s really coming out of her
shell.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’s just so… pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: She’s just insecure. Once you get to know
her she’s fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: She’ll talk about PMS and stare at her
salad.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I started out on that eye-of-newt diet the
doctor gave me and wound up in the tub covered in chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well whatever it was, seems to have worked
cause you look great.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You’re just saying that.</p>
<p><strong>cute guy</strong>: Hey there beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I think he called you beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh my god. I’ve never had that before. I’ve
had guys say they want me to suck their dicks and gross stuff but no
one’s ever said “Hey there beautiful.”</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Guess you like those Coyote Ugly steaks
now, huh?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Sorry, don’t mean to be wolfing down. I’m
just starving.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Don’t apologize. It’s great to see a woman
really enjoying her food. I hate it when I buy a woman dinner and she
won’t even touch it.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah Jen here’s always dieting and eating
like a bird.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: No one I’ve run into knows what “coyote
ugly” means.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Maybe that bartender made it up. I mean I
think coyotes are rather beautiful. Maybe “coyote ugly” is really a
compliment. Like someone who’s conventionally “ugly” but is really
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Yeah that’s like a three bagger. Today a
bag is also a condom, so now a three bagger can be a chick that’s really
hot. So hot you gotta put several condoms on to dull the senses.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Charming Carlton.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It is so hot in here.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Bag means condom now? I can’t keep up with
the word “bag.” It used to be “No, that’s not my bag” – meaning not my
thing. But now “my bag” means “my fault.”</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I still thought it was a purse.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You forgot the verb. To bag. “I want to bag
her.”</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yeah but does that mean fuck her or kill her?
Like a body bag?</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Waiter! She needs more water.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Can we get some service here?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You might want to tape your nipples down
next time. It’s really distracting.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I can’t help it. My bra wouldn’t even fit.
I’ve been going to Victoria’s Secret and exchanging bras for bigger ones
and still I’m busting out. It’s this PMS.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Geez, I wish I’d get it like that.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No you don’t, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh my god, look. My arms are so hairy!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No they’re not.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yes they are! Look how much more hair I have
than you!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It’s just cause mine is finer. A little
bleach’ll fix that.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I look like fuckin’ Chewbacca.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: No way is that the same chick. The other
one was a dog.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Jennifer gave her a make-over.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Looks like a helluva lot more than a
make-over. Was there surgery involved?</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Sorry I didn’t recognize you earlier. You
look so different.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’ve changed a lot lately.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You shouldn’t smoke. It’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Yeah yeah I know. Smoking kills. I’ll quit
someday. Doesn’t it seem like all the cool people smoke?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: James Dean, Humphrey Bogart…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yul Brynner. They’re all dead.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Yeah but they looked cool…</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: As James Dean said, “Live fast, die young,
and leave a good-looking corpse.”</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Your lips look delicious.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Wow your body’s really hot.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’ve been working out.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: I mean body temperature. Do you have a
fever?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Never felt better.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Frida? Was it something I said?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I wonder how Frida and Carlton are getting
along?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Carlton insisted on leaving with her. Maybe
he got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So now being with Frida is lucky? I
thought you said she was a flake.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Well the flake got a lot hotter.</p>
<p><strong>carlton</strong>: Frida? Is this some sort of game? Here
Frida… Here girl….</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Holy shit, holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Let it ring.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: George, I need to talk to Jennifer. It’s an
emergency.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: George? Is she there?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: It’s for you. Frida.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Tell her I’m eating.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, this is a bad time. We’re having
sex and George actually answered the phone.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: There is a man’s arm in my bed.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, you are not coyote ugly. Everyone
was drooling over you last night. Including George.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Jennifer. A severed arm. It’s bloody and… I’m
not sure but it may be Carlton’s.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You fucked Carlton? See I told you he
liked you.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No! Not fucked him, I think I killed him.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Please come over. I’m begging you. What
should I do with the arm? Should I call the cops or… Peter?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, you’re not making sense. I can’t
come over right now.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida’s hallucinating. Her PMS is out of
control.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Jennifer?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No it’s mom.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: We’re worried about you. “60 Minutes” was on
same-sex couples.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What does that have to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You haven’t mentioned dating anyone since
Mark and, well you’re not a lesbian are you?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, I’m not a lesbian. Geez mom.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s okay if you are, we just want to know.
I don’t want to be expecting grandchildren if…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I gotta go. My sink is clogged.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Frida?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh my god, you scared the shit out of me. You
following me again?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. I was doing my laundry.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m sorry – I’m on edge today.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Shit, where’s my Michigan shirt?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Was there anything in that washer?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No. Nope, nothing in it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You sure? It’s my favorite shirt, mind if I
check?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: NO! I… I checked when I put my stuff in. I
always look through the washer first.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh… okay well maybe I lost it somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey, I’m sorry if things got a little heavy
the other…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah? Uh huh… What? Torn to bits? Jesus
Christ. Okay I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: A man killed in Central Park.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So where’s this infamous arm now?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I put it down the garbage disposal.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: And what makes you think you killed a
man?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Because of PMS, I get hairy, my nails turn
into claws, I eat raw meat, I roam the city hunting for flesh. I’ve
become a werewolf!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You’re a PMS werewolf. Of course. Frida,
are you on drugs?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, last night I think I chased Carlton
around as a wolf and killed him. I woke up with a taste of blood in my
mouth and a severed arm in my bed. And my throat hurts.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You’re delusional. Maybe you had a bad
dream and bit your lip – so you tasted blood. And the severed arm… well
I don’t see it and… maybe this is all in your head.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It took me an hour to clean it up. That was
not in my head!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Maybe the blood was from your period like
before.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I haven’t gotten it yet.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, listen to yourself. If I said I was
a werewolf, would you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I don’t know. You have to take Sammy. He’s
afraid of me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I think I’m a werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: Let’s explore this. What makes you feel
you’re a werewolf?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I ate a guy last night.</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: And how did you feel when you ate this
guy?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t remember doing it.</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: Dreams about killing usually signify
feelings of guilt. You had sex last night and you feel guilty.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: We didn’t have sex.</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: You say you killed a man and don’t remember
it. Couldn’t you have had sex and not remember it? It’s sexual. Why did
you choose “eating him” as the method of killing?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Cause I’m a fucking werewolf!!</p>
<p><strong>shrink</strong>: You use the word “fucking.” You’re
sexualizing things. Stop berating yourself. It’s okay to have sex.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m supposed to put up with a fuckin’ cat
I’m allergic to cause your friend’s got PMS?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: It’s so bad she becomes a werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You have some weird friends. What does her
thinking she’s a werewolf have to do with us having the cat?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Don’t be stupid George. Obviously if she’s
a werewolf, she can’t be around a cat. She might eat it and besides,
cats are afraid of wolves.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Oh great. What the fuck am I supposed to
do?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Take some allergy medicine.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You can’t believe this bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: She’s my best friend. I gotta be there for
her – no matter how crazy it sounds. I’ve been in some bad relationships
and she’s been there for me. She’s lonely. If pretending she’s a
werewolf helps, then more power to her.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Do we have any tuna?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Are you George McCracken?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: They’re police detectives.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, I’m George McCracken.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’re here about Carlton Fraser.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Your address was in his pocket.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yeah, we were out last night. What happened?
Was he in an accident?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He was found nearly ripped to shreds in
Central Park.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: And he was missing an arm.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: When’s the last time you saw Carlton?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: After dinner, he left with Jen’s friend,
Frida.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Frida Harris? Was she dating him?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No, heavens no. They’re just… friends.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Uh… do you know any enemies Carlton might
have?</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Is Frida your real name or just what you
tell guys you meet at clubs?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It’s Frida. Frida the FREAK.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Having trouble sticking it in?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: The lights bother my eyes. Can we turn them
off? SPENCER But you’re so beautiful. I want to look at you.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Ummmm… you smell good.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Are all these your guitars?</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Are those your real breasts?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Why don’t you decide for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You’re not too drunk, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida… pick up the phone…</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: It’s sexier with the lights on.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I prefer the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: God, your nails are sharp.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Is this all you have? SPENCER Give it a few
min… Oh yeah, nibble on my ear.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: The better to see you with.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: I love it when you bite me. Ouch, shit.
Damn, that hurt.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I still don’t get when you gave her back the
pillowcase.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We only live a few blocks apart.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: This is more than fishy, this chick dates a
dude and he winds up dead.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay Lloyd, you tell me how she killed
them.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: She’s got a hidden pitbull. Maybe she hired
someone to kill them.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She’s not a suspect. What is her motive?
There’s nothing, NOTHING connecting her to either crime except that she
dated both guys.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Sounds like you got a conflict of
interest.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You take the cake Lloyd. Come on, she’s not
here. Let’s check out her psycho ex.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: How do you know about her psycho ex?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Wolf! Wolf!</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida? I was worried to death about you.
I’ve called you for two days. Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’ve been here. What day is it?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Tuesday. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Shit, I guess I missed work.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, Carlton’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: And he was missing an arm.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh my god Jennifer. I should go to
confession.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Relax. Carlton was torn apart. No way
could you have done that. Maybe you saw someone kill him and blocked it
out… or…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Someone’s at my door. Maybe it’s the
cops.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Frida? I hear you talking. I know you’re in
there. Let me in.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It’s Mark.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Get rid of him!</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Okay, I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I’m stopping by later. I’m worried about
you. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: It’s a matter of life and death.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: This really isn’t a good time.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Come on Frida, I’m not kidding. I’m totally
fucked. Let me in.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I did something stupid. I had a courier job –
picking up a package from the airport. It turned out to be money – so I
kind of borrowed it to pay my rent and now these dudes are after me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: So pay them back and apologize.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: These guys aren’t the kind that’ll take an
apology. They’re the kind that’ll break my thumbs.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You think that story’s gonna make me loan you
money?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: It’s the truth. If you’d just loaned me the
money last time this never would have happened.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Somehow this winds up being my fault? You
always blame me.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Come on, I’m your biggest supporter.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: My bra is my biggest supporter.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I just need a place to lay low for a few days.
Come on, I know you hate me but you can’t wanna see me at the bottom of
the East River?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Do I smell? Can I take a shower?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m not feeling too well all of the sudden.
Go take your shower.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Mark.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Take your shower.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Shit what happened to you? What’s all over
you?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Holy shit, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Did you get rid of Mark?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I don’t know… I’m spaced out… he was taking a
shower… He must be still in there.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: He’s been here all night?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yeah, I guess. Mark?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, we need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Oh god, did I do that?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Let’s get him into the bathtub.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay, so tell me again about that werewolf
thing…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: If there’s gonna be a bloody mess, at
least it’s in the bathtub. We’ll just hose him off till the blood runs
out.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What happened to his tooth?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter
is the police!</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: DON’T call the police.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Why not? There’s been a murder.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: First of all, you’re my alibi. I told
George I was with you last night.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What? Why’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: There’s kind of this guy I’m seeing.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You’re cheating on George? Jennifer, how
could you?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: How could I? I’m helping you clean up
Mark’s remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You’re right. It’s just, I can’t cover up a
murder so George won’t know you’re cheating.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You say murder, but you have no idea what
happened. You don’t remember doing it, so it’s out of your control.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I think I turned into a werewolf and killed
him.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Why the fuck would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I could smell another woman on him.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: If you ask me, the fucker got what he
deserved. I’m glad he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: That’s a terrible thing to say. Frida goes
back to scrubbing the floor.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay, let’s say that this is PMS- related.
You think those male cops are going to understand that? You’ll either be
locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep
this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the
dude in the park.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: The park dude was missing an arm.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And
his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some
mutherfucker’s about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin’
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Deal. And if some mutherfucker’s about to
blow me away, shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Yeah okay. I still say Frida’s involved.
She’s the last one to see two dudes alive…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: She wasn’t the last one to see them alive.
Whoever killed them was.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: At least I finally saw the reason you
couldn’t get over Mark.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You should have seen it erect.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You expecting someone?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Fuck it’s the cops. Peter saw me, now I have
to let him in.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Tell them you’ll meet them outside.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Uh…. hi!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to
you. It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Uh… the buzzer’s broken. I’ll be down in a
second.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What the fuck are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hide him.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: The refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Go downstairs and stall them.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Hi guys. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I thought I heard someone coming.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh shit, wrong floor.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I was thinking about becoming a cop
myself. Do you take a test or something or just sign up?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Why would you want to be a cop?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I don’t know, I guess the outfits are
cool. And I want a big gun.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida? It’s us… Jennifer and the nice
detectives.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Hi guys! What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We need to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You heard about Carlton Fraser?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yes, Jennifer told me. What does that have to
do with me?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You had a date with Carlton?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: It wasn’t a date. Jennifer invited me along
to dinner with them.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Seems you were the last to see Carlton alive.
And the last to see Gregory alive.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What makes you think I was the last one?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He means the last that we know of.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: This one walk you home too?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No. We left the restaurant, and… and I felt
sick… so… so I took a cab home. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You got a dog?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, I have a cat.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: How big?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You okay Lloyd?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He needs some water.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’re considering Mark Wilson a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: He’s got a record. Drug charges. Avoided jail
on pleas. Plus a woman four years ago had a restraining order against
him.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: See he was cheating from the get go.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He’s been running money for the Mafia.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No he’s not. He’s a courier. He picks up
packages from the airport.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Packages of money.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Seems he’s stolen money from them. He’s
desperate and our only lead.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: One of our only leads… You had dates with
both men right before they were killed.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Am I a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, no… But Mark – a jealous boyfriend gone
mad. Maybe he kills men you date.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Mark wouldn’t hurt a fly.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida, you have to admit, he is a bit cold
at times. And last time you saw him, he was quite torn apart.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: But you said the bodies were ripped to
pieces?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Still haven’t figured out how he or anyone
else pulled that off. Never seen anything like it.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Do you know Spencer Hale? East Village
musician?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, why?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: He was ripped to shreds also. In his
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Mark’s an East Village musician. He
probably knows Spencer.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Interesting. We’ll have to check that
out.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This is probably the strangest case we’ve
ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Peter knows something.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Well if he does, he didn’t give you away.
He must really like you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Spencer’s the key here. Frida is in no way
associated with him. And her blood hasn’t matched with any of the
killings.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: It’s a bit farfetched that Mark would rip
guys to shreds just outta jealousy. This makes no sense.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: It’s like some fucking monster dropped out of
the sky and killed these dudes.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Like a vampire or some shit?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Jesus Christ what are we gonna do? We can’t
bury him around here.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay, we put him in his car trunk. We
drive it to a “No Parking” area where we know it’ll be towed. The tow
truck will come and take it to a huge lot. No one’s gonna claim it.
It’ll sit there for a long time. By the time anyone discovers a body in
it, it’ll be all decomposed and we’ll have thought of better alibis by
then.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I think I just got my period.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Does that mean this whole thing is
over?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Probably for three weeks or so anyway. I’m
not sure – I don’t get how it works.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Let’s do some research. I’ll check the
libraries. You surf the web.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You’re such a good friend.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: So are you. Look, go about your life. Act
like nothing’s wrong. We’ll get to the bottom of this.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Mr. Grant. Did you read that script I was
talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mr. grant</strong>: Uh… yes. Not for us. No woman in
jeopardy. Find me Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Find me a true story about a
crazed killer stalking beautiful women.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mr. grant</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No. I quit. Take your lame ass ideas, your
fake ass toupee, your fat ass wife and your ugly ass kids and shove
them.</p>
<p><strong>mr. grant</strong>: Very well then. Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Frida. I was looking for you. You changing
jobs?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yeah sort of. Where’s Lloyd?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I need to talk to you. About us. Frida… I…
Can I carry your box?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, I got it. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I thought we were starting something… and
then… I know it’s unorthodox, I mean with you being involved in the case
and all.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I just don’t know if I should be dating
anyone right now.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yeah, every guy you date winds up dead.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Except Mark of course.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Did I tell you I have the worst sense of
humor and I make bad jokes at totally inappropriate times?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, but thanks for the warning.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Speaking of Mark – we’ve tried to track him
down and there’s no sight of him. Vanished into thin air. I got a hunch
he fled the country.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Interesting possibility.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Lemme give you a ride. You can’t take the
subway with that box.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Symptoms include loss of emotional
control, compulsive behavior, cravings, crying spells…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Peter keeps asking me out.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Maybe you should go out with him. If you
keep avoiding him he’ll get suspicious. Besides, what better way to not
get busted than to date the cop who’s investigating you.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: The thing is, I really like him. I finally
meet a guy I really like and I’m a fuckin’ werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: We don’t know you’re a werewolf. It might
never happen again. You have to get on with your life.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Frida, wait. I thought you were an animal
person.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I don’t know what came over me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I need to tell you something. It’s about…
PMS. I get it real bad.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: That’s it? Hell my mom chased my dad around
with a knife when she had it. She made us call her a different name.
She’d say, “You’re talking to Betty now” and we’d leave the house for a
few days.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: This is a lot worse than “Betty.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You can’t mean that. I’m sure your bark is
worse than your bite.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, my bite’s a lot worse.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Whatever it is, we can work it out. Frida, I
love you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Is it that funny?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No, it’s just… no one’s ever said that. And I
thought if someone did ever say it, I’d have to say it first and then
they’d sort of say “I love you too” cause they felt they had to after
I’d said it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Is that how you feel?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Like I had to say it? No, I wanted to say
it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You didn’t say it.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’s with the squirt guns?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: They’re for my cat. I use them to train him
not to rip up paper.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You know, I’ve never seen your cat.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I loaned him to Jennifer. George moved out
and she was lonely…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Whatever you do, don’t tell me you have to
leave.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay. I won’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: You think mafia hit?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hard to tell. Looks like he’s been cleaned up
and he’s decomposing as we speak. This case gets weirder by the
minute.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: It has to be Frida. This makes three guys
ripped apart who are tied to her ass.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Okay Lloyd. First, no way does Frida have the
physical strength to tear a guy to shreds. Second, why would she be so
obvious and let it be known she was the last one to see these guys?
Third, she’s the one in danger. She’s a woman in jeopardy and you’re
layin’ a murder rap on her. Fourth, I look in her eyes and know she’s no
killer.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: And fifth, you’re dating her.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: I know. I followed you. To the zoo, to her
house, to your house…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What the fuck are you following me for? I’m
not a suspect here.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Which brings up an interesting point. I
wasn’t following you. I was following the suspect. And you just happened
to be there…</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: “Paranoia, insecurity, depression, changes in
vision, feelings of losing control; belief that you have a mental
problem…” Nothing about turning into a werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Check out what I found.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I found it in this out-of-the-way used
bookstore.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: This is from a scientist in France, Madame
Sconce. “The original werewolves were females. They became werewolves on
the lunar cycle because it corresponded to the woman’s cycle. My
suspicion is that the only cure is true love.”</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Great so all I have to do is fall in love?
Like I haven’t tried that for the past 24 years.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: “The female-cycle werewolf will only kill
men and never kills someone she truly loves.” See I knew you never loved
Mark.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Who is this Madame Sconce? Let’s find her and
talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: She died at age 34 in the 1800’s. They
thought she was crazy. She was banished from her town. Seems her husband
shot her.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Guess she never found true love.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: The weird thing is… he shot her with a
silver bullet.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: So… she was a werewolf. Do you think we can
believe all this?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: What choice do we have?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: So what do I do?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Fall in love.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I think I already have.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Your breasts feel larger.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: They do? Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No, it’s a good thing. I like it. Everything
about you is great. I like how you don’t shave your legs. Women are so
much sexier when they’re natural.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I did shave… Do I seem hairy? Peter
laughs.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No. But I don’t mind hairy. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I… I should just get up. I have lots to do
today…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I gotta get downtown.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I have… a lot of… cleaning to do today.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ll call you later.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I was just wondering… a person has a choice
between killing themselves or killing others, which is worse? I mean you
fry in hell either way, right?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: If you kill yourself, you won’t be around to
ask for forgiveness or to make a last confession, whereas if you kill
others, you can go to confession, do penance, and be absolved from your
sins.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: But if the person is killing several people,
then maybe it’s better to kill oneself cause then the killing stops.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: You have a point. Hmmm… I’ve never been
asked this before… Who is being killed? Catholics? Homosexuals?
Protestants?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Ugh! I can’t even kill myself!!</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yes silver bullets. Do you have any silver
bullets? I only need a few. No this is not a joke…</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida? You there? Remember, you gave me a
key for emergencies? I consider this an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh god Frida, don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m cleaning my stove.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You scared the shit out of me. I thought
you were killing yourself.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I tried to kill myself – earlier. It doesn’t
work. I think I need silver bullets. So I got depressed and when I’m
depressed I clean.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: You’ll get through this. You were fine for
over three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m just afraid I’ll hurt Peter. I think I
love him.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Remember what Madame Sconce said. If you
love him he’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: But how do I know if I really love Peter? And
if he really loves me?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I guess you’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No. I can’t take that chance. I’d rather kill
myself.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No. I won’t let you do that.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: The werewolf always dies at the end. Didn’t
you see “American Werewolf in London?”</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: I think George knows.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: About Mark? Carlton?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: About Benito.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Did I kill a guy named Benito?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: No, he’s the guy I’m having an affair
with.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I thought you and George were getting
married.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: We were – I was just so tempted… It was
sort of a test. I think after sleeping with Benito I know I want to be
with George. But now George knows about Benito and he doesn’t want to be
with me!</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I wish I only had your problems.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Sorry – I shouldn’t go on about myself at
a time like this. Are you sure you’re going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yes, just check on me once a day for the next
three days. Then the PMS should be over.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Okay, just nail shut this door behind me.
I’ll call you later.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I don’t deserve a friend like you.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Yes you do.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Frida? You okay? Look, I think I know what
happened to Mark. I want to help. I’m coming over.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: NO! Don’t come over. Peter… I… I don’t want
to see you anymore. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What? Is there someone else?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Yes, sort of. I mean no, not really.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes or no? Frida, can’t you just be honest
with me?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You at least owe me the truth.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: You want the truth? Remember I tried to tell
you something the other day?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Yes, your PMS. Frida I can deal with
that.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No you can’t. It… it gets so bad that I
become a werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: If you don’t like me, just say so. You don’t
have to make up some bullshit like you’re a werewolf.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I knew you wouldn’t believe me! Just go away.
Go very far away!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey Lloyd.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: My girlfriend’s predicting another murder in
the next few days.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What makes her think that?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: She says she’s on the rag every time I get
called in to investigate a murder.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So… they’re on some cycle. The murders…
Gregory… then 28 days later… Carlton.</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: And that was 28 days ago today.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Did we get those DNA tests back?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Just this morning. Animal hairs were found
all over the victims.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What kind of animal?</p>
<p><strong>lloyd</strong>: Can’t figure out the species. Similar to a
wolf. They’re jokin’ at the lab that a werewolf probably killed him.
Ain’t that the stupidest thing you ever heard?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Go away. I might hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m not afraid. Frida! I love you.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Peter I love you too but…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think you’ll hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I don’t think you would. No matter what form
you take.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I can’t take that chance… I couldn’t live
with myself if I did anything to you.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I have the silver bullets in case I need to
protect myself. Does that make you feel better?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Be careful!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Can’t you bite me and then I’ll be like
you?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: No. It doesn’t work that way. Men can’t get
PMS. Unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m staying here with you tonight. There’s no
getting rid of me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Promise to shoot me if I attack you.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Can you order up some chocolate?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I knew you wouldn’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Maybe we should have children. I don’t think
I’d kill the father of my child.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We can work this out. Other couples have
worse problems.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Worse than this?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sure. Cheating, lying. What’s a little
werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you
can feed off deer.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: What about… those guys… I might have…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No way can anything be proved. All they have
are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: I’m so sorry… I… I couldn’t help it. You know
I didn’t mean to… to do any of that.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I know. The important thing is that it
stop.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Truce?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Truce.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’m going to take a shower.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Peter?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Thanks. For everything.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Frida? You okay?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Never been better. Peter spent the night. I
must really love him. He’s still alive.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Oh thank god. Maybe this whole thing is
really over.</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: God I hope so. Hey can I call you later?
Peter’s still here. He’s in the shower.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: Sure. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>jennifer</strong>: In the shower?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Peter? Peter?</p>
<p><strong>frida</strong>: Here’s a towel.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Hey Frida?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Wanna join me?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Want me to do your back?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Doesn’t this feel great?</p>
