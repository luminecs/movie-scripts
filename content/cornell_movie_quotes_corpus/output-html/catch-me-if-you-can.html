<p><strong>music up:</strong>: A simple GAME SHOW SET – one long
desk-that houses four “CELEBRITY PANELISTS,” a small pulpit with
attached microphone for the host, BUD COLLYER, who walks through the
curtain to the delight of the audience. Bud bows and waves to the
celebrities – ORSON BEAN, KITTY CARLISLE, TOM POSTON, and</p>
<p><strong>bud collyer</strong>: Hello, panel, and welcome everyone to
another exciting day on “To Tell The Truth.” Let’s get the show
started.</p>
<p><strong>the curtain starts to rise</strong>: BRIGHT LIGHTS SHINE on
the faces of THREE MEN who walk toward center stage. All thre n wear
identical AIRLINE PILOT UNIFORMS, each with m; c ng blue blazers and
caps. Gentleman, please state your names.</p>
<p><strong>pilot #1</strong>: My name is Frank Abagnale Jr. THE PILOT IN
THE MIDDLE steps forward.</p>
<p><strong>pilot #2</strong>: My name is Frank Abagnale Jr. THE THIRD
PILOT does the same.</p>
<p><strong>pilot #3</strong>: My name is Frank Abagnale Jr. Bud smiles,
grabs a piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>bud collyer</strong>: Panel, listen to this one. My name is
Frank Abagnale Jr, and some people consider me the worlds greatest
imposter.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>1 continued: 1</strong>: As Bud reads, the CAMERA SLOWLY PANS
the faces of the three</p>
<p><strong>pilots.</strong>: BUD COLLYER</p>
<p>****: From 1964 to 1966 I successfully impersonated an airline pilot
for Pan Am Airlines, and flew over two million miles for free. During
that time I was also the Chief Resident Pediatrician at a Georgia
hospital, the Assistant Attorney General for the state of Louisiana, and
a Professor of American History at a prestigious University in France.
By the time I was caught and sentenced to prison, I had cashed over six
million dollars in fraudulent checks in 26 foreign countries and all
fifty states, and I did it all before my 18th birthday. To this day, I
am the only teenager ever to have been placed on the FBI’ s most wanted
list. My name is a Abagna l e Jr. Warm applause as the THREE MEN walk
behind a desk that faces the pa They all sit down at exactly the same
time.</p>
<p><strong>kitty carlisle</strong>: Imposter number one, how many years
were you in prison?</p>
<p><strong>pilot #1</strong>: I served two years in France, and five
years in Atlanta, Georgia.</p>
<p><strong>kitty carlisle</strong>: Imposter number two, I find all this
very fascinating. Who was it that finally caught you?</p>
<p><strong>slowly push in on the pilot in the middle –</strong>: A thin
smile across his lips as he faces the panel – his manicured hands out in
front of him on the desk – his back</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>1 continued: 1</strong>: straight in his chair – his cap
pulled slightly forward on his head – the way pilots like to wear
them.</p>
<p><strong>super: marseille, france december 25, 1967</strong>: A heavy
rain falls on JOE SHAPE, 40’s, who wears a black hat and holds a black
umbrella as he bangs on the window of a small GUARDHOUSE in front of a
LARGE GATED PRISON. Joe is sneezing as he holds up an IDENTIFICATION
CARD TO THE GUARD.</p>
<p><strong>joe shape</strong>: Joe Shaye, FBI.</p>
<p><strong>joe shape</strong>: I have orders see a prisoner named
Abagnale, t e his statement and solicit a c n ^ n so I can prepare for
tomorrow’ tladition. Joe takes a roll of CASH out of h` ocket, casually
slips the money to the Warden.</p>
<p><strong>joe shape</strong>: If I give you another twenty, will you
turn up the heat in here?</p>
<p><strong>warden garren</strong>: Don’t pass him anything through
the</p>
<p><strong>hole-</strong>: Garren walks off, and Joe immediately starts
to smile, looking around for a long BEAT as he stares at the cell
door.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Yoohoo. Hello? Is the lady of the house
at home? Joe tries to control his excitement as he kneels down and looks
through the metal slide hole.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Jesus, Frank, you look terrible. I heard
about French prisons, but this is positively barbaric. dthe cell, and
then heavy coughing. JO,E YE That doesn’ t o d little cold my Help
me.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Help you? Yes, I’ll help you, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>n</strong>: Why do you think I’ve been fighting to have you
extradited. Why do you think I came to take you home? Do you know that
21 other countries want’you in their prisons? I saw the list – Egypt was
on there. Who the hell goes to Egypt to write bad checks?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sick… please…</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Don’t worry, Frank, you just have to make
it through one more night. And then tomorrow I’ll help you onto a plane,
clean you up, and put you in a cell for the next twenty-five years.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>close on frank abagnale jr.</strong>: His face covered by a
beard and matted black hair. Frank closes his eyes and starts to
cough.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Help me, please. I can’t breathe…</p>
<p><strong>outside the cell</strong>: Joe listens to Frank, who is
coughing so hard he starts to choke.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can’t… breathe…</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Don’t start this shit, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can’t …Can’t Joe looks through the slot i e11
door, but can only see faint images of Frank rol the floor holding
his</p>
<p><strong>throat-</strong>: JOE SHAYE Frank, what’s happening? Damn it,
just calm down! Somebody help me!!</p>
<p><strong>the cell door is thrown open</strong>: Frank is being dragged
across the floor by Warden Garren and a second GUARD, each holding an
arm as they drag Frank’s emaciated six-foot frame through the halls. Joe
Shaye jogs behind the guards.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: He’s not breathing. I think he stopped
breathing! Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: What’s happening to him? Garren and the
Guard quickly move toward a sink, where they start to wash their hands.
JOE SHAYE What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>assistant warden garren</strong>: Washing off the lice.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye-</strong>: He can’t breath. You have to call a
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>stant warden garren</strong>: The doctor p fnl’sf in the
morning. You can’t just t him die. I have orders from the Embassy! This
man is going t tradited to the United State am holding you responsible
if ant happens! Suddenly Garren looks past Shaye – eyeing the curtain
that partially encloses Frank’s bed. Garren slowly moves toward the
curtain, pushes it open.</p>
<p><strong>close on garren</strong>: drawing his gun and sprinting out
the open door of the infirmary, yelling in French for the Guard to
follow. Joe Shaye stands motionless, staring down in horror at the empty
bed. JOE SHAYE Oh, shit.. .Frank!</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>8 continued: 8</strong>: a thin smile on his lips as he tries
to move his starved legs toward the main door. As Frank makes his way
past a row of cheering prisoners, he trips and falls, his body too weak
to run as he starts to crawl across the prison floor. Joe and Garren
easily catch up to him, Garren quickly kneeling down and holding his gun
against Frank’s head –cocking the weapon. Frank stops crawling, rolls
over on his back and smiles up at Joe Shaye.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay, Joe…let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>super: new rochelle. new jersey 1964</strong>: A smoke filled
oak dining room packed with CLUB MEMBERS – HUNDREDS OF MIDDLE AGED WHITE
MEN wearing black suits and holding long cigars as they drink from
brandy glasses. FRANK ABAGNALE, 15, a BUCKLEY PRIVATE SCHOOL BLUE BLAZER
AND WHITE PANT with his mother, PAULA, 33, at a center table near themes
Paula is a stunning blonde dressed in diamonds and and since she’s the
only woman in the room – she’s getti t of attention. CLUB PRESIDENT JACK
WRIGHT takes rophone at the front of the stage.</p>
<p><strong>jack wright</strong>: The New Rochelle Rotary Club has a
history that goes back to 1859. In all those years, we have only
inducted a handful of deserving men as lifetime members, an honor that
has seen 187 names enshrined on the wall of honor. Tonight, we make it
188. So please stand, as I present my good friend, Frank William
Abagnale. Applause all around as FRANK ABAGNALE SR. steps up to the
MICROPHONE. He is handsome and impeccable groomed – wearing a black suit
and holding onto his plaque with two hands.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Two little mice fell in a bucket of
cream. The first mouse quickly gave up and drowned, but the second mouse
wouldn’t quit. He struggled so hard,</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>9 continued: 9</strong>: FRANK SR. that he eventually churned
that cream into butter – and crawled out. Gentleman, as of this moment,
I am that second mouse. Laughter from the men in the room as Frank
continues. FRANK SR. I stand here today humbled by the presence of Mayor
Allen, and our club President, Jack Wright. But most of all, I am
honored to see my loving wife, Paula, and my son, Frank Jr., sitting in
the front-row. I’m just a business man, a working stiff – but tonight
you have made me royalty. And for this, I am eternally grateful. The men
applaud as Frank Sr. smiles down at his wife and son, giving them a wink
as he raises the plaque in the air.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You’re a better dancer than your father,
Frankie. The girls don’t know what they’re in for.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Paula, show him the dance you were doing
when we met.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Who can remember?</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: The people in that little French Village
were so happy to see Americans, that they decided to put on a show for
us.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know the story, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: So they cram two hundred soldiers into
this tiny social hall, and the first person to walk on stage is your
mother. And she starts to dance… Paula steps away from Frank, and she
starts to dance a ballet, smiling as she tries to remember the steps.
FRANK SR. It had been months since we had even seen a woman, and here’s
this blonde angel on stage – and the men are literally holding their
breath. And I turned to my buddies, and I said..</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I will not lea France without her. Paula
spins around, accide1 49, ILLS HER GLASS OF WINE –</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Oh, shit, the rug! I b relieve I did that.
Frankie, run /get a towel… As Frank runs off, Paula drops to her knees
and scrubs the stain with the hem of her dress.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: This will never come out. She looks up at her
husband.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Whenever I dance for you, I get in
trouble.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Wake up, Frank… it’s eight-thirty. Frank
opens his eyes, stares at his father.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I overslept. Mom’s gonna kill me.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: It’s okay. You don’t have to go to school
today.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is it snowing?</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Do you own a black suit?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A black suit? Why?</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: We have a vermportant meeting in the
city.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Ma’am, open the door. Just open up,
please, it’s important. THE DOOR OPENS A CRACK AND DARCY, 40’s, low cut
blouse, a bagel in her hand, stares at Frank Sr.</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: we don’t open for half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: What’s your name, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: Darcy.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Darcy, that’s a pretty name. I’m in a bit
of fix – I need a suit for my kid. This is my son, Frank, he needs</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>13 continued: 13</strong>: FRANK SR. a black suit. There was
a death in the family, my father, eighty-five years old, a war hero,
there’s a funeral this afternoon – a military funeral – planes flying
overhead, twenty-one gun salute. Frank needs to borrow a suit for a
couple of hours.</p>
<p><strong>darcy</strong>: I’m sorry. We don’t loan suits, and we’re not
open. As she closes the door, Frank Sr. takes a small GOLD NECKLACE OUT
OF HIS POCKET, holds it up to the glass.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Is this yours, Darcy? I just found it in
the parking lot? Darcy stares at the necklace through the door.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Slide over. You’re gonna take me to Chase
Manhattan Bank. Just head up to seventy-second and Madison, pull up to
the front and park next to the fire hydrant. Frank looks back at his
father.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Dad…I don’t know how to drive.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: A little more gas – now slip it into
second. That’s good, more clutch, now pull into this lane here –
slowly!</p>
<p><strong>head out the window.</strong>: FRANK SR. Don’t honk at us you
son of a bitch – I’m teaching my kid to drive! You’re doing fine, Frank,
just pick a lane and slip it into third – about one- o’clock – push it
hard.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Okay. Stop grinning. When I get inside
you go back to the front seat and wait. Even if a cop comes and writes
you a ticket, you don’t move the car, understood?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Dad… is this really gonna help?</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: You know why the Yankees always win,
Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They have Mickey Mantle?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: No. It’s because the other teams can’t
stop staring at those damn pinstripes. Frank Sr. steps out from the
Cadillac, grabs his briefcase. FRANK SR. Watch this, Frank. The manager
of Chase Manhattan bank is about to open the door for your father. As
Frank Sr. casually walks toward the doors of Chase Manhattan, the
MANAGER rushes through the bank to open the doors for him.</p>
<p><strong>loan officer</strong>: You’ve owned stationery store for how
man rs?</p>
<p><strong>loan of</strong>: 1y loan money to people who hav resolved
business with the I.R.S..</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: That’s just a misunderstanding. I hired
the wrong guy to do my books, a mistake anyone could make. I wouldn’t
even consider that if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>loan officer</strong>: You want me to ignore the fact that
the government is demanding two years back taxes?</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: My store is a landmark in New Rochelle. I
have customers all over New Jersey.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>loan officer</strong>: Sir, you’re not a customer of Chase
Manhattan. We don’t know you. I’m sure you’re bank in New Rochelle…</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: My bank went out of business. Banks like
this put them out of business. Frank Sr. leans in, lowers his voice.
FRANK SR. Now I know I made a mistake, I admit that. But these people
want blood – they want my store – they’ve threatened to put me in jail.
This is America, right, I’m not a criminal. I’m a medal of honor winner,
a lifetime member of the New Rochelle Rotary Club. All I’m asking you to
do is help me beat these guys.</p>
<p><strong>lfrx officer</strong>: This is not estion of winning and
losing. It, question of risk. I’m very sort</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You’re the largest ion the world. Where’s the
fucking</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: The Impala is parked right over there.
Frank and his father glance toward an OLD, DENTED CHEVY IMPALA at the
back of the lot.</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: it was great doing business with you. THE
SALESMAN gets in the CADILLAC and drives it toward the front of the car
lot. Frank Sr. looks down at the CHECK in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Come on, Frank. Let’s go return the suit.
Debbie 7 ana - S</p>
<p><strong>j p</strong>: ank laughs with him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m making pancakes.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: We’re not gonna eat pancakes for dinner
on my son’s sixteenth birthday. Frank turns to his father. FRANK SR. Why
are you looking at me like that? You thought I forgot? Frank opens his
BRIEFCASE, takes out a CHECKBOOK FROM CHASE MANHATTAN BANK. He walks
over and hands it to Frank.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>22 continued: 22</strong>: FRANK SR. I opened a checking
account in your name. I put twenty-five dollars in the account so you
can buy whatever you want. Don’t tell you mother. Frank slowly opens the
CHECKBOOK, sees his name at the top of the first check.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But they turned down your loan?</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Yeah. They all turned me down.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So why open a bank account with them?</p>
<p><strong>frank sr..</strong>: Because one day you’ll want something
from these people – a house, a car – they have all the money. There’s a
hundred check ere, Frank, which means from i day on – you’re in</p>
<p>**o fll**: THE IMPALA pulls up to the f the local public High School.
Frank wears his BLUE WHITE PANTS as he gets out of the car and smiles r
mother. Paula wears an OLD FUR COAT over her pajamas.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: See that, it’s just a school. No different
than Buckley. Frank reaches through the window of the car, takes the
CIGARETTE out of his mother’s mouth.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You promised you were going to quit.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Frankie, you don’t have to wear the uniform
here. Why don’t you take the jacket off?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m used to it. Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is this Ms. Glasser’s sixth period French?
Some of the students laugh, most just turn back to their friends as
Frank nervously adjusts his tie. A GIRL in the front row stares at
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Are you the sub? Frank looks around for `�
teacher, then slowly starts to</p>
<p><strong>nod_</strong>: Frank walks toward the blac writes his name on
the board – MR. ABAGNALE. HE S ACK OF AN ERASER against the board to get
the students a n.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: Listen up, class. My name is Mr. Abagnale and
I’ll be your substitute today. Would somebody please tell me where you
left off in your text book?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Chapter seven.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Open your books to chapter eight, read
quietly to yourselves. The classroom door swings open, and a frail,
confused TEACHER walks in and motions to Frank.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Are you subbing for Roberta?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: They sent for me – they said they needed a
sub. I rushed over here from Dixon.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I always sub for Roberta.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I’ll never come to Monroe again. You tell
them not to call me! The WOMAN storms out, and Frank turns back to the
students.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I suggest you start reading people.</p>
<p><strong>vice-prin rown</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Abagnale, �1� is not a
question of your son’s attendance.</p>
<p><strong>principal evans</strong>: For the past week Frank has been
teaching Ms. Glasser’s French class.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: He what?</p>
<p><strong>principal evans</strong>: Your son has been pretending to be
a substitute teacher, lecturing the students, giving out homework.</p>
<p><strong>vice-principal brown</strong>: Ms. Glasser has been ill, and
there was some confusion with the real sub – we’re still not sure what
happened.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>principal evans</strong>: Your son held a teacher-parent
conference yesterday. He was planning a class field trip to a French
bread factory in Trenton. Do you see the problem we have? Frank Sr. and
Paula seem a bit confused.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: This is our fault, Principal Evans. Frank had
been at Buckley since he was a little boy. We had to take him out for
personal reasons, away from his friends – you know how kids are. He’s

small table in the middle of the bar. Frank looks uncomfortable as his
father lights a cigar.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe I should wait in the car.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Are you afraid of these men? Look at the

<p><strong>man #1</strong>: We’re not gonna tell you again. Step away
from the jukebox.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Why you bothering the kid? You got a

decision for himself and his family. Frank stares straight ahead, his
breathing forced as he stares at Judge Larkin. JUDGE LARKIN Okay, Frank,

the plastic, carefully slipping it off the wing so that the words PAN
AMERICAN WORLD AIRWAYS hang in mid-air.</p>

the check he has just made. The words stick to the paper, and he quickly
takes the check and places it in the middle of a hotel BIBLE. He sticks
the bible under his bed, the way a kid breaks in a new baseball
glove.</p>

<p><strong>in warm water.</strong>: Frank sits at a desk, pulls a CHECK
from the carriage of an electric typewriter. The check is perfectly
centered, the Pan Am logo straight, the lines and words looking thick
and heavy – as if they were printed. Frank takes the check and sets it
on the hotel bed, where FIVE HUNDRED FRESHLY MADE CHECKS are sitting in
neatly stacked piles.</p>
<p><strong>e’.</strong>: What can I do ou, Mr. Williams.</p>

one of the best.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What does it mean when one pilot says to
another pilot, “what kind of equipment are you on?”</p>
<p><strong>mulligan</strong>: He’s asking what kind of plane they’re

<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Okay, enough! I’m gonna be sick. I have to get
home and get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s only midnight.</p>

I’m gonna be short handed all week.</p>

<p><strong>frank</strong>: To be close to you.</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: We feed the checks through the micker machine,
and the magic eye reads the micker ink and then sorts the checks by
numbers.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What numbers?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: See the numbers on the bottom of the` checks.
Those are called routing numbers.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where do the checks get routed to?</p>
<p><strong>lucy</strong>: Well, I’m not exactly sure. Nobody ever asked
before.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: would you keep it down, please? The students
immediatel uiet down as Frank turns a page in his book – THE HISTO
BANKING IN AMERICA. He is reading a chapter called - - T E, NKS OF THE
U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE</p>
<p><strong>bans</strong>: WE SEE rows of desks, chairs, cou and cash
drawers – everything you could possibly find at a bank. The AUCTIONEER
stands in front of a room filled with BANKERS and BUSINESSMEN in dark
suits.</p>
<p><strong>auctioneer</strong>: Our next item up for bid is also
fromtheJersey National foreclosure. Thisisa micker encoder, a machine

Frank, dressed in a suit, smiles as he raises his paddle.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Five dollars. Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Happy birthday, Dad. Frank turns to face his
son, who is standing in front of a RED CADILLAC that still has the
sticker in the window. The two men stare at each other for a long BEAT,
and then embrace in the middle of the lot.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Jesus, look at you? My son the birdman.
That is some uniform, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I bought you a Cadillac. Frank motions to the
car, holds up the keys. K ission. She goes s an hour. It btj

<p><strong>frank s</strong>: She’s beautiful. Only� @�nna get myself
another white on r already ordered it. You keep that one, Frank,</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: maybe one day we’ll race to Atlantic City.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I went by the store today. Since when do you
close on a Friday?</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: I had to close the store for awhile. It’s
all about timing, Frank, the goddamn government knows that. They hit you
when you’re down, and I wasn’t gonna let them take it from me. So I just
shut the doors myself, called their bluff.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can get you money, whatever you need. We
can buy ten stores.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: No. It’s better this way. I’m laying’ low
for awhile, letting them have their fun. It’s just a stationery store –
sooner or later they’ll forget about me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Have you talked to Mom?</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: She’s so stubborn, your mother. But I
won’t let her go without a fight. I’ve been fighting for her since the
day we met.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Out of all those soldiers, you were the one
that took her home.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: That’s right. Two hundred men were
sitting in th’ little social hall watching he d ce. What was the name of
tha d I/ ..il lage? Montpelier.</p>
<p><strong>frank s</strong>: I didn’t speak a word six weeks later she
was A WOMAN PULLS UP IN AN OLD FORD AND HONKS FOR FRANK SR.. She smiles
and waves at him through the window, and he waves back. FRANK SR. Shit.
I have to go, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was hoping I could buy you a steak.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Jesus, tonight is no good. That’s my
friend, Darlene. She’s cooking me dinner for my birthday. She used to be
the pastry chef at Elaines. Why don’t you come home with us?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, I should probably get out to the airport.
I’m flying the red eye tonight.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Dad, I’m serious about what I said. I can get
you money –whatever you need.</p>
<p><strong>frank sr.</strong>: Just tell me where you’re going. I bet
it’s someplace warm.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah. Hawaii.</p>

tonight. The x t of us really are suckers.</p>

turning clockwise as an AGENT JOE SHAYE stands at the front of the room
addressing</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: John Doe 2172 is a paperhanger who
started on the East Coast. During the last few weeks 2172 has developed
a new form of check fraud, which I’m calling “the float”. Next slide.
The slide doesn’t change. JOE SHAYE Next slide, please.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent</strong>: The remote thing is broken. You’ll have
to do it by hand. Joe reaches in and turns the slide. JOE SHAYE What
he’s doing is opening checking accounts all over the country, then
changing the micker ink routing numbers on the bottom of those
checks.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: THE FACES OF THE FIVE FBI AGENTS, looking
bored as they all listen to Joe, having no idea what he’s talking about.
Some of the agents are yawning, while other are doodling at their desks.
JOE SHAYE This is a map of the 12 branches of the U.S. Federal Reserve.
The optical scanners at t bank read the numbers on the bott a check –
then ship the ch c}���f,? to the</p>
<p>**spec___**: Joe, for those of with bank fraud, wo telling us what
the h talking about?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: The East Coast branches are numbered
seven through twelve, the midwest four, five, and six…</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: You mean to say that those
numbers on the bottom of a check actually mean something?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Yes. And if you change a number one to a
number nine – a check cashed in New York won’t be sent to the East Coast
Reserve – but will be re- routed all the way to California. The bank
won’t know the check has bounced for two weeks, which means</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>82 continued: 82</strong>: JOE SHAYE this guy can stay in one
place – rob the same banks over and over. The AGENTS literally scratch
their heads, trying to follow.</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: And this is why you called for
an emergency briefing? Because of a couple of bounced checks? Laughter
from the other Agents as Joe tries to smile.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Sean, I was hoping to get-some back- up
on this.</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: You want my wife to help you?
She’s the one who balances the checkbook at home?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agents amdursky and</strong>: Hollywood. Fox sits in
the</p>
<p><strong>amdursϿ�</strong>: .I’m wearing a red nd high heels, running
through park and chasing these two Puerto Rican’s with a suitcase filled
with marijuana and I reach for my radio to call for back-up, but the
radio is stuck in my bra… Joe turns up the volume on the radio, keeps
his eyes on the road as he drives.</p>
<p><strong>amdursky</strong>: That’s a funny story. People always laugh
at that story.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Let me ask you something, Amdursky. if
you had so much fun working undercover, why did you transfer into bank
fraud?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>agent amdursky</strong>: I didn’t transfer. I was demoted.
Demoted is the wrong word. It was more like-punished. I screwed up in
the field.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: What about you, Mr. Fox? Did you fuck up
in the field and get punished?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: No. I’ve never worked in the field before. I
was in the L.A. public relations office, but we were shut down after the
riots.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: That’s just great. I ask for backup, they
drag the bottom of the Pacific.</p>
<p><strong>amdursky</strong>: Can I ask you mething, Joe? How come
you’re o erious all the time?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Does it bother you, Mr. Fox?</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: A little, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Would you guys like to hear me tell a
joke?</p>
<p><strong>agent amdursky</strong>: Yeah. We’d love to hear a joke from
you.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Knock Knock.</p>
<p><strong>agent amdursky</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Go fuck yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>motel owner</strong>: He’s been here two weeks, written lots
of checks. The one that bounced was for twenty dollars, and he took care
of it right away.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Nobody is goin to blame you. The bank
called u He’s probably not the man we’ oking for.</p>
<p><strong>er</strong>: I don’t want m-�Y u Comers harassed. He took
care of ’ o ’</p>
<p><strong>joe sha</strong>: Do you have any of th 1 written you?</p>
<p><strong>motel owner</strong>: He gave me one yesterday. The owner
takes a check out of the register, hands it to Joe. Joe stares at the
check for a BEAT, slowly starts to smile.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: I don’t believe it. You guys stay here,
watch the front.</p>
<p><strong>amdursky</strong>: Stay here? This guy’s a check forger, a
goddamn paperhanger. He doesn’t even carry a gun.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Why can’t we go with you, Joe?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Just be quiet and watch the front. And if
you’re good, I’ll take you both for ice cream when we’re finished.</p>
<p><strong>room 212</strong>: at the end of the second floor hallway,
the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN hanging off the door. Joe slowly makes his way
down the hall, passing a MAID wh ’s about to scream – until he shows her
his badge and vio y motions for her to hide inside a room. Joe creeps
along the walYh s gun straight out, his face covered in sweat. He free
Jow he hears a door creak, his breathing labored as the s of ROOM 212
slowly swings open and Frank walks into the ly u He wears a dark brown
suit and holds a black suitcase</p>
<p><strong>fi</strong>: Freeze! FBI! Don’t you move! Put your hands on
your head or I’ll shoot you! Frank slowly turns to face Joe. The two men
stare at each other for a BEAT_</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Relax, buddy, you’re late. My name is
Johnson, Secret Service. Our boy just tried to climb out the window – my
partner has him cuffed in the alley downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Secret Service? What are you talking
about? Keep your hands in the air.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You think the FBI are the only ones tracking
this guy. We’ve been following a paper trail for months, almost had him
in New York. Would you mind taking that gun out of my face, it makes me
nervous.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Let me see some identification.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Here. Take my whole wallet. Frank throws his
wallet to Joe, who catches it with his free hand, but doesn’t open
it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You want my gun, too? Come over here and take
my gun! Frank opens his jacket, but not wide enough for Joe to see that
he’s not armed.</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: Are you gonna e that weapon? We’re supposed a on
the same team. Joe hesitates, then slowly louW6Xs<code>J</code>3,. gun
and holsters it.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: I’m sorry. I got a little carried away. I
didn’t expect Secret Service on this.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Counterfeiting is our thing.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: I know. I know. I just wasn’t
expecting…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t worry about it. This is his typewriter.
I’m gonna go lock it in my trunk. Do me a favor and guard his room for a
minute. Frank starts moving toward the back stairwell.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And yell down to my partner in the alley –
tell him I’m on my way. Frank starts to walk down back stairwell. He
looks back at Joe, who stands at the front of room 212.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s your name, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Joe Shaye.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tough luck, Joe. Five minutes earlier and you
would have landed yourself a pretty good collar. Frank starts walking
down the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Wait. ,�4back to Joe. Frank stops, slowly
ty</p>
<p>****: Your wallet.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hang onto it for a pu`% , I trust you.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: I’ve cleared Amdursky and Fox
in this John Doe thing.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Thanks, Sean. It was my call all the
way.</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: Sometimes we all get a little
lost out there. No shame in being rusty. You want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Not really. I made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: Forget about it. There are
hundreds of John Doe’s out there.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Yeah, but I’m gonna get this one. The
worst thi a paperhanger can do is show is I saw him, I heard his voice –
r s nothing for him to hide beiin</p>
<p><strong>spect-aloa t wilkes</strong>: Just be careful, J u’ve got 12-
years in, nobody bo r u down on the first floor. You ally wrote the book
on bank d, and that’s good enough to make you F-4 { some day. There’s no
reason to put yourself in this type of position.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: what position is that?</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: The position of being
humiliated. Joe stares at Wilkes, slowly stands and heads for the door.
He’s about to leave when he turns and looks back at Wilkes.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Hey, Sean, you want to hear a joke?</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Knock knock.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Do you have any ketchup, Richard?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: It’s in the little bowl, Mr. Williams.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thanks. Here ya go. Keep the change. Frank
takes a crumpled fifty dollar bill out of his pocket, hands it to the
waiter.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Thank you very much, Mr. Williams. you want
some`5’v</p>
<p><strong>wait o</strong>: I would, but my sh’ over. I’m going home to

<p><strong>frank</strong>: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: is looking through a giant PRINT BOOK –
tediously searching for a match. Joe is alone in the fingerprint lab,
where a pathetic looking Christmas tree sits in the corner of the room.
The phone rings, and Joe quickly answers.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: This is Shaye. Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Johnson, Secret Service. Joe sits up at his
desk, grabs a pencil and paper.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: John Doe 2172?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve been trying to track you down for a
couple of hours. Did you know that most people in the FBI have no idea
who you are or what you do?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: What do you want? happened out li’n&gt;Zo
ngeles .</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Fuck you. Don’t yo ize to me. I’m the one
that’s Rn t you in jail.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Joe, do you always work on Christmas Eve? Joe
looks around the room before he answers.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: I volunteered, so that men with families
could go home early.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You were wearing a wedding ring in L.A.. I
thought maybe you had a family?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: No. I’ve never been married.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How come?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: You want to talk to me, let’s talk face
to face.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. I’m at the Waldorf Astoria in
Manhattan. Suite 3113. Joe starts to write this down, then suddenly
stops himself.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: You think you’re gonna get me again,
don’t you? You’d love for me to send twenty agents out on Christmas Eve
to barge into that hotel, break down doors so you can make a fool out of
me again?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Joe, I’m sorry if I made a fool out of
you.</p>
<p><strong>j shays</strong>: Goddamn it, o t you feel sorry for me. The
tru h knew it was you. Maybe I didn 1 {he trigger, but I knew.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: People only know wh r,y` iV tell them.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Then tell me something. How did you know
I wouldn’t look in the wallet?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The same reason the Yankees always win.
Nobody can keep their eyes off the pinstripes.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: The Yankees win because they have Mickey
Mantle.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I have to go. I’m catching a flight in two
hours. Merry Christmas, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: You didn’t call to apologize, did you
John Doe?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>7 frank</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: You’ve got no one else to call. Joe hangs
up the phone. He cups his hands to his face, then stares at a picture of
his WIFE AND DAUGHTER – which sits on the desk in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>new accounts manager</strong>: You account balance will be
three hundred dolls Mr. Williams. And these are y r emporary checks.</p>
<p><strong>new ac</strong>: Just take a deposit counter, then fill in ou
wish to the amounty</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t need to fill in my account
number?</p>
<p><strong>new accounts manager</strong>: At Nevada Savings and Loan, we
treat our customers by name instead of by number. Frank walks over and
stares at the deposit slips. He grabs A THICK STACK and shoves them into
his coat.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>95 continued: 95</strong>: When the deposit slips comes
through the other side, WE SEE a NINE DIGIT ACCOUNT NUMBER printed on
the bottom. Frank sits on the edge of his Las Vegas hotel room –
HUNDREDS OF</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: I’m calling it “The Switch.” Next slide.
The slide doesn’t change. JOE SHAYE</p>
<p>****: John Doe 2172 took two red and fifty deposit slips from Nevada
Savings and encoded his account number on the bottom of each one.</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: Wait a second, Joe. Those
slips don’t even have his name on them.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: The bank scanners read the micker ink
before they read pen ink. So even though those deposit slips are filled
out correctly, each person who made a deposit that day was actually
putting money into his account.</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: How much did he get?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -!</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Forty-six thousand, four hundred and’
twelve dollars. It was the second largest bank robbery in the history of
Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s the fuel consumption of a 707 in
flight?</p>
<p><strong>mulligan</strong>: Kid, I’m really not in the mood for this
today. That damn Skywayman is driving me crazy. There was another
article.</p>

weekl Frank stares down at the TIMES, h yes wide as he stares at the
headline: SKYWAYMAN VISITS WASHINGTON: ELUSIVE PHONY</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The Skywayman…</p>
<p><strong>mulligan</strong>: I keep telling them it’s not my problem.
He doesn’t fly on Pan Am planes – he flies on everybody else. The damn
paper is in love with this clown – they call him the James Bond of the
sky.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Did you say James Bond? Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>100 int_ - clothing store. - day 100</strong>: Frank is

<p><strong>frank</strong>: And you’re sure this is the suit?</p>
<p><strong>salesman</strong>: Positive. That’.s the same.one he wore in
the movie.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. I’ll take three.</p>

Fox, who is holding up TWO SETS OF</p>

it.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: The Skywayman. Holy shit, a perfect
match.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>amdursky</strong>: They describe The Skywayman as a
thirty-year-old – dark hair –six- feet – same fucking guy!</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: It doesn’t make any sense. A thirty-
year-old has to register for the draft, which means his prints have to
be here.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Maybe there’s a reason he didn’t register. He
could have a wooden leg for all we know. Maybe he was born in Peru and
he’s not an American</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Maybe he’s not thirty. Somebody call New
York, get a list of juvenile runaways from the NYPD. 102 EXT. - PAULA

<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: What he’s doing is a federal offense.</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: A young boy has to eat, has to have a place
to sleep. What do you want him to do? His father can’t help him. Paula
gets off the couch and grabs her purse.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -’</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I’m working part-time now at the Church. Just
tell me how much he owes and I’ll pay you back. Paula takes out her
CHECKBOOK.</p>

<p><strong>young doctor</strong>: These bottles need to be labeled when
you pick them up. Do you realize what would happen if they got mixed up
– do you understand how dangerous this is? Don’t stand there crying,
just nod your head and tell me you won’t do it again! Brenda nods her
head, quickly walks away from the Doctor and sits behind the RECEPTION
DESK. She buries her head and starts to write a letter, her body still
sobbing as Frank walks up to her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you okay? Brenda looks up at Frank, her
eyes and nose puffy from crying. She covers her mouth when she
talks.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: i He told me to ck up the blood, so I did.
He nev told me to label it. Brenda.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Brenda, I wouldn’t worr-out it. These Doctors
don’t know everything.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: It’s my first week. I think they’.re going
to fire me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. Nobody will fire you. I’ll bet you’re
good at your job.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: No, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll bet if I asked you to check the status
of my friend, Lance Applebaum, you could do that in a second. He hurt
his foot tonight. Brenda grabs a chart, starts to read it out loud.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - f</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Mr. Applebaum fractured his ankle. Doctor
Ashland is treating him in exam seven.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: See that. No problem. Brenda smiles, covering
her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: This is the emergency chart. See the blue
star, that means the patient has been diagnosed. After he’s treated, we
put a red circle here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How do you like those braces? Brenda looks
embarrassed as she stares at Frank.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: I guess they’,okay.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mine were bottoms. I h ’e still have my mouth

<p><strong>brenda</strong>: You have really nice teeth.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And you have a pretty smile. Brenda tries not
to smile, shaking her head and covering her face.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m serious. I think those braces look really
good on you. Brenda starts to blush as she continues to write her
letter.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What are you writing?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: A letter to Ringo.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What does it say?</p>

<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come on. What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: It says I love him. Pretty stupid, right.
Ringo Starr is never going to read my letter. Frank stares at Brenda,

Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles, Peace Corps volunteer in North
Africa. A pretty impressive resume, Doctor Connors? Why do you want to
work here?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I came to Atlanta to relax, to get away from
my practice for a year. But to be honest, I’m a little bored out at
River Bend.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>granger</strong>: Unfortunately, the only thing I need is an
emergency room supervisor for my midnight to eight shift, someone to
baby-sit six interns and thirty nurses. But I doubt you’d be interested
in that.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Would I get to pick my own nurses?</p>
<p><strong>doctor granger</strong>: Doctor Connors, here is your
temporary license, which allows you to practice medicine in the state of
Georgia for up to one year. And now let me be the first to say, welcome

the charts, the way Doctor’s scribble out prescriptions.</p>

Doctor Connors?</p>

stop. It’s so slippery.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It feels good, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Yes_ It feels incredible. Frank leans toward

Doctor Connors, come quick! I got a letter from Ringo Starr, he signed

cry.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: I had an abortion, and they said I wasn’t
their daughter anymore.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Then a few months ago they apologized and
said I was their daughter, but I couldn’t come home for awhile. I’m so

Frank.</p>

<p><strong>frank</strong>: What if I went to your parents, spoke to your
father and asked his permission to marry you?</p>

hours, hiding from the world, making a fool out of myself.</p>

you need to hide?</p>

doctor?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Before I went to medical school I passed the
bar in California. I practiced law for a year, then decided to try my
hand at pediatrics.</p>

the jackpot. Where did you go to law school?</p>

Assistant Prosecutors.</p>

<p><strong>brenda</strong>: Why are you saying this?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Brenda, I don’t want to lie anymore. I’m not

joking.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And I’m not a lawyer or a Harvard graduate or
a Lutheran. I ran away from home a year and a half ago when I was

Connors, right? You’re Frank Connors and you’re 28-years-old. Why would
you lie to me? Brenda turns to Frank, trying not to get upset.</p>

for him out there, and the last thing we want is for Frank to get hurt.

Harvard and Berkeley – I’m betting he can get a passport.</p>
<p><strong>amdursky</strong>: I already talked to the Miami police,
they’ve offered fifty uniformed cops in two shifts of twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: Joe, with our guys that’s almost a hundred men

<p><strong>a new passport</strong>: sits on a desk in the plush,
PENTHOUSE SUITE of the FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL. Frank stands at the window
looking out at a perfect Miami sunset as he talks on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is Frank Taylor, and I’m letting all the

<p><strong>frank</strong>: Debra Jo McMillian. DEBRA JO comes screaming
out from the sea of girls, hugging friends and crying as if she had just
won the Ms. America Pageant.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Heather Shack. HEATHER SHACK screams and
rushes into Debra Jo’s arms, the two girls screaming as Frank continues
to announce the winners.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>172 continued: 172</strong>: A STATION WAGON pulls up to the
front of the airport, and TWO COPS WATCH as EIGHT BEAUTIFUL COLLEGE
GIRLS walk out, all dressed as flight attendants, all holding luggage.
The cops never even glance at Frank, who stands in the middle of the
girls as they walk into the airport.</p>
<p><strong>173 int_ - miami international airport. - day 173</strong>:
Frank walks through the packed terminal surrounded by the EIGHT GIRLS,
all walking in stride, their hair and make-up perfect, every man in the
airport turning to stare. Frank and the girls walk past TWO FBI AGENTS,
who can’t help but smile at the girls – who in turn smile back.</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #1’</strong>: Did you see that blonde in front?</p>
<p><strong>fbi agent #2</strong>: I should’ve been a pilot.</p>
<p><strong>p.a. o</strong>: Will Mr. Joe Shaye k a white courtesy phone.
Mr. J e, please pick up a white courtes one. in the distance, JOE
watches as the eight girls walk toward him. He hesitates for a BEAT,
then walks to the back of the restaurant and finds a WHITE PHONE.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: This is Shaye.</p>
<p><strong>amdursky</strong>: Joe, you’re walkie talkie wasn’t working.
There’s a guy in a Pan Am uniform sitting in a white Cadillac in front

<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: That’s the charter terminal. Can you’ see
his face?</p>
<p><strong>amdursky</strong>: He’s got his Pilot’s cap on. I think it’s
him!</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Frank, get out of the car! Put your hands
on the hood! There’s no place to run, so just make it easy on yourself!
The car door opens, aMd YEAR-OLD kid gets out of the car, his hands
shaking s e cap falling off his head.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Don’t shoot me ! I ’ m§ ,s` ’ ,driver! A man
paid me a hundr ars to wear this uniform and p someone up at the
airport!</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: who are you picking up?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Joe Shaye. Joe lowers his gun, immediately
turns back toward theairport – watches as a BRITISH AIRWAYS JET takes
off and flies overhead, banking left and sailing out over the ocean.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: This just came for you, Sir. Who do you
know in Liverpool? Joe takes the envelope and slowly opens it. He pulls
out a stack of BLACK AND WHITE PHOTOGRAPHS, all of which show the EIGHT
COLLEGE GIRLS in various locations. There are shots of them on the
SPANISH STEPS IN ROME, at the EIFFEL TOWER, in front of BUCKINGHAM
PALACE, and in front of SCOTLAND YARD. A POSTCARD OF THE MONA LISA is
inside the envelope, with the words “WISH YOU WERE HERE” written across
the back.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Excuse me. Do u know where the Lavalier fa
lives?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hello. Do you speak English? Monique
nods.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My name is Frank. My mother is Paula
Lavalier. I was hoping to find my family. Monique takes Frank by the
hand, starts to smile.</p>
<p><strong>monique</strong>: I am Monique, your aunt. Monique hugs him,
kisses his cheeks.</p>
<p>****: Pappa! Paula’s boy is here! Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s very good wine. The family starts to
laugh at him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>marcel</strong>: The wine here is shit. This valley only
grows shit wine. It is used for stretching.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s stretching?</p>
<p><strong>monique</strong>: They send our ne by truck to the famous
vine r of Bordeaux and Burgundy, a d mix it with the good wine to r</p>
<p><strong>papp</strong>: The Americans thi only the best. But drinking
the shit fro Everyone laughs hysterically, and Frank joins in, the
family laughing together as they eat Sunday dinner.</p>
<p><strong>monique</strong>: Here. Your mother sent me this to me a few
months ago. Monique hands Frank a color photograph. Frank looks at the
picture, sees Paula standing with Jack Wright, holding a BABY in her
arms.</p>
<p><strong>monique</strong>: You look like your new sister.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>182 continued: 182</strong>: Frank stares at the picture,
then hands the picture back to Monique.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Everyone says that.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My name is Frank Wagner, and I’ll be teaching
the Summer session of American History, the same course I taught at Yale
last year. Why don’t you all open your books to chapter one, read
quietly to yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>monique</strong>: I have to pick Pappa up, his car is dead.
Come with me, Frank, you can see where he works? Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>monique</strong>: The family business.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I thought the family business was wine?</p>
<p><strong>monique</strong>: No. Paper.</p>
<p><strong>feet wide.</strong>: The giant machine fills warehouse. SIX
MEN work in the massive press room, t r afening THUMP of the machine
shaking the walls as it strugYle, it out 10 COLOR PAGES a minute. WE SEE
samples of their ning the walls – FRENCH</p>
<p><strong>close on frank</strong>: staring up at the giant PRINTIN his
body limp, h is face cold. Pappa Lavalier, shift and smoking, walks
toward him with a big smile.</p>
<p><strong>pappa</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve read books about these machines. But
I’ve never seen one.</p>
<p><strong>pappa</strong>: You want me to show you how it works?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>pappa</strong>: For color printing we set the back gears,
then put the plates in up- side-down, pour the ink in last,</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>pappa</strong>: never when it’s cold, then we roll the
cylinder brakes until they catch…</p>
<p><strong>close on frank</strong>: Lost in his own world, his mind
racing as he stares at every part of the machine – his eyes cold with
excitement and dread.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>amdursky</strong>: Joe…he cashed a check in Madrid.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Singapore. Australia. South America:’
Egypt. He’s also hit almost every major bank in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>fbi director marsh</strong>: How many checks?</p>
<p><strong>special agent wilkes</strong>: Thousands.</p>
<p><strong>fbi director marsh</strong>: Why wasn’t I called?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Nobody was called, Sir. The banks didn’t
know what was happening until last week. We think he’s been on the run
for five months.</p>
<p><strong>fbi director marsh</strong>: That’s impossible. Pan Am would
have called us. They didn’t c forging – and counterfeiting.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: He’s making real checks, Sir. These are
so perfect, Pan Am cashed them all.</p>
<p><strong>fbi director marsh</strong>: where is he?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: The last check was cashed in Paris a week
ago. He’ll stay there another week before he moves on. We have to go
now, Sir, today!</p>
<p><strong>fbi director marsh</strong>: Go where?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Paris.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>fbi director marsh</strong>: I’m sorry, Joe. If we couldn’t
catch’ him here, we’re not gonna catch him there.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: English. Do you speak English? I’m an
American FBI Agent. Hello? Shit! Joe slams down the phone, walks out’of
his office. JOE SHAYE Does anyone here speak French. I need someone who
speaks French!</p>
<p><strong>fox</strong>: He’s not an agent, Joe. He’s a waiter at the
restaurant around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>detective julien</strong>: Julien.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Who answered the phone? What’s his
name.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: His name is Detective Julien. He works in
the vice squad in Paris</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: That’s fine. Tell him I have a
proposition for him. Tell him the FBI has a proposition for him. Oliver
translates as Joe paces in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>oliver</strong>: Okay. What’s the proposition?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Ask him if he’d like to catch the
greatest bank robber the world has ever known.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: DETECTIVE JULIEN sitting al–h!ts ri�esk,
his expression suddenly changing as he glances aroun tation. He quickly
puts the crossword puzzle away and rips into the phone. Abagnale.</p>
<p><strong>french chauffeur</strong>: Where to, Mister Wagner?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Let’s go for a drive. I need some supplies.
The limo drives off. Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: When he gets to a new city he starts out
slow, hitting the banks on the outskirts of town. At first it’s small
checks in small banks that pose little or no threat. WE HEAR OLIVER’S
TRANSLATION behind Joe’s voice. JOE SHAYE Then he starts moving in,
circling the city like a mother hawk, picking off every little bank he
can find – slowly inching his way toward the center of the city.</p>
<p><strong>joe sha �1</strong>: There’s always one ba ’s bigger and
richer than all the ers. This is what he came for, and he’ll watch it
for days. He’ll know if they add a security-guard, or bring in a new
teller. And if he sees anything out of place, a new cleaning man, a
window shade that’s up instead of down, he’ll move on to the next one.
That’s the luxury of having the entire world as your mark.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: DETECTIVE JULIEN – standing in the middle
of Paris, looking down an endless row of massive banks.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: He’ll make his move right before lunch,
when everyone’s mind is on food and the lines are short. And he likes to
stand out – draw attention to himself.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: The more people see him, the more
invisible he becomes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is there something wrong? The bank teller is
shaking and staring at Frank. He slowly turns around, sees DETECTIVE
JULIEN standing behind him with his gun drawn.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p>****: Frank William Abagnale Jr., I sentence you to two years in
Papigone prison.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Joe, you have to let me call my father when
we land- I want to talk to him before he sees me on television.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Your father i ead, Frank. I’m sorry.
Frank turns to Joe. JOu i He committed su 0�.cL didn’t want to be the
one to t</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Suicide. No. That’s imps ’ibl</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: They found him inside his car, the motor
running, the garage door shut.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: who are they to think that? Who are they to
say something like that?!</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: It’s okay, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Joe, I’m gonna be sick! I have to use the
bathroom. Joe quickly takes off Frank’s handcuffs, and he jumps from his
seat and runs into the bathroom. Joe stands in the aisle with Amdursky
and Fox. Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>air france stewardess</strong>: You’ll have to take your
seat, Sir. We’re about to land. Joe knocks on the bathroom door.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Frank.</p>
<p>****: Frank! Come on;’’rMnk, open the door! Damn it…Frank! O</p>
<p><strong>later.</strong>: The plane has landed and stopped short on
the runway. WE SEE Frank crawling through a HATCH near the landing gear.
He drops fifteen feet to the ground below, starts running across the
runway.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>joe shays</strong>: Look under every seat, in every bathroom.
Check it all again, even the cockpit! As Joe starts moving through the
plane, something outside the window catches his eye.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: God in heaven…</p>
<p><strong>fi</strong>: Frank opens his eyes, sees his mother standing
at the window in a PRIEST’S PRIVATE OFFICE – a cigarette in her hand, a
row of collection plates on the desk in front of her…</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: You want a sip of water? Paula hands Frank
some water. He sits up and stares at his mother.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why didn’t you help him?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I did help him. Near the end I sent him
money, did you know that?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: I paid his rent. I was a kid when we met,
Frankie. I didn’t even speak English – I didn’t even know his last
name.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Then why did you marry him?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: Because he got me pregnant. I was seventeen,
and I was told I was going to marry him. They put me on a plane, and
said I was the luckiest girl in the world.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What about the baby?</p>
<p><strong>paula</strong>: The baby died an hour after it was born. The
Doctor’s knew as soon as he came out. Paula lights a fresh</p>
<p>****: It was a boy. T telling me I should hold him, didn’t want to. I
was scared he ie in my arms, so I said no. C imagine that, Frank, I
didn’t to hold my own son? Frank walks toward his mother and takes the
cigarette out of her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You promised. He doesn’t look back at her as
he walks out the door.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Taking into account your refusal to give back
the money, your history of bold escape and your complete lack of respect
for the uniform of the law, I have no choice but to sentence you to
eighteen years in Atlanta’s maximum security prison in Dixon county, and
recommend strongly that you be kept in an isolation cell for the
entirety of that sentence.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Merry Christmas, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: Frank doesn’t answer him. JOE SHAYE I got some
cigarettes here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t smoke. An awkward moment as Joe puts
the cigarettes on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: They say the first year inside is the
hardest.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You caught me. What do you want?</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe this was a bad idea.
I’ll go. As Joe starts to put the phone down.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re still wearing a wedding ring.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Yeah. The truth is, I’m divorced- I have
a daughter who’s nine.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>joe shp_ye</strong>: Vanessa. She lives in Chicago with her
mother. I don’t see her much. Frank stares at Joe for a BEAT. I’m on my
way el tJe airport. I’m tracking a paper ge who’s working his way
through Mi�t This guy is driving us crazy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Do you have any of the checks?</p>
<p><strong>fl</strong>: Joe hesitates, then opens his briefcase and
takes out a CHECK. He holds it against the glass.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: This is a counterfeit from Great Lakes
Savings and Loan. You can see that he’s using a…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s a teller at the bank.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s a teller.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Every bank uses hand stamps for the dates.
They get used over and over, so they’re always worn down, and the
numbers are always cracking – the sixes and nines go first. Look at the
date on that check – the ink is worn flat, the nines and sixes are
cracking – that’s the stamp of a teller, Joe. Looks like you got
yourself an inside job.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Eastern flight 794 you are clear to taxi on
runway_two-zero-four. That’s a big thank y, and goodbye, Newark. Ladies
and eman, we are leveled off here at’t five thousand feet. The sm gns
have been turned off for of you in a designated smoki My name is Captain
Frank Will so just sit back, relax, an the flight to Milan.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Joe, one of these days you should get
yourself a new jacket. What is that material? Frank touches Joe’s
jacket.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Cashmere.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That isn’t cashmere – look at the lining.
It’s some kind of polyester. You should see my tailor in New York.</p>
<p><strong>fbi director marsh</strong>: Can we do this, please?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Frank, this is FBI Director Marsh. He
wanted to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: At four in the morning? 1 1</p>
<p><strong>fbi director marsh</strong>: Mr. Abagnale, you’ve served five
years of an eighteen year sentence</p>
<p><strong>f k</strong>: That’s righ ve years, two months.</p>
<p><strong>tor marsh</strong>: I’d like you tcY o k at something for me,
tell me UO �%u think. Director Marsh takes an enveldi j of a briefcase,
slides it over to Frank. Frank opens t lope and pulls out a PAYROLL
CHECK. He holds the check is hand, never looks at it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s a fake.</p>
<p><strong>fbi director marsh</strong>: How do you know? You haven’t
looked at it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s no perforated edge, which means this
check was hand cut, not fed. The paper is double bonded, much too heavy
for a check. The ink is raised against my fingers instead of flat. Frank
brings the check to his nose, sniffs it.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>221 continued: 221</strong>: FRANK This doesn’t smell like
micker. It’s’ probably drafting ink, the kind you buy at a stationery
store. Joe and Director Marsh exchange a look.</p>
<p><strong>fbi director marsh</strong>: Frank, would you be interested
in working with the FBI’s fraud and counterfeiting unit?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I already have a job here. I deliver the
mail.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: No, Frank. We’d get you out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why are you saying this, Joe? You caught me,
isn’t that enough? Why can’t you lea ’ me alone?</p>
<p><strong>ector marsh</strong>: Frank, we ha wer to take you out of
prison. be placed in the custody of t where you’d serve the remainde ur
sentence as an employee of t al government.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Whose custody?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p><strong>super: march 29 1973</strong>: Frank wears a brand new black
suit as he walks into the massive FBI BUILDING. He approaches a SECURITY
GUARD.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m Frank Abagnale. I’m supposed to start
work here today.</p>
<p><strong>security guard</strong>: First floor, Mr. Abagnale.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane - 5</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Call me Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Morning, Joe. Frank turns and stares at a
door marked FRAUD. He casually walks inside.</p>
<p><strong>skyline.</strong>: Look at me,</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>: Frank walks through the door ny, run down
apartment. Joe Shaye stands at the door.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’d rather stay in a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: That’s not possible. Frank opens the
drapes and looks out at a POLICE STATION that sits across the street
from his apartment.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: One of the men gave me a check today. It was
for nine dollars.</p>
<p><strong>joe shays</strong>: That’s right. The FBI is paying you
prison wages. Joe turns to walk out the door.</p>
<p>****: Debbie Zane -</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tomorrow’s Christmas Eve. Would it be okay if
I went to work with you?</p>
<p><strong>joe shaye</strong>: Tomorrow night I’m flying to Chicago to
see my daughter. But I’ll be back at work on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Joe. . .what do I do until Monday?</p>
<p><strong>joe shp_ye</strong>: I can’t help you there, kid.</p>
<p><strong>the window of a costume shop.</strong>: There are several

me get your check. Joe grabs the check from Frank, puts some money on
the table. JOE SHAYE Did you know I was recruited by the FBI while I was
still in law school? The government said I was the best the country had
to offer, top of my class – and they chased me until I said yes.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sorry, Joe.</p>

even try and stop you, because I know you’ll be back on Monday.</p>

stares at Joe for a long BEAT.</p>

mouse gave up and drowned, but the second mouse struggled so hard he
churned that cream into butter and he crawled out.</p>
