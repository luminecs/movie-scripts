have wanted her to.</p>

never know about it. But that just isn’t possible now. I don’t know
what’s going to happen. But what can I say to you? Will ‘I’m sorry’ make
a difference? Will it ease the pain, the shame you must be feeling?
Forgive me…Please…</p>
<p><strong>ziat voice</strong>: Git!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Cold. Very cold. Can I get blanket?

<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m Billy Hayes… At least I used to be.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Looks like a cheap hotel.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Yeah… Only the room service is lousy. Come on,
let me show you the tennis courts.</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: Feeling all right?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah. That guy who beat me? I feel
stoned.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: ’Figgers.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: …He had a bald skull and…</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Hamidou. Chief of the Guards. Don’t fuck with
him. He almost killed an Italian dude couple months ago. Bad news. He
try anything with you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No… I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: With these fucking Turks, soon as the light
goes out… I keep one hand on their feet and their feet better not grow.
You’ll meet Max. He got raped something bad down in Section 13. That’s
the pits.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: The kids? Why are they…</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Little fuckers are thieves, rapists,
pickpockets, murderers, you name it - they do it. Don’t trust any of
’em…</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: …They tell Ziat everything. He’s the squeal
round here. Goes all over the prison. Sells watered- down tea, blankets,
hash, black money, nembutols –anything for a buck…</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: He was an informer on the outside but he tried
to screw the cops out of 60 kilos of opium. Watch him, he’s a fox.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Whatcha’ in for, smuggling? Rash?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: History, man, history. How much?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Two kilos.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: The airport. Trying to get on the plane for
the States.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Could be ten or fifteen. Maybe even
twenty.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Twenty months?</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Twenty fucking YEARS, man - YEARS! I figger
ten at the least.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Years?</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Yeah, what do you think this is, the good USA?
This is Turkey, man… It’s a fucking accident here if you’re innocent.
And anyway… …ain’t nobody who’s innocent.</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: halting but has a</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: …If you make bail, you’re free. You can get a
fake passport or sneak across the border to Greece. The Greeks hate the
Turks so much they never send you back. The Turks know it. They just
keep the bail. money.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Sure, keep dreaming and see where that gets
you… like Max, up in the head, you know… You gonna eat a lot more
fasoulia beans, Billy baby, ’fore you taste a hamburger ’gain cause you
broke the law man, and you got caught… And that… is history.</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: The law is sometimes wrong.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: The Law is never wrong, asshole. The Law
is!</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: New people sometimes get on his nerves.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>eric</strong>: He was caught steeling from a Mosque. That’s
heavy here. He got 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Thirty years?</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: Jimmy has more balls than brains. He didn’t
tell his parents he was in jail for a year and a half. He says he got
himself in and now he’s going to get himself out.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: Hashish. Ninety percent of the foreigners are
in for hashish.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What they give you?</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: Twelve years.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How much did you have?</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: A hundred grams.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s not fair!</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It’s all
“sula-bula” like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident
and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That doesn’t seem so bad.</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: But he was eating lunch a mile away when the
Turk smashed into killed himself.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He wasn’t even in the car?</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: Aslan, there…</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: Killed a guy. But his father’s a big gangster
on the docks. A “Kapidiye.” He’ll stay in… twelve months no more, and
get parole. In Turkey, murder is manly - “erkek”.</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.
And some money… Talk to Max. He’s been in the longest.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: Seven years…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Gastro. Stomach medicine. Has codeine in it…
Best can do</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: Lawyers?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah… there’s no straight lawyers in Turkey…
They’re all bent bent as hairpins…</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: His name?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: The lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>erich</strong>: Who got the Frenchman out?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh Yesil… Yesil’s his name but I…don’t know
anything… ’bout…Yesil…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Best way is get your ass out… any… way… you
can…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get the… midnight… express.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Billy!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dad…I’m…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: …Don’t worry about it. I can punch you in
the nose later. Right now we’ve got to get you out of here. You all
right?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah. How’s Mom?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Bad. She couldn’t make the trip. You know
Her boy… Susan told us before we got your letter. She’s fine; she’s
trying to get the money to come back and see you, but…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No, don’t let her! I’ll… How about Peg?
Robbie?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Same. None of the neighbors know. We told
them you were in a hospital in Europe. Oh… this is Stanley Davis. He’s
the American Consul here… And Necdit Yesil, the lawyer you wanted…</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Hello, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: I want you to know we’re going to do
everything, in our power to get you out as soon as possible. Believe
me.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>yesil</strong>: Vilyum, I am Necdit Yesil.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mr. Yesil.</p>
<p><strong>yesil</strong>: I know exactly what you feel but you must not
worry, we are acting immediately, we get the right court, the right
judge, I arrange everything - just right. And I think we get you bail.
If very bad, maybe twenty month sentence… But I think we get you
bail…</p>
<p><strong>yesil</strong>: You know I have lectured at the University of
Maryland in your country? Also University Michigan Very nice country. We
both go back.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: If I get bail, Mister Yesil, they say it’s
easy to cross the border into Greece?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Right! That’s what we’re shooting for.
Mister Davis and have been in contact with the State Department, but
right now relations with the Turks aren’t too good, Nixon’s upset the
hell out of them. Our best bet’s… right here.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dad… I’ll pay you back for all this, I
Promise.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Don’t worry about it. Right now money
doesn’t count. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Where’d you get that limp?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Nothing. Just twisted my ankle.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where you staying, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: The Hilton.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How do you like it? Istanbul?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Well, it’s an interesting place… Tell you
the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little
restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to
run to the damn toilet… You shoulda’ seen the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You mean you got toilets?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Yeah, with real toilet paper - and you don’t
have to use both sides.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: So now I’m eating at the Hilton every
night.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Why’d you do it, Billy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: For the money…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we
drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy.
Stupid.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dad get me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor voice</strong>: THE world is now looking at
Turkey. We are called the Heroin Supplier of the world. Stories about us
are in newspapers and on television every day all around the world. The
time has come, your Honor, to alter this image before we find ourselves
isolated and morally ostracized by the rest of the human race…</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor voice</strong>: …We must alter this image by
punishing only our own drug smugglers-but by handing out foreigners who
infest our culture with their depravity ungodly and behavior. We must
start now - by sentencing this American, Vilyum Hi-yes, to the maximum
sentence for smuggling, to be held up to the light of the world as an
example of Turkish justice and its intention to halt the drug trade once
and for all.. .I ask the Court therefore to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to
Life Imprisonment.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Thank you, Prosecutor. The Court will now
recess to consider its verdict.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’d the Prosecutor say?</p>
<p><strong>yesil</strong>: It’s not important, just technical things. We
make our case. You were very good, you spoke well. The Judge like you.
It look good. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Did you ask for bail?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: The Defendant has been found guilty by the
Court of the illegal possession of Hashish…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: …Therefore. this court sentences you, Vilyum
Hi-yes to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar Prison for a term of four years
and two months. This Case is now closed.</p>
<p><strong>yesilf</strong>: Four years, two months. It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Four years!</p>
<p><strong>yesil</strong>: We appeal it.</p>
<p><strong>yesil</strong>: You will see, he will have maybe one year
taken off this sentence for good behaviour. Remember, it is only for
possession; the prosecutor wanted life sentence for smuggling… To be
honest Mr. Hayes, it is a great victory!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: …With good time Billy it works out to about
3 years… then there’s the appeal. Yesil, Davis, they’re all working for
you We’re going to try to make a deal to get you transferred to a
Stateside prison. And Davis thinks there might be a political amnesty
any month…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Look - I know it sounds tough, Billy, but
we’re gonna get you out…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: …I promise you, but I don’t want you to get
stupid again. Pull anything. They can play with your sentence.</p>
<p><strong>fattier</strong>: I’m putting $500 in the bank for you.
Anything you need you write…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: There’s food, candy, writing paper, soap,
books… …cigarettes, soap, tooth-brush, there’s… Jesus! I been writing
insurance policies on people for thirty goddamn years… And now I gotta
see my own son…Jesus! Jesus! If I could be where you are Billy, I’d be
there… Goddamn Jesus! These bastards.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Oh Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You take good care of my boy, you hear, or
I’ll have your fucking head, you Turkish bastard!</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Dear Susan. 1970 has now passed into
1971. You can drift in here and never know you’re gone. You can fade so
far out and you don’t know where you are anymore or where anything else
is…</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: I find loneliness is a physical pain
which hurts all over; you can’t isolate it in one part of your body. I
so much need your softness, your strength. I have your letters. They
charge me, give me courage.News about amnesty and getting out - tangled,
complicated…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …I feel myself drifting more heavily into
smoking hashish. The haze helps the time pass. Also I do soap carvings.
Erich taught me. And I have been learning Turkish because it helps me to
deal with the guards and the prisoners. I’m trying hard to maintain some
sort of schedule to my life, but sometimes it seems like I’m just trying
in order to try…</p>
<p><strong>marks</strong>: inside we briefly glimpse a wad of
different-colored CURRENCIES stacked with rubber bands.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: … In the daytimes we sometimes play
volleyball against the big Turkish gangsters…</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: …To the Turks all foreigners are
“ayip” - unclean, dirty. We don’t shave our under-arms or around our
crotch…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: Even the yoga I sometimes do is “ayip”
- too suggestive…</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: And you’re never supposed to eat with
your left hand. You know why? Because that’s what they use to wipe their
asses with instead of toilet paper. And yet they hate pigs. There are no
pigs in Turkey. They’re considered dirty…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: So is homosexuality. That’s a big crime
here but most of them do it every chance they get. There are about a
thousand things that are “ayip”. But they’re really so hypocritical,
like children breaking the rules. For instance…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: …You can stab or shoot some body the
but not above the waist because that’s intent to kill. So everybody runs
around stabbing everyone else in the ass. That’s what they call ‘Turkish
revenge’. There’s also a lot of “Baksheesh” that’s a favorite Turkish
word for bribery…</p>
<p><strong>hamidou</strong>: Unfortunately my youngest son Arief is
having problems with his teeth; he needs braces, but dentists are so
expensive these days</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Poor kid… You know I have a friend, a very
good friend; he’s a dentist; maybe he could get you some braces at a…
reasonable price.</p>
<p><strong>hamidou</strong>: his hands, shaking</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Yes. Please! As a favour… I insist</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: Hamidou hints that he needs new braces
for one of his sons. Aslan of course has a friend who’s a dentist. They
bullshit for half an hour and Hamidou finally accepts the “Baksheesh” in
return…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: Dope and all kinds of shipments get
delivered to Aslan, who re- sells it through his runners. People like
Ziat. But one night, it backfired…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: There were thousands of yellow
nembutols. Aslan as usual had the privilege of going into the courtyard
before anybody else to pick up his stuff but…</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: …it happened to be a new guard that
day and he didn’t understand the system.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: No. It’s too early.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: Open the fucking Gate, you asshole! Do you
know who I am? You want to get in trouble!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Hey, I your mother! Get back to your
bunk.</p>
<p><strong>prison director</strong>: Aslan…be reasonable. Come down and
talk.</p>
<p><strong>aslan</strong>: You come up here and talk!</p>
<p><strong>prison director</strong>: Aslan… if you give up the gun, you
can keep the bullets</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: A week later Aslan had a new gun…</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: …I know all this must sound crazy to
you, but this place is crazy…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Everything is “sula-bula” which means “like
this, like that” - you never know what will happen. One day one of the
new kids was raped in the children’s kogus, so they picked out six of
the worst kids…</p>
<p><strong>children’s kogus</strong>: then he is bent over double by a
wooden bench; and TWO GUARDS sit on each end of the bench, holding him
down. A silence,</p>
<p><strong>sons</strong>: Puts them on ever so neatly and leads them off
as if on a Sunday stroll leaving the CRYING behind. On their backs, we
hear, placidly:</p>
<p><strong>hamidou</strong>: You see Mamur, Mamet - what happens when
you’re not a good boy.</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: Then there’s Ziat. The more I know of
him…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: …the more hate him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ten dollars for this shit? You greedy one-eyed
git.</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: NO! Is good! Me good shit.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No! You big shit!</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: Yeah! Efe big shit.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You asshole!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hikmet come here boy. Hikmet</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What is it with you man, what the hell is
it?</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: Cat, ah! Ayip!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You’re ayip!</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: Look, you don’t fuck with me, I don’t fuck
with you, right?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all
the time. You make crummy tea. You rip us off on the hash.</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay? We’ve
to live like brothers. We have to be in here together.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have,
you have nothing!</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: You ’Merican. You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: Was.. …seven years old. I was on street in
Suk. Buy. Sell. No family to take care. I learn.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Learn what?</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before
he fuck you. And you must fuck last.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s a great philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: You ’Merican. You don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Here Hikmet! Come down here boy! Hikmet…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sodding cat!</p>
<p><strong>yesil</strong>: The new American Ambassador here is following
your case very closely. He says there is progress. But there is another
route that is quite possible… …For the proper amount of money it is
possible I can convince certain officials to lose track of your papers
before the High Court in Ankara confirms the sentence of the Lower Court
in Istanbul… You would not exist; and you could be in Greece by the time
the Turkish courts discovered a stupid clerical mistake…But I have to
act before the official sentence is handed down, and for that I must pay
certain officials in advance…</p>
<p><strong>susan’s voice</strong>: …My dearest Billy. I know it is long
and it is hard for you, but your family and I are thinking about you all
the time. I am trying hard to make enough money nights to come and see
you. Your father says that lawyer Yesil wants another $2000. I know you
distrust him more and more, but your father wants to do everything he
can, and he is borrowing all he can on the mortgage of the house. Money
seems to be the only way out of there. Except of course the other
way…</p>
<p><strong>susan’s voice</strong>: …But I cannot say I am for it. Nor
are your parents. They consulted the priest, and he said to send you
money for that reason would be like sealing your death.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: The blueprints!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: To what?</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: The prison, man. There was this German cat an
architect in the hospital. He was helping the Turks build some shit
round the place. I laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Too bad you didn’t have a machine.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: There’s two ways out I figger - over the roof,
but that’s only one person, maybe two. The other way is Under.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Tunnel?</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: It’s already built! There’s a basement
substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that
there’s these old catacombs that the Christians built ’bout a thousand
fucking years ago to bury their dead. We’re sitting right on top of it –
here.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: The Kraut said there’s a whole bunch of hollow
sealed shafts sort of like dumbwaiters running along this wall; one of
them is right in there, right next to our shower. We get in there, he
says, we can get down into the catacombs. With three of us working….</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Gotta be here someplace. Thought I heard a
couple of dead Christians singing down there.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Stop shitting me, man!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: But how would you get into the shaft,
Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I suppose you knock three times and ask for
St. Peter.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Hey! I’m getting this together man and I don’t
need no fucking Gastro-head along on this trip! We go through the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We go through the wall?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We go through the wall.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: …The Kraut was right! I checked it out -
there’s no reinforced steel in those bath walls. They’re real soft from
underground seepage–</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: –the water like “’weeps” through the cement,
see. Twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. All we do is use
Gastrohead’s screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. Pull out 2, 3
stones, squeeze through, put ’em back, and get our ass down the shaft,
It’s a two night operation, maybe three.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And what do you do when you in the
catacombs?</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: The catacoombs? Whaddya want, a door? There’s
miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in
Istanbul.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You gotta be fucking crazy! You got stabbed in
the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you’re gonna end up in Section
13, that’s what - not the ’catacombs.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Section 13?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, for the criminally insane. I was there
once for two weeks and it ain’t an illusion. It’s awful. Namidou runs it
like a death camp, that’s where he spends most of his time…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’ t know. It’s someplace down in there….
..deep.. A big door…a wheel….</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Hey, you know what’s gonna get us out of here?
It’s not a map, Max. It’s our balls. You know what I mean… …I gotta get
laid man, I don’t know ’bout you guys, but if I don’t get it on soon,
I’m… I’m not gonna make it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Billy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: …The roof sounds better to me than digging
through a wall. Ziat’s round there all the time. But the roof….</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: The bullet percentage is awful high.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: If I get caught, Jimmy, I’m facing another
months. I’d be back up to 3 years, maybe more…</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Well fuck it! Choose your own death, babe, I’m
taking the roof out of here!</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Dear Susan. Poor Jimmy was caught and
beaten so badly he got a severe hernia and lost a testicle. He’s been in
the hospital for months having operations..</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: …In comparison my problems seem very
small. But two and a half years have now gone by, and in their own
fashion, the Turks are slowly draining my life away…</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: …I have problems with my stomach and
my leg muscles feel very weak. My gums seem to be shrinking and they
sometimes bleed when I massage them… They’ve pulled five of my
teeth…</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: …sometimes they null the wrong
one…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: …even my dreams don’t seem to work any
more. Because the outside doesn’t seem real any more. It’s not even a
fantasy…because there is no fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Even masturbation has become boring.
It teaches you, like the rest of prison life, to seal up your emotions,
and this is the greatest danger, this is what makes so many of the men
change into something monstrous…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: It is Erich who has taught me how it is
to be conscious, to channel and direct my energy. He has convinced me to
stop smoking hashish, he is the calmest man I have ever known. If you
don’t control your energy in here if can blow you apart like with Bell.
And you can’t waste it either. You have to weigh up every one of your
actions - for and against. Too little sex, too much sex either will
throw you off balance…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: …he has taught me about feelings, and
the need to express them. And he has taught me about love…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: …and what love really is, beyond its
physical forms.. .I think up to now I have only considered my own self,
never really another…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: …and now strange as it seems, Susan,
without having seen you in so long I feel myself more inside of you than
ever before. I feel your female mind. I sense you, touch you; …know you;
and find myself falling more and more… in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: A prison a monastery a cloister a cave,
Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister cave, Prison
monastery cloister cave, Prison monastery cloister…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Prison.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Dear Susan. Erich has been
transferred to a prison back in Sweden. He has profoundly affected my
life and though I am lonely without him I am calmer than ever…</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Though I only have 53 days left, I
feel I have never been so well adjusted to prison and to living as
now….</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Allah fuck Off!</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Asina Covaciml.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: …Poor Jimmy…</p>
<p><strong>billy voice</strong>: …Though his health is bad he still
won’t give up…</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: …He still talks of escape.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Sit down a moment, Billy. I’m afraid I have
some bad news for you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Something happen to Dad?… Mom?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: No… It looks like your going to have a new
court.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: The Prosecutor objected to your sentence for
possession; he wanted a smuggling conviction and the High Court in
Ankara reviewed it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: We’ve been notified that they rejected the
sentence…</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: There were 35 judges on the High Court.
Twenty eight of them voted for a life sentence.</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: The Lower Court in Istanbul will have to go
along with the decision. The Judge likes you and he’ll do the only thing
he can do under the law…. . He’ll reduce the sentence to thirty years…
We’re notified… Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT!</p>
<p><strong>davis</strong>: Billy! Please!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: …What is the crime? And what is the
punishment? The answer seems to vary from place to place, and from time
to time. What’s legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow cause some
society says it’s so; and what’s illegal yesterday all of a sudden gets
legal today because everybody’s doing it and you can’t throw everybody
in jail. Well I’m not saying this is right or wrong. It’s just the way
things are….</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: But I spent the last three and a half years
of my life in your prison and I think I paid for my error and if it’s
your decision today to sentence me to more years, I…</p>
<p><strong>i…</strong>: You know my lawyers told me ‘be cool Billy don’t
get upset, don’t get angry, if you’re good I can maybe get a pardon, an
amnesty, an appeal, this that and the other thing.’ Well that’s been
going down now for 35 years…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: And I’ve been playing it cool and I’ve been
good and now I’m damn tired of being good cause you people gave me the
belief that I had 53 days left. You hung 53 days in front of my eyes and
then you took those 53 days away, and Mister Prosecutor! I just wish you
could…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: … stand right here where I’m standing and
feel what that… …feels like, cause then you’d know something you don’t
know you’d know what means, Mister Prosecutor and you’d know the concept
of a society is based on the quality of its mercy means, of its sense of
fair play, its sense of justice… but I guess that’s just like asking a
bear to shit in a toilet…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: For a nation of pigs, it’s funny you don’t
eat them. Fuck it, give me the sentence. Jesus forgave the bastards, but
I can’t. I hate you. Nation. I hate your I hate your people. And I fuck
your sons and daughters!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: …cause you’re all pigs.</p>
<p><strong>translator</strong>: Would Your honor like me to
translate?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: That won’t be necessary</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: My hands are tied by Ankara!</p>
<p><strong>translator</strong>: My hands are tied by Ankara!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: … to be imprisoned at Sagamilcar for a term
no less than thirty years…Getchmis olsun</p>
<p><strong>translator</strong>: “I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes, to
be imprisoned at Sagamilcar for a term no less than years…”Getchmis
Olsun”</p>
<p><strong>translator</strong>: “May it pass quickly.”</p>
<p><strong>song over</strong>: “Mmmmm… got the blues babe, Got those old
Istanbul blues, Said Yeah, I got the blues babe Got those old Istanbul
blues… Thirty years in Turkey, babe, Ain’t got nothing left to
lose…”</p>
<p><strong>song over</strong>: “Busted at the border Two keys in my
shoes Said I was busted at the border with two keys in my shoes An they
gave me thirty years, babe To learn the old Istanbul blues…”</p>
<p><strong>song over</strong>: “I said Lord now save me Please save me
from this pain”</p>
<p><strong>song over</strong>: “I said Lord come and save me, Come save
me from this pain Come set me free sweet Jesus…”</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: Hey knock off that shit music…</p>
<p><strong>turk</strong>: …We’re playing the sas.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Omina koyden your sas!</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: …And besides that I fuck Allah and I fuck your
Muslim mother too…</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: You got that, shit face? Asina…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Cut it! No more fights.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’re getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s voice</strong>: Dear Susan. It’s taken me a long time
to find out that it’s got to stop somewhere. I’ve learned painfully not
to trust the Turks, the courts, the lawyers, the Consul, the United
States Government, and not even my loving parents. There is only one way
out of here.. The Midnight Express.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We’re undermining the other stones!</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: We gotta take a chance and do that one next -
Then pull out this one - Just jiggle it, scratch it out, loose nit up,
it’s soft real soft!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s there!</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Listen!</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: I told you, I told you you cock- suckers! You
didn’t believe me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Fuck me! You beautiful mother, you!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay!</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: Work, work, work, that’s all do</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t hear you bitch about the money.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Want me to take over?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You want to split your hernia again?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get off our tits!</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. No time. Put ’em back.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We go early. Any fuck-ups we should be back
here and have the stones in by dawn.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You got your stuff?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Haps, railroad, bus timetables?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay. Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: How’s your hernia?</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Don’t make me laugh.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: What do you mean, you forgot, he’ll have
my ass!</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: Well I can’t do two things at once, you
were supposed to be here at nine o’clock!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Anybody bitten?</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Nah, just covered with batshit!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: They went out over there: must be some kind
of exit.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Let’s go back the other way.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: The fuck are we?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Two thirty.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Shit! Shit! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s a dead end. The Turks musta’ sealed it
up.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: What the fuck we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We go back.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What? You gotta be joking.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We go back, seal it up again, and come in
tomorrow night - every night ’till we get out of here. There’s gotta be
a way. Those bats got out someplace. Now let’s go. Doubletime!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You gotta have a lot of balls for this</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Count me out. Who ever heard of anybody
sneaking back into a fucking jail?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah, what if got caught?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey Max, don’t make the dummy laugh.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who’s laughing? I mean I find this terribly
depressing… Can you see old Hamidou’s face when he tries to figure this
one out?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’ll tell him we were checking out our
escape route. We wanted to be completely sure before we tried it.</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Billy, wake up! They found it!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>bell</strong>: Ziat!</p>
<p><strong>hamidou</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>hamidou</strong>: No do! No do! I tell you I see you again..
Finish!</p>
<p><strong>hamidou</strong>: Take him!</p>
<p><strong>bell.</strong>: No! Oh no! No…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You bastard! This time I’m gonna kick your
fucking brains all over this kitchen!</p>
<p><strong>ziat</strong>: Fine. Good. Man to man. We fight now. And when
finish I bring Hamidou and he kick you fuckinq ass.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Max! Cool it! Ziat’s just doing his job.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bell’s gonna talk. They got to find out. Man,
we gotta out.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Goddamn Gastro’s killing me. Making me blind.
Hey Billy!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I got some acid man. Maybe we can drop some on
the guards huh? In their tea or something.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to
me. That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him. When he’s
Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Then we’re outside the kogus. Then what?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: After we’re outside the kogus?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh we… we…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Max… Your BILLY shirt’s on fire…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh shit! Oh Christ!</p>

boy. I have been here very long time. They will never let me go.</p>

<p><strong>ahmet</strong>: No, they’ll never let you go. They tell you
they let you go but you stay. You never go from here.</p>
<p><strong>ahmet</strong>: You see we all come from a factory. Sometimes
the factory makes bad machines that don’t work. They put them here. The
bad machines don’t know they’re bad machines, but the people at the
factory know. They know one of the machines that doesn’t work…</p>

us? The bad machine doesn’t know he’s a bad machine. You still don’t
believe it? You still don’t believe you’re a bad machine?</p>
<p><strong>ahmet</strong>: To know oneself is to know God, my friend.
The factory knows. That’s why they put you here. You’ll see. You’ll find
