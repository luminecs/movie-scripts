<p><strong>jones</strong>: Burritos…Enchiladas…</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Oh, gag, man, how can you eat that
stuff?…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: I can’t wait for fresh vegetables…</p>
<p><strong>beck’s voice/ radio</strong>: Okay, cut the chatter. You’re
not out of here, yet. Who’s the hook? Seven?…You got a hook on container
22?</p>
<p><strong>sixpack’s voice/ radio</strong>: The man’s asking if you’re
hooked on 22, you dumb shit.</p>
<p><strong>jones’ voice/ radio</strong>: Watch your mouth, Sixpack.
Hello, Shack, Seven, here. I ain’t the hook, over.</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Six to Shack. I’m the hook.</p>
<p><strong>beck’s voice/ radio</strong>: Okay, Six, let’s wrap this
container and call it a day.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack’s voice</strong>: Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit or
something? We’re all waiting on you, honey.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Keep your pants on Sixpack. I promise you’ll
be inside before “Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood” comes on.</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Six to Shack…Hook’s on. Ready to
winch.</p>
<p><strong>beck/ radio</strong>: Ok, that’s it. Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: When it’s time to relax…. One thing stands
clear…</p>
<p><strong>jones’ voice</strong>: Mil-ler’s tastes too good to hurry
through…</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: …beer after beer…</p>
<p><strong>jones/ radio</strong>: Hey, Hazy, I’m not that bad, man.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Jonesy! I’m losing compression… I’m going
to blow my suit, man! Beck! Doc! Help me!…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Give me a readout, DeJesus.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Ahhhh!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: DeJesus! A readout!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: He don’t need a readout, man, he needs
help!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Stay calm!</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Calm!? Where’s Doc?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: The internal monitors read normal.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Where’s Doc?!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: He’s not at his station.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Oh, mother of Jesus, forgive me of my–</p>
<p><strong>beck’s voice</strong>: Get him into the Shack.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: I’m telling you, it’s the suits!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Fuck the suits, it’s the people monitoring
them. It Doc had been there like he’s supposed to it never would’ve
happened!</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: And just what the fuck would he have done
to stop it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: I know all about implosion, man.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Yeah, I bet you do. I bet you were
imploding in your pants. Jonesy! Doc!…Help me! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Knock it off, Sixpack! I know it’s been a long
month for every- one, but we can’t let something like this tear us
apart…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Fuck the suits man…this place is going to
kill us first.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: There it is again… Two more days. I tell
myself ‘you can make it two more days–’</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: What’s the weather like up top?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Clear for pickup.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Let’s hope it holds.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Then what? Huh? Then what? You folks think
going up top’s the answer to all your problems. Well, it ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Give us a break, Cobb…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: A break? You folks don’t need a break, you
need psychiatrists. ’Know what you’d be doing if you were up there,
right now?</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Eating pussy and drinking brew…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Eating pussy my ass. What about lines at the
bank: What about getting stuck in traffic?</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Wherever I can find it.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Bullshit! I’ll tell you what you’d be doing!
You’d be watching news on TV that’s so fucking bad it makes you
nauseous. So you go out and get in your car to get some fresh air and
after you’ve been driving for five minutes you realize the air’s so damn
dirty you don’t dare breath it! That’s what you’ve got to look forward
to…</p>
<p><strong>cobb’s voice</strong>: …And if you’re lucky enough to make it
back home to your house that looks the fucking same as everyone else’s,
you’ll find your wife’s just as fat as she was when you left and the
only reason your kids ain’t strung out on the drugs they were using when
you left is that they’ve found some new drugs which fuck ’em up even
more!… You people just don’t appreciate how good you’ve got down
here…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Doc eat already?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: The good doctor hasn’t showed yet.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: How do you feel, DeJesus?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Better let the Doc take a look at you, after
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Yeah, since he was busy earlier when you
needed him.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Cut it, Sixpack.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: ’Makes me feel better already…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I’ve been looking at the duty roster…at the
shack hours outstanding…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Uh, oh…I see where this is going…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: …all of you owe time and I thought tonight
would be a good time to—</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: No way, Mister Beck! No fucking way! We just
did a full shift, you can’t call Shack duty on top of a full shift. It’s
a contract violation!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Whooo! Right on, Cobb! Let’s hear it for our
shop Steward!</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Hear that Becky, er, Mr. Beck? Company got
to abide by the rules.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I know all about the contract. The point is
you can follow the goddamn contract to the letter and pull your shack
duty tomorrow…or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down
day. It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: You giving us a day off?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What about our quota?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: You’re only twenty-five tons off quota.
Barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last
day. It’s just a day off. You don’t have to take it, I just thought it
might help.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Count me in.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Cobb, Jones, I want you to do something about
that damn rattle in the air system… Bowman and Sixpack…living
quarters…</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Williams…get DeJesus’ suit on the “sick rack”
and do a diagnostics. Any other suit problems she should know about?</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: My pocket. Check my pocket, will ya,
honey?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Your pocket?</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: The latch is screwed up. Or the hinge.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You did good…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Today…with DeJesus. That was smart thinking
to get him inside…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: There probably wasn’t anything wrong with his
suit…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Still…you did the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I must have dozed off.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Are you planning on working tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Well, I’ll be on the golf course in the
morning. Then, if I don’t have any babies to deliver–</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: We almost had an accident today. DeJesus’
suit…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You got something to say to me, son?…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I…I think it’s important to have the second
officer on deck.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’ll keep it to nine holes in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Christ…what a pair…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: What was that? What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: I said, “What a pair” the boy wonder Shack
Boss and his drunken doctor buddy make… Why? What did ya think I
said?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Listen to it for Christsake.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Ah, it’s just old, like me. You don’t see the
Doc opening me up every time I get a new creak in my joints…I say, as
long as it’s recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. But,
’long as we’re here…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Two hundred and fifty-two tons of Magnesium
and 15 tons of Sodium.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Sounds like a good week, Beck. In fact…I put
your folder in front of the Vice President of District Operations last
night…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Thank you, Martin.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t thank me, yet, but it is important to
know where you’re going and who your friends are… ’Know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Probably a short.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Okay, watch this..</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: So that’s all you do?…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Shhhh…don’t tell no one. Job security.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Nothing wrong with this…</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Fuck you, Sixpack! You think you’re
funny? You’re not funny!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: This is Beck. Is there a problem,
Williams?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: A little problem, sir…but I’ve got a handle
on it now.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Made your million, yet?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How’s TransOcean doing?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: You got money in this tub?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I signed-up for the stock option.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Hey, man, you know that in Switzerland–and
this country’s the size of East L.A., okay?–they speak 54 different
dialects? Fifty-four!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Who cares?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: I do, man. That’s a beautiful place. When I
get out of here I’m going there. Find a nice little snow covered chalet,
warm little woman, crackling fire–</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Hey, Cobb…Man, why don’t you take off your
shirt and pants, man? You should do that wearing what you’re going to
wear at the beach.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: This is what I wear at the beach,
goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: “Major development in South Indian Ocean set
for fall of 2010…” That sounds interesting, but they’re too tied to
their holdings. Remember a year ago when they lost that tanker?… The
bottom fell out of their stock and I lost a bloody fortune. That’s when
I decided to diversify.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You take your money, too seriously, Bo.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: You’re damn right I do. Five years down here
and I’ll pull in more than 15 topside. I’m not down here for the fun,
I’ll tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack’s voice</strong>: “Fun?” Somebody talking fun?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Get out of here, Sixpack.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: I got a date with an angel…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hey, Bo…when’re you going to be off that
thing? I want to find out tonight’s NBA scores and check the
weather.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: The weather’s good, I already checked, but
I’ll be off in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hey, Jonesy, who’s the best power forward in
the NBA…Jameson?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Jameson? Who’re you trying to con?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hey, Hazy! We got a day off tomorrow,
Kemosabi! Let’s get shit-faced!</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: No, man, Cobb is a Chivas drinker, from way
back. Ain’t that right Cobbie?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You guys are crazy. What the hell you play
that stupid game for?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: What game, Cobb?…I’m on my way to
Nirvana…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re on your way somewhere all right…the
looney bin.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: I’m on the way to the looney bin? Hey, man,
I’m not the dude sun bathing in his clothes.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Oh, Darlin’…come sit on my face…</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: That bitch!</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Bitch! Look what you did!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sorry, darling…Just thought a little humor
would loosen us all up…you know?…</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: You think you’re so funny? Wait till you
taste this!</p>
<p><strong>beck’s voice</strong>: That’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Look at my foot, sir! This bitch put a
goddamn sea monster in my bunk!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: How do you know it was Williams?</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Huh? I…uh…uh…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: All right, Sixpack, you and Williams are gonna
pull water duty tomorrow–</p>
<p><strong>sixpack and willie</strong>: Bullshit! What?! She…He…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: At ease! You both have a half day…Anymore shit
and its a full one.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Oooooh. Damn! Not so loud. Turn down the
music.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What music? There ain’t no music.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Oooooh.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You know it’s really crazy to pretend to be
drunk, but it’s fucking insane to pretend to have a hangover.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Your “hangovers” made you miss the Sixpack
Good Morning Show. “No goddamn boy is going to make me go out on a down
day.”</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yeah? How’d the kid hold up?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Pretty good. He sent them out videotaping
outcrop.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Charge set?</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Charge set. Backing off. C’mon Rover
let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I need more light on that, Four.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Roger… More light, Sixpack…</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Boo!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You shit….</p>
<p><strong>beck’s voice</strong>: What’s going on, Four? What’s
happening?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: We’re fine, Shack. His lights malfunctioned
for a minute. How’s this?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: That’s great. Now let’s move 35 degrees
southwest.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You screw around like that again and–</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: What’s wrong, did you miss me?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Hardly.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Don’t worry, darlin, I’m…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What’s wrong?! What happened?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sixpack?! Sixpack…</p>
<p><strong>beck’s voice</strong>: Willie? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: He’s gone. I think he’s fallen. I’m going
down after him.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: That’s it Jonesy…Sweat it out, man…Got to
get the poison out of our blood.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Sixpack is lost.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Weren’t they tied? They’re supposed to be
tied.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: How far away is she?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Two hundred meters.</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Four to Shack…nearing the bottom.
Look at this…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: My God, look at the size of those tubers….</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Nine, ten feet high…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: If he had his blinkers on–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: It wouldn’t make any difference in there…He
could be two feet away and on fire and she’d still not see him!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sixpack?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Why can’t we pick up his signal?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Maybe he got eaten?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: What would be dumb enough to eat
Sixpack?</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Four to Shack…you picking this
up?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Affirmative…Widening picture.</p>
<p><strong>close on the monitor</strong>: The picture zooms in on the
corner and Willie’s added light suddenly brings the letter “M” into
focus.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What the?…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Russian.</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: I’m going inside.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What’s your air reading?</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Twenty minutes…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Twenty minutes!…Who had tank duty?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Who else…Sixpack.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: The man is unbelievable… I say, leave him in
there.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: What about his suit? That’s a million five
the company’s got to replace. They’ll make somebody go get it.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Willie, we’re giving you five minutes…after
that we’re coming in.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Sixpack?…Answer me.</p>
<p><strong>what she sees</strong>: The ship’s infirmary. Broken glass,
stainless steel…the light does strange things, reflecting,
sparkling…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: The infirmary…</p>
<p><strong>beck’s voice</strong>: Three minutes…</p>
<p><strong>beck’s voice</strong>: One minute.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: I’m rich, honey. Rich!</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: It’s all mine if I’m on report. Otherwise
you gotta take me off report before you look at any more… Ain’t that
right, Cobbie?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You’re on your own, Sixpack, you fucked up
everybody’s day off…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Personal effects…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Timex…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Russian money…Don’t look like much.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Yeah, I’d say you can retire with all this
loot.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: “Debbie Does Dallas”… Hell, it’s in Russian.
I can’t read it…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: May I see it?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Vodka.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What assholes, they lock booze in the
safe.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Probably confiscated. No booze on board,
same as us.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Stolichnaya.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: You read Russian?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Russian, French, Italian, Spanish, Greek,
German, a little Hindu, some Serbo Croat and a smattering of
Swahili…standard pre-med background…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: …and a Russian grandmother…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I want all this stuff impounded in the supply
safe.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You mind if I take a look at this?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: You got ’em!</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: What good’s the kid’s med records
anyway!</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Watch and learn, amigo…</p>
<p><strong>doc’s voice</strong>: Another party last night. More Vodka.
The infirmary is filled as it is. I confiscate what I can, but I know
the Government Observers have more…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What do you want me to say? That it all sounds
mysterious?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: These observers were doing something. A test…I
think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What mistakes? Look, I think it’s no big deal
but if you want to find out why this ship sank have Maritime run a
check.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I did. They have no record of the wreck. The
Marshal Goloviev is now on a tour in the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: It’s not the phone number…</p>
<p><strong>bowman’s voice</strong>: Okay, try the social security
number…</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Okay, give it to me…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Two…twelve…ninety-six.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: You guys are so full of shit… Who’s going
to use their birthday…</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Like I said, that bottle’s mine!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I want your permission to check that vodka.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: This is a mining shack, not a lab, Doc. If
there’s something strange with the vodka it’s safe till we get back.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Beck’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Something wrong, Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Uh..Excuse me sir, it’s the air recirculating
system, sir…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What’s wrong with it?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: …I’d really have to show it to you.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: All right…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Cute, DeJesus…Specimen cups?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Aw, loosen up, Bowman… Hey, Willie, I got one
served up for you.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No, thanks. I’ve got my blood tests in three
days.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: That’s all you do is exercise. You got to
learn to live a little.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: After my astronaut training physical, then
I’ll tie one on.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Forget space cadet, I’ll drink hers.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Hey what happens it he goes back and finds the
bottle missing?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: He won’t…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Looks concerned.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Shakes her head, something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Can’t get the taste off his tongue.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Seems totally satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: who has held the liquid in his mouth
savoring it, suddenly spits the vodka out.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Shit! It’s water!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Beck switched it!</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Can you beat that? The sonof- abitch
doesn’t trust us!</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: That little turd. If I ever get the chance
I’ll fix his ass.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Didn’t I ever tell you vodka was my favorite
drink?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: That was a loud one wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: After a month of it you’d think I’d be used
to it.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: How’s astronaut training?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Why? You going to give me hard time like the
others?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: No. I’m just being friendly.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Good…It’s going good.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Whatever made you want to do a tour down
here?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I need electrical field experience on my
resume. Everything helps… Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Everybody in corporate training serves a tour
on the line. Sup- posed to hone leadership skills or something.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Has it helped?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I guess there’s not a lot of adventure in
the Control Room.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: You think I should hang around more with the
crew?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, I always heard you don’t “learn”
leadership, you earn it. How did you know they’d get into the vodka?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I guess I figured if I was in their shoes
that’s what I would’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Maybe you’re more one of us than you
think…sir.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Puuleeeeze…</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Hey, Sixpack…Rise and shine amigo…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Let’s see your tongue.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Pretty good imitation of a hangover and I ought
to know.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Well, it ain’t! It feels a thousand times
worse.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: I…I dunno. I just feel… wrong.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Take off your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>what he sees</strong>: SIXPACK’S TORSO There are strange
black areas, each of them an inch in diameter.</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Shit, Doc…I didn’t know I had them.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: …as long as you know it’s not in your
contract.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, suit yourself, then…its your decision…
Ha ha…a little joke…suit yourself…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: How’s the weather for pickup tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Bad as he is there’s no way we can make our
quota with- out his sad self out there. You just can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: He’s tanking on us…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No…he’s really sick. I heard him last night.
The company will take that into consideration…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Honey, the company don’t give a flying fuck
about “whys,” they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we
miss our quota they only got to pay us half-pay for the entire
month.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: ’Cocksucker’s tanking on us…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: No, he’s really sick…He won’t be going out
today.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: There goes our quota…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Thirty days, right down the toilet…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Excuse me, sir…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Is this a contract violation, Mr. Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: No sir…I just wanted to know if you needed a
hand?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>sixpack</strong>: Please, Doc…I’m cold…I hurt…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m just going to take a tiny piece of skin to
look at under the microscope…Afterwards I’ll give you a sedative.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Okay, number 23’s full.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Let’s get it out of here and bring in a new
one.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yes sir…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Hook’s on 24…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Let’s have her…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No kidding? “A virus of unknown origin.” Come
on and tell me something I don’t know… like what’s going on…</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Good work out there, Mr. Becky.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Dead? This morning you said he had some skin
disorder.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He did.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Well, how the hell does a skin rash kill you
in eight hours?!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Here. Put this on. You examine him.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I’m not a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: For this…you don’t need to be.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: The mask is because you think it might
be…catching?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I don’t know. I’ve been back and forth with
Narragansett Naval all day, consulting with the best people in maritime
medicine, the best people in viruses…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: And they didn’t believe the symptoms I
described…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Why Sixpack?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It could be a million things, something in the
air, food…. But he went on that ship and so did Williams… I want to
examine the crew.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Yeah…right…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’ve reported the death to the company.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: “Routine,” my ass! Ain’t nothin’ “routine”
about no physical check- up 10,000 feet down…especially when we’re
getting picked up the next day!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: He didn’t say it was a “routine check-up,” he
said it was a “routine precaution.”</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Must be bad. Even sick Sixpack never missed
a meal.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: It’s this fucking air system….</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Ain’t the food or the air system, he’s just
sick… Everybody gets sick every now and then. It’s all part of being
human!</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Well, I must be human because I’m sure as
hell sick.</p>
<p><strong>cobb’s voice</strong>: I guess I’m kinda…outta shape… This
skin condition…what is it? Like herpes, or measles, or what?</p>
<p><strong>doc’s voice</strong>: It’s difficult to describe.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Christ, it’d be a hell of a thing if I went
back to the roof with some kind of herpes thing. My wife wouldn’t
understand that at all…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You seem all right.</p>
<p><strong>cobs</strong>: She wouldn’t understand. She’d think I was
down here fucking my head off.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: This whole thing’s unnecessary, Doc. Only
“skin problem” I got is white people… How come you’re wearing those
gloves?</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: This disease…do you know what causes
it?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Not yet. You got any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You don’t think it was from going on that
ship do you?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That’s a possibility. But if it was that simple
why haven’t the symptoms begun on you?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You mean I’m okay?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You’re fine.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus’ voice</strong>: What do you mean, “a skin problem”…
your skin changes?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It blackens…becomes scaly.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: You mean like a fish?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yes…like a fish…</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: I was just joking, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: The chapter he’s on says: BODY DISPOSAL AT
SEA.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, according to Maritime law, you, as
commander of the Shack have the authority to dispose of the body.
However, the company doesn’t want you to do that.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What you don’t understand is that my crew is
in jeopardy.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: But you don’t have any proof at this point
to assume that this disease is contagious, do you?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I’m not anxious to find out, either.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Beck, trust me. If the company felt that you
or your crew were in any danger we would authorize an immediate
emergency pickup. We could be there in a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Unfortunately. We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What’re you saying? That we’re not even going
to be picked up tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: It shouldn’t be a long delay.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: But it’s a delay! How long? A day? Two
days?!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Twelve hours, no big deal. We should know
something first thing in the morning. Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Bo? Doc says you’re next.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hey, Sixpack…Hey, my man… How you
feeling?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hey, man, we made quota to- day. No thanks to
you, you dog, but we made it…Beck helped us…We just dropped Bowman off.
I hope what you’ve got ain’t catching…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Who were you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Sixpack…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Sleeping. No sign of Doc, though. I’ll check
the control room. You look in the shower room…</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Oh, God…what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Sixpack…what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You have to call them back. Explain that this
is an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Excuse me, sir…Bowman’s sick. She’s
downstairs in the infirmary.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The infirmary?…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Yes sir, ain’t that where we usually go when
we’re sick?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We’re simply concerned about her…proximity
to…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Sixpack’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Bullshit…I was just talking to him. I saw him
move.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What?…</p>
<p><strong>what he sees</strong>: The examination table where Jones left
her is empty. The room deserted.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I left her here.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Bowman?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Bowman. It’s Doc. I’m here to help you.</p>
<p><strong>what he sees</strong>: Bowman. Dead. Her wrists have been cut
and blood swirls down the drain.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I can’t tell you much about it, except that
none of you show any symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: And it killed Bo?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: No…she killed herself.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: We’re getting out of here just in time.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: There’s now a problem with the weather for
pickup. There’s a typhoon in our sector… …We’re going to be delayed
twelve hours…</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Typhoon?!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Twelve hours!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: At least we get time and a half. That’s in the
contract.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Fuck double pay, man! I want out of here!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Jones… Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>what they see</strong>: Both bodies now are in a motionless,
hideous conglomeration on the the table.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: C’mon, Cobb…you’re slacking…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I ain’t, goddamnit…It’s Jones!..</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Shut up, all of you.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Mr. Beck, the contract states that no body can
be disposed of without authorization of—</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Fuck the contract, man!</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Hey!…I feel something. It’s moving! He’s
alive!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I feel it, too…Someone’s trying to get
out.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Cobb, what’re you doing!</p>
<p><strong>cobs</strong>: But he ain’t dead! He ain’t dead.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Cobb! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It bit me! It bit me!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Push Hazy!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Oh, Jesus Christ! I ain’t never gonna sleep
again!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: It bit me!</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: It’s Sixpack!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I’m going to kill it!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Close the Lock! Now!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I think we just found our problem.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Serves his ass right to get it.
Motherfucker brings that shit onboard. I hope his fucking ass rots in
the sea and is shit upon by the fish.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: ’Fucker could have gotten us all killed.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: He knew better than that.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You guys sure weren’t so holy when you were
shooting that vodka…It could have been you.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Hold it! Rewind it.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Back it up slowly.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: You know that Innsbruck has 64 square miles
of ski slopes, man? Think about that. Sixty-four square miles.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: How’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: What? That?…I’ve done this one before. You
hungry? I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hungry? After what we just went through I may
never eat again.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: They found this?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No. I think they isolated him in genetic
engineering. Homo aquaticus…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Was there such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Danakil man?…one of our ancestors. Named for
the Danakil Alps in Ethiopia.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Not exactly a big ocean country.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It was when it counted a couple of million
years ago when the seas came in and drove us into the water. Most homo
sapiens didn’t make it…Danakil man… adapted.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Some say that’s why we’re basically hairless,
for less water resistance, faster swimming speeds…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: But what about those scales… or that
leech-like thing that bit Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why stop with just one aspect of marine life?
Why not incorporate the best genetic components the ocean has to
offer?…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Well, if they were perfecting an aquaman, then
why’s there a dead one onboard that Russian ship? Why isn’t he out
swimming around?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He obviously lacked something in his
environment.</p>
<p><strong>jones’ voice</strong>: Turned black yet?</p>
<p><strong>cobs</strong>: That ain’t funny.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Relax, Cobb. If it was going to turn, it
would have done its trick by now.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: That’s easy for you to say. You ain’t the one
that got bit.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Don’t tell me you’re getting soft on us,
Cobbie? You’re the fellow who always said–</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Nothing’s changed, goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Man, everybody is jumpy… What are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Getting some food.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Under there?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Look. Water.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Probably the plumbing. You gonna make me
finish that puzzle by myself, or what?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: No, I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Mustard. Need mustard…</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Sixpack…</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hey, Hazy…what’re you doing now…cooking?</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Help me, Jonesy. Oh, God, help me! It’s
getting inside me, I can feel it!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hazy, please…I’m going to get you some help,
man…just don’t touch me…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: It’s Hazy…It’s got him! Stay here and don’t
let him out. I’m going to get the Doc.</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Help me! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: It’s got Hazy!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What has?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: One of those chunks of Sixpack! Like a big
leech, with those teeth!…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We’ve got to get him to the infirmary.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What are you going to do to him?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m going to try to remove it.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I’ve got Cobbie downstairs watching the
door.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Cobb? Hazy? Oh, shit…He’s gone…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: You let him get away!</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I ain’t doing nothing for that thing without
something to defend myself.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: That thing happens to be my friend.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Shut up, both of you! We’ve got to find
it.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Oh, God, she’s out there…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Jones…come with me. Cobb, you and Doc check
the rooms.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Willie…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What on earth’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I ought to smack your face!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: DeJesus…It’s got him.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I thought they were your friends?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Were, Doss were.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: You fire that in here and you’ll bring the
whole place down.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Jones to Doc. Doc?…Cobb?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: No, it’s not going through. The intercom’s
busted. I thought DeJesus fixed that?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: He did.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It…almost got you.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>cobs</strong>: I saw it! It’s big!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Big?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Bigger than DeJesus? How?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It’s had a meal.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It needs blood?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Fucking great…You telling me we got a fucking
dracula in here with us?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It would explain the suction- like
appendages.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Like a leech.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: That’s why there’s a dead one on the ship. It
ran out of blood.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What dead one on the ship?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The monster appears to be a genetic
aberration…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: No fuckin’ lie…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: …It has many traits of deep sea marine
life…regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy… but the
fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the
communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality…</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: What?…What?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: That it acquires intelligence from its
victims?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Intelligence may not be the right word…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Fuck semantics, Doc! You saying its like part
DeJesus, part Sixpack, part Bowman?!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I don’t know. I’m guessing.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: I say we should go get in the escape bubbles
and get the hell out of here!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: And hit the surface in the middle of a
typhoon?…No, thank you. I’ll take my chance down here.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What can we do?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Our only chance is to lure it to the Swamp and
flush it like we did the other.</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: And how’re we going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Be careful with it.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Don’t worry, I don’t want to give up any
more.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Still bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>cobb</strong>: Itches like hell.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Take it off and let me have a look.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Looks good to me. I’ll re-bandage it,
though.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You can’t go out there alone.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m the Doctor. I have to do what’s best for
this crew. I need my bag.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: There, good as new. Just keep your paws off of
it. Do you have the new bandage ready?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Doc?…Doc!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I hear something. Don’t fire until we’re both
in the Swamp.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Don’t worry…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: C’mon baby c’mon…</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Beck? Jones!?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Run Willie! Run!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Well done. Just like momma makes ’em.</p>
<p><strong>reaches out from the shadows, and pulls her into the
dark</strong>: DOORWAY TO THE MACHINE FLOOR—-IT IS JONES! He pulls her
between him and Beck in the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Where’s Cobb and Doc?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Cobb’s cut…It was in him! It got Doc…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Oh man, that’s just great…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Shit! He sent them all.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: The escape bubbles?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>on screen we see doc’s message</strong>: “…hope that our
sacrifice will mean that the human race will never know this awful
mutation…”</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: The good doctor signed our death warrant.</p>
<p><strong>hundred sledgehammers pounding the heavy steel door
trying</strong>: TO BREAK IT DOWN. Jones readies his weapon but just as
suddenly, the BANGING STOPS. Beck, Willie and Jones all nervously
exchange looks.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, at least we’re safe inside here.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thank goodness, you’re still alive!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Hey, man, you better get your ass out here
right now and get us. You hear me, motherfucker? Right now!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Please relax, Mr. Jones. Every- thing is
under control. Naturally, when we received Dr. Warren’s message we were
concerned but would never have deserted you.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: When are you coming for us?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Well, that’s the bad news. The typhoon did
turn your way. Right now it is on a course–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Just answer the question, man! When are you
coming?!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Hopefully in the next 48 hours.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Forty-eight hours!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I realize you must have gone through
hell–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Gone? Man, we’re still here!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I can’t change the weather. Try to get some
rest. I’ll keep you posted.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: He’s right. Why don’t you get some rest. I’ll
stand the first watch.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Martin, you asshole…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: They know, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Yeah…I think they’re just deciding what to do
with us.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Maybe they already have.</p>
<p><strong>on screen we see</strong>: Stock prices.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Seeing how my stock’s doing…</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: The words TransOcean Corp. The capsulized
report comes up on screen: “TransOcean Corp. took a bath on world
markets today when news of a tragic mining accident was revealed to
investors. The Board of Directors….”</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Where?….</p>
<p><strong>the screen</strong>: “…accident took place in Shack Six,
Southeast Sector of Pacific Zone 10…Seven dead. All bodies missing.”
Their names follow.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I can’t believe they’d just leave us.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Welcome to the union, boss. We’re all
expendable.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: The air’s stopped.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: We’re on backup air.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How much time does that give us?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Less than an hour. It’s ruptured an air
duct.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Can’t we fix it?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: There’re twenty miles of pipe in the bilge,
they could have tapped-in anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>suddenly we hear a sound we haven’t heard in a long
time.</strong>: The RATTLE THAT JONES AND COBB FIXED. Jones and Beck
home in on the tell-tale noise.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Cobb…Job security…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: They’re drawing us out.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You can’t go out there, that’s what they
want.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: We don’t have much choice… without air, the
internal pressure will fall and–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Crunch…Implosion.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: You don’t think I’m sitting in here, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: The shack…</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: She’s wondering what’s happening. We’re
losing air faster than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Which way?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I’ll go first.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Don’t spend all day down there.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Don’t fuckin’ worry, I ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Okay, Williams…let’s hear a tune. “Off we
go…into the wild blue yonder…”</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Jesus Christ…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Can you fix it?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: No way…</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Think! Can we stop it?! Block it up?! Shut
down the line somewhere?! Think!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I am thinking, man! You think I want to die!
I am thinking! I–</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: I hit it. But I can’t see it! Can you see
it?!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: The Swamp. There’s an over- ride switch in
the Swamp.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Hurry…Get out!</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Hey, you?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Jones! Get your feet out of the water!</p>
<p><strong>the shack continues to shake, each jolt stronger than
the</strong>: LAST. As they emerge Willie helps them.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: C’mon, the Swamp!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Beck!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Go on!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: That’s an order!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Fuck your orders!</p>
<p><strong>corridors…and suddenly the floor gives way beneath
willie!</strong>: She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings
to the firm ground.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It’s jammed!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Where the hell’ve you been?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I got hung up! Try this!</p>
<p><strong>the recorded female voice intones</strong>: “Five minutes to
implosion.” And we feel it happening:</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: It won’t go!</p>
<p><strong>the female voice intones</strong>: “Four minutes…”</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: The suits! Get in them!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: The suits! Are you crazy! How’re we going to
get to the surface?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Like this.</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Your suit, Becky!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Just get in yours!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Look out!</p>
<p><strong>jones/radio</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>willie/radio</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Go, now! That’s an order!</p>
<p><strong>dejesus</strong>: Kill me…Kill me!</p>
<p><strong>the recorded female voice sounds</strong>: “One minute to
implosion…”</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Light. Beck, I see light!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Wait till you reach thirty- five before you
blow your suit…</p>
<p><strong>willie’s voice</strong>: Roger.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Ejecting.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: We made it!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Where’s Jones?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: What happened to that typhoon?</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Are you sure you saw something?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: How many times I got to tell you. I saw a
ship.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Well, why haven’t they answered our
flares?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: We’ll fire one more, that leaves us one last
one.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Are you okay, Jonesy?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Tip top, Willie…tip top.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: Who’s the best power forward in the
NBA…Jameson?</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Jameson? Who are you trying to con…?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I’ll be damned. Look!…A flare!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It saw us!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Answer them and quit kicking me!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m not touching you!</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: No…no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I thought you said you’d combed this
area?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: We did….Many times.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Initiate rescue.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: It hit me! Where are they?!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I can’t see them!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: All right! I’ve had enough of this shit! You
want meat, motherfucker? Come on, eat me, sucker, try some dark
meat!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Jonesy…Give me your hand!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: C’mon, Jones!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Jonesy, No!</p>
<p><strong>jones</strong>: Get out of here, Becky!</p>
<p><strong>winch operator</strong>: Is he in the harness!</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: C’mon, motherfucker open up!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Mr. Beck, I understand you passed your
physical with flying colors. And Ms. Williams?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: I don’t know yet, she’s still in there.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Well, you’ll be glad to know you have a
friend onboard.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Beck! I told them you’d make it. No one back
at TransOcean believed me, but I never gave up on you once. So, how are
you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>beck</strong>: Better…A lot better.</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: I’m fine!</p>
<p><strong>things like anglers, lobsters, crabs…miniature
leviathan.</strong>: The sight is almost too intense for Beck and
Willie. The Captain notices.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I thought we might have some wonderful
seafood. But, if there’s something else you’d rather have…</p>
<p><strong>willie</strong>: How about a burger and fries?</p>
