<h1 id="the-sixth-sense">the-sixth-sense</h1>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: That’s one fine frame. A fine frame it
is.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How much does a fine frame like that cost,
you think?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’ve never told you… but you sound a little
like Dr. Seuss when you’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Anna, I’m serious. Serious I am, Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Mahogany. I’d say that cost at least a couple
hundred. Maybe three.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Three? We should hock it. Buy a C.D. rack
for the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Do you know how important this is? This is big
time. I’m going to read it for you, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do I really sound like Dr. Seuss?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: In recognition for his outstanding achievement
in the field of child psychology, his dedication to his work, and his
continuing efforts to improve the quality of life for countless children
and their families, the City of Philadelphia proudly bestows upon its
son Dr. Malcolm Crowe… That’s you… the Mayor’s Citation for Professional
Excellence.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wow. They called you their son.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: We can keep it in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s not real, Anna. Some secretary wrote
that up. Don’t tell me you thought it was real?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t do the quiet thing. You know I hate
it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: This is an important night for us. Finally
someone is recognizing the sacrifices you made. That you have put
everything second, including me, for those families they’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: They’re also saying that my husband has a
gift. Not an ordinary gift that allows him to hit a ball over a fence.
Or a gift that lets him produce beautiful images on a canvas… Your gift
teaches children how to be strong in situations where most adults would
piss on themselves. Yes, I believe what they wrote about you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What are we hugging about again?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nothing. There wasn’t supposed to be any
crying at this celebration. Just a lot of drinking and sex.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I would like some red wine in a glass.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I would not like it in a mug. I would not
like it in a jug.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Bulb’s out.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He’s still in the house.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Anna, don’t move. Don’t say a word.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: This is forty-seven Locust Street. You have
broken a window and entered a private residence. Do you understand what
I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: You don’t know so many things.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: There are no needles or prescription drugs
of any kind in this house.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Did you get him drunk?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Do you know why you’re scared when you’re
alone?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What do you want? I don’t understand what
you want.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: What you promised.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: –My God.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: –Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Let’s all celebrate, Dr. Malcolm Crowe.
Recipient of awards from the Mayor on the news. Dr. Malcolm Crowe, he’s
helped so many children… And he doesn’t even remember my name?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: I was ten when you worked with me.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Downtown clinic? Single parent family? I
had a possible mood disorder… I had no friends… you said I was socially
isolated. I was afraid – you called it acute anxiety… You were wrong.
Come on, clear your head… Male, nine… Single parent… Mood discorder…
Acute anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: I’m nineteen. I have drugs in my system
twenty-four hours a day… I still have no friends. I still have no peace.
I’m still afraid.</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: …I’m still afraid.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Please give me a second to think.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Bed Freidken?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: Some people call me freak.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: …Ronald… Ronald Sumner?</p>
<p><strong>stranger</strong>: I am a freak.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: –Vincent?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Vincent Gray?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I do remember you, Vincent. You were a good
kid. Very smart… Quiet… Compassionate… Unusually compassionate…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You forgot cursed.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You failed me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Vincent… I’m sorry I didn’t help you… I can
try to help you now.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Pro… Fun… Add…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s okay, Cole. Don’t be frightened.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: My name is Dr. Malcolm Crowe. I was
supposed to meet you today. Sorry I missed our appointment.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do you mind if I sit down? I have this
injury from a couple of years ago and it flares up every once in a while
just so I won’t forget it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Your eye frames. They don’t seem to have
any lenses in them.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They’re my dad’s. The lenses hurt my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I knew there was a sound explanation.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What was that you were saying before with
your soldiers? Day pro fun.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: …De profundis clamo ad te domine.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s called Latin. It’s a language.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: All your soldiers speak Latin?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, just one.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I like churches, too. In olden times, in
Europe, people used to hide in churches. Claim sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What were they hiding from?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oh, lots of things, I suppose. Bad people
for one. People who wanted to imprison them. Hurt them.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Nothing bad can happen in a church, right?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I forgot your name.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Dr. Crowe.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You’re a doctor. What kind?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I work with young people who might be sad
or upset or just want to talk. I try to help them figure things out.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Are you a good doctor?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I got an award once. From the Mayor.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Thank you. It was a long time ago. I’ve
kind of been retired for a while. You’re my very first client back.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You use needles?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Not even little ones that aren’t supposed to
hurt?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’m going to see you again, right?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: If it’s okay with you?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s okay with me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: And Cole, next time I won’t be late for
you.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Next time I won’t be scared of you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: …The mass for the dead.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Cole.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Your Cocoa Puffs are getting soggy.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You got a spot.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Something you were looking for, baby?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Pop Tarts.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: They’re right here.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What are you thinking, Momma?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Lots of things.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Anything bad about me?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Look at my face.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I wasn’t thinking anything bad about you, got
it?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That’s Tommy, Momma.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Don’t you want this?</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Hey freak, how’d you like the “arm around
your shoulder” bit. I just made it up. Went with it. That’s what great
actors do. It’s called improv.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Be careful… I hope no one jumps out and gets
you.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: How was school, baby?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You know, you can tell me things if you need
to.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Well, you know what I did today?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I won the Pennsylvania Lottery in the morning.
I quit my jobs. Ate a big picnic in the park with lots of chocolate
mouses pie and then swam in the fountain all afternoon… What did you
do?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I was picked first for kickball teams at
recess. I hit a grand slam to win the game and everyone lifted me up on
their shoulders and carried me around cheering.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’ll make triangle pancakes. You got an
hour.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You want to sit?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t feel like talking right now?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How about we play a game first?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s a mind-reading game… Did I mention I
could read minds?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Here’s the game. I’ll read your mind. If
what I say is right, you take a step forwards the chair. If I’m wrong,
you take a step backwards the doorway. If you reach the chair, you sit.
If you reach the door, you can go. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Just after your mom and dad were divorced,
your mom went to a doctor like me and it didn’t help her. And so you
think I’m not going to help you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’re worried because she said she told
him things. Things she couldn’t tell anybody else. Secrets.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You have a secret. But you don’t want to
tell me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You don’t have to tell me your secret if
you don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Your father gave you that watch as a
present before he left.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: He forgot it in a drawer. It doesn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You don’t like to say much at school.
You’re an excellent student however. You’ve never been in any kind of
serious trouble.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: We were supposed to draw a picture. Anything
we wanted… I drew a man. He got hurt in the neck by another man with a
screwdriver.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You saw that on T.V., Cole?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Everybody got upset. They had a meeting. Momma
started crying. I don’t draw like that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How do you draw now?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I draw people with smiles, dogs running, and
rainbows. They don’t have meetings about rainbows.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I guess they don’t.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What am I thinking now?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You’re thinking… I don’t know what you’re
thinking, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I was thinking… you’re nice. But you can’t
help me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I thought you meant the other Italian
restaurant I asked you to marry me in.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m so sorry. I can’t seem to keep track of
time.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It didn’t go well today. Spent some time
after trying to get my head together.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: They’re so similar, Anna. They have the
same mannerisms. The same expressions. The same thing hanging over them.
It might be some kind of abuse.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: There are cuts on Cole’s arms. Fingernail
marks, I think. Looks like defensive cuts.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Possibly a teacher, neighbor. I don’t think
it’s the mother. Just a gut thing. The way she deals with him. It
doesn’t fit. Hard to say this early. Could just be a child climbing a
lot of trees.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I know I’ve been kind of out of it for a
long while and you resent it. You do. I know you’re mad. I know it’s put
some distance between us.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: But I’m getting a second chance here. I
can’t let it slip away.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: …Happy Anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You want to ask me a question?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: See, this is why I lose at poker. Yes, I do
have a question.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What happened to those two? Being under
tissue paper can’t be a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That’s Private Jenkins and Private Kinney.
They got killed. Private Jenkins has a baby girl that was born seven
pounds, six ounces. He’s never seen her. He wanted to get back to Blue
Bell, Pennsylvania and hold her…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Private Kinney’s wife is really sick – she has
something called a brain anism.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You mean aneurysm.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Yeah, Private Kinney needed to get back safe
to take care of her.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s sad they died, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Don’t look at me. I don’t like people looking
at me like that.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Stop looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Where should I look then, Cole?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Look over there.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s very unusual for someone your age to
understand the kind of problems that Private Jenkins and Private Kinney
have or even to be thinking about them at all…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It is okay if I look back now?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Tap the foot once for “No” and twice for
“Yes.”</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You wouldn’t want to take a walk, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I walk this way to school with Tommy
Tammisimo.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: He your best buddy?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: He hates me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You hate him?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Your mom set that up?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You ever tell her about how it is with
Tommy?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I don’t tell her a thing.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Cause she doesn’t look at me like everybody
and I don’t want her to. I don’t want her to know.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Know what?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That I’m a freak.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Listen to me. You are not a freak. Don’t
you believe anybody that tells you that. It’s bullshit and you don’t
have to grow up believing that.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You said the “s” word.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yeah. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Is it okay if I do something? I have to do
something.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Hi, Mr. Marschal.</p>
<p><strong>mr. marschal</strong>: Guten Tag, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mr. marschal</strong>: Mrs. Marschal. She went food shopping.
She’s running late.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Ich Habe Durst.</p>
<p><strong>mr. marschal</strong>: Wunderbar! Where did you learn to
speak German?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I just know a couple lines.</p>
<p><strong>mr. marschal</strong>: Yes, you may have a drink. What would
you like?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Lemonade, please.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Mr. Marschal gets real lonely.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What about Mrs. Marschal?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: She died a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>mr. marschal</strong>: Maybe Jill will play for us when she
gets back.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Cole–</p>
<p><strong>mr. marschal</strong>: What’s going on there?</p>
<p><strong>mr. marschal</strong>: Is this for me?</p>
<p><strong>mr. maschal</strong>: What’s this? Jill’s keeping a
diary.</p>
<p><strong>mr. marschal</strong>: She’s full of surprises…</p>
<p><strong>mr. marschal</strong>: She hasn’t written anything for some
time.</p>
<p><strong>mr. marschal</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Stop looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: April or March of Eighty-seven. Two weeks
into sessions with Vincent Gray. I was treating a couple, Donald and
Robin Wagner, who had lost their child to Leukemia. They were waiting
with Vincent in the reception room of the downtown clinic. They were
alone together maybe fifteen minutes. When I entered the room, all three
were crying. The Wagner’s progress from that afternoon was dramatic and
sudden …. As if some door had been opened for them. I’m not at all clear
what happened in those fifteen minutes. But I now believe Vincent tried
to tell me something, show me something and I didn’t listen. Cole Sear
allowed me to witness something today. This time I’m going to
listen.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: …So your dad lives in Pittsburgh with a
lady who works in a toll booth.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t know. I was just thinking the same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sometimes, we don’t even know it, but we do
things to draw attention. Do things so we can express how we feel about
issues… Divorce or whatever.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: One night, as an example… leave something
on a desk for someone to find.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Cole, have you ever heard of something
called free-writing? Or free-association writing?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s when you put a pencil in your hand and
put the pencil to a paper and you just start writing… You don’t think
about what you’re writing… You don’t read over what you’re writing… You
just keep your hand moving.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: After awhile if you keep your hand moving
long enough, words and thoughts start coming out you didn’t even know
you had in you… Sometimes they’re things you heard from somewhere…
Sometimes they’re feelings deep inside… Have you ever done any free-
association writing, Cole?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What’d you write?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Words.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What kind of words?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Upset words.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Did you ever write any upset words before
your father left?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Can you do something for me?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Think about what you want from our time
together. What our goal should be?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Something I want?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: If we could change something in your life,
anything at all, what would you like that to be?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You don’t have to answer now.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Instead of something I want, can I have
something I don’t want?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I don’t want to be scared anymore.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Are you calling me?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Give it up, kid.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: Can anyone guess what city was the
capital of the United States of America from 1790 to 1800?</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: …I’ll give you a hint, it’s the city
you live in.</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: Right… Philadelphia is one of the
oldest cities in the country. A lot of generations have lived and died
in this city… Almost every place you visit has a history and a story
behind it. Even this school and the grounds they sit on… Can anyone
guess what this building was used for a hundred years ago, before you
went here, before I went to this school even?</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: Yes, Cole?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They used to hang people here.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: That’s not correct. Where’d you hear
that?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They’d pull the people in crying and kissing
their families bye… People watching would spit at them.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: Cole, this was a legal courthouse.
Laws were passed here. Some of the first laws of this country. This
building was full of lawyers. Lawmakers.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They were the ones who hanged everybody.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: I don’t know which one of these guys
told you that, but they were just trying to scare you, I think.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I don’t like people looking at me like
that.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: I don’t know how else to look–</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You’re a stuttering Stanley!</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You talked funny when you went to school here.
You talked funny all the way to high school!</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: What–</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You shouldn’t laugh at people. It makes them
feel bad.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: How did you–?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Stop looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: Who have you been s-speaking to?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: Who!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Stuttering Stanley!</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: S-ssstop that!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Stuttering Stanley! Stuttering Stanley!</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: S-ssssstop it!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Stuttering–</p>
<p><strong>mr. cunningham</strong>: –Shhhhhhut upppp you
fffffffreak!</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Hey, big guy.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I don’t want to talk about anything.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do you like magic?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Watch the penny closely.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I do the magic shake…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: And suddenly the penny has magically
traveled to my left hand…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: But that’s not the end of the trick. With
another magic shake, the penny travels into my shirt pocket…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: But that’s still not the end!… I do a final
magic shake… and suddenly… The penny returns to the hand where it
started from.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: That isn’t magic.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You just kept the penny in that hand the whole
time…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Who me?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I didn’t know you were funny.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I forgot myself.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Cole…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: One day… You’re going to sound just like
them.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Promise.</p>
<p>****: No doubt about it. Anna’s like my sister. You better make her
happy… And I’m not talking about – mmm this tastes like real butter –
kind of happy… I’m talking about Julie Andrews twirling around like a
mental patient on a mountain top – kind of happy.</p>
<p>****: You’re really lucky. She’s got so much love for you. Don’t tell
her I told you, but she said she loved you from the first time she met
you on the street. She’d do anything for you. I love you guys. My nose
is running. Why isn’t someone getting me a tissue?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: …Then you do the magic shake. And now the
penny moves from my pocket all the way to the hand it started in.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: That’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s supposed to be funny.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: It’s stupid.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Give me my penny back.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: …Don’t be sad.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: What’d you say?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: …Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: …He doesn’t get invited places.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s mom</strong>: It’s our pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a
year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn’t come
out.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s mom</strong>: Chuck E. who?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Cheese. It’s a kid’s place.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: He’s my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I work at an insurance place and at Penny’s,
so Cole can go to that good school.</p>
<p><strong>darren’s mom</strong>: J. C. Jenny’s?</p>
<p><strong>darren’s mom</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I wish I could be like my momma though. She
always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Cole’s going through something bad. He won’t
talk to me. I’m his momma. And I don’t know what’s wrong and I don’t
know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. weston</strong>: Did you have the Brie?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. saunders</strong>: It tasted like cheese whiz.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: I even got a trailer.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: For what? You only had one line.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: You’re slow, you know that. The star of the
commercial always has his own trailer. You need to think about your
character alone.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Darren, check it out.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: My dad made me invite him.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Happy birthday, Darren.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Something you want to see in there?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: –No.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: We’re going to put on a pretend play. You
want to be in it?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: …Okay.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: It’s called, “Locked in the Dungeon.”</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Yeah, Cole… you get to be the one locked in
the dungeon.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Don’t!</p>
<p><strong>darren’s mother</strong>: Who’s making that noise?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Cole!</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Help me get him in the car.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What’s wrong with Cole?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hill</strong>: The tests indicate he did not have a
seizure. In fact he’s doing fine. After some rest, he could go home
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: There’s something else going on, Lynn.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hill</strong>: There are some scratches and bruises on
your son that concern me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Oh, man.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Those are from sports, from playing. He’s not
the most coordinated kid, but I don’t want him to stop trying, you know
what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hill</strong>: Mrs. Sloan over there is our social worker
at the hospital. She’s going to ask you some procedural questions.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You think I hurt my child? You think I’m a bad
mother?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hill</strong>: At this point it’s just procedure. And you
should probably calm down.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How do you expect her to react?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You want me to answer your questions?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hill</strong>: I’m sorry if I was being vague – yes, I
do.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Who’s going to answer mine, you dick.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What happened to my child today?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Something was happening to him – physically
happening. Something was very wrong.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: How long will these questions take?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’ve decided we shouldn’t schedule sessions
anymore. I’ll just follow you around.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Your father ever tell you bedtime
stories?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Once upon a time there was a prince, who
was being driven around… He drove around for a long, long time… Driving
and driving… It was a long trip… He fell asleep… When he woke up, they
were still driving… The long drive went on–</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Dr. Crowe.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You haven’t told bedtime stories before?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You have to add some twists and stuff. Maybe
they run out of gas.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No gas… Hey, that’s good.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Tell me a story about why you’re sad.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do you think I’m sad?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What makes you think that?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Your eyes told me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m not supposed to talk about stuff like
that.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: …Once upon a time there was this person
named Malcolm. He worked with children. Loved it more than anything.
Then one night, he finds out he made a mistake with one of them. Didn’t
help that one at all. He thinks about that one a lot. Can’t forget. Ever
since then, things have been different. He’s become messed up. Confused.
Angry. Not the same person he used to be. His wife doesn’t like the
person he’s become. They don’t speak anymore. They’re like
strangers.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: And then one day this person Malcolm meets
a wonderful boy who reminds him of that one. Reminds him a lot of that
one. Malcolm decides to try to help this new boy. He thinks maybe if he
can help this boy, it would be like helping that one too.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t know how the story ends. I hope
it’s a happy ending.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I want to tell you my secret now.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: …I see people.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I see dead people… Some of them scare me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: In your dreams?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: When you’re awake?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Dead people, like in graves and
coffins?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No, walking around, like regular people… They
can’t see each other. Some of them don’t know they’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: They don’t know they’re dead?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I see ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: They tell me stories… Things that happened to
them… Things that happened to people they know.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: How often do you see them?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: All the time. They’re everywhere. You won’t
tell anyone my secret, right?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: …No.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Will you stay here till I fall asleep?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Cole… His pathology is more severe than
initially assessed. He’s suffering from visual hallucinations, paranoia
– Symptoms of some kind of school age Schizophrenia. Medication and
hospitalization may be required.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m not helping him.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Hi, this is Lynn Sear, Cole’s mother. I wonder
if we could talk about your son and his friends keeping their goddamn
hands off my boy?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Momma? Dream about daddy again?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You can’t hurt me anymore!</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: There once was a boy, very different than
other boys. He lived in the jungle, and he could talk with the
animals.</p>
<p><strong>the audience applauds as the full cast of the actors come
out.</strong>: Some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and
animals.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Did you think the play sucked big time?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Tommy Tammisimo acted in a cough syrup
commercial. He thought everybody was self-conscious and unrealistic. He
said the play sucked big time.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I know every child is special in their own
way, but Tommy sounds like a punk. I thought the play was excellent.
Better than Cats.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Cats?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Cole, I was really interested in what you
told me in the hospital, I’d like to hear more about it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Is something in there?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t see.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Be real still.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Sometimes you feel it inside. Like you’re
falling down real fast, but you’re really just standing still.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You ever feel prickly things on the back of
your neck?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: And the tiny hairs on your arm. Are they all
standing up?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: – Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: When they get mad, it gets cold.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Them?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t see anything. Are you sure they’re
there? Cole?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Please make them leave.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: …Is anyone there?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I can’t talk now.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I thought about you too.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I don’t care what they say, this thing is
definitely broken.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Mommy, my throat hurts.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Pediaease Cough Suppressant… gentle, fast,
effective.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Take ’em off.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I don’t want them on my table.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I saw what was in your bureau drawer when I
was cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You got something you want to confess?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: The bumble bee pendant. Why do you keep taking
it?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: It was Grandma’s. It’s not for playing. What
if it broke? You know how sad I’d be.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You’d cry. Cause you miss grandma so much.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: That’s right. So why do you take it,
sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Sometimes people think they lose things and
they didn’t really lose them. It just gets moved.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Did you move the bumble bee pendant?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You didn’t take it before. You didn’t take it
the time after that. And now, you didn’t take it again?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Don’t get mad.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: So who moved it?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: There’s only two of us. Maybe someone came in
our house – took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid
it nicely in your drawer? Is that what happened?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’m so tired, Cole. I’m tired in my body. I’m
tired in my mind. I’m tired in my heart. I need a little help here. I
don’t know if you noticed – but our little family isn’t doing so
good.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’m praying for us, but I must not be praying
right. It looks like we’re just going to have to answer each other’s
prayers. If we can’t talk to each other – we’re not going to make it.
Now baby, tell me… I won’t be mad, honey… Did you take the bumble bee
pendant?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You’ve had enough roast beef. You need to
leave the table.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Come on… I’ll show you where my dad keeps his
gun… Come on.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: If you’re not very mad… Can I sleep in your
room tonight?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Look at my face, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’m not very mad.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Baby… Why are you shaking?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Cole, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: …Please tell me.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s Edwardian. Beautifully worked. Entirely
platinum with a mine cut diamond and an actual color Burmese Sapphire…
It’s timeless.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You got anything a little plainer?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Plainer? You want a plain ring to go
with your plain fiance. Is that how it is?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: No, baby. Don’t get in a tizzy. It’s
just… you’re so beautiful… you’re like a Burmese Sapphire all by
yourself. You don’t need all that.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why don’t you two hold it?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Do you feel longing?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: When I touch this piece I feel a longing. I
imagine the woman who owned this, loved a man deeply she couldn’t be
with.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Did he have wavy hair and broad
shoulders?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know… But maybe… A lot of the pieces
in this store give me feelings. I think maybe when people own things and
then they pass away – a part of themselves gets printed on those things
– like fingerprints.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: You don’t need someone with a masters. You
need a wrestler guy whose neck is larger than his head.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I need a wrestler with a masters.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: From you?</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Is it wrestling tights?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s a first edition.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: Wow, this is too much. It’s perfect, Anna.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Let’s rent a movie.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Your pick.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: It can even have Jean Claude Van Damme in it
if you want.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Momma, look out!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You don’t wanna ask me questions today?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Can I ask you then?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What do you want more than anything?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I told you what I want.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t know, Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Why don’t you think about it for a while?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I know what I want. My goal is to speak to
my wife. The way she and I used to speak. Like there was no one in the
world but us.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: How are you going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I can’t be your doctor anymore. I haven’t
given my family enough attention. Bad things happen when you do that. Do
you understand?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You want to go home?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I have to.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Soon. One week.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I’m going to transfer you. I know two
psychologists that are exceptional–</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Don’t fail me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: –What?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Don’t give up. You’re the only one who can
help me. I know it.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You want to know a secret?… I was a paper
champion. Do you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I means I wasn’t what everyone thought I
was… I was a fake.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You weren’t a paper champion.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Someone else can help you. Someone else can
make you happy.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Dr. Crowe?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You believe me, right?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Dr. Crowe, you believe my secret, right?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t know how to answer that.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: How can you help me if you don’t believe
me?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Some magic’s real.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Sorry about that. Hope I didn’t leave you
alone too long… Wow, it’s cold in here.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Vincent… Why are you crying? Vincent?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What happened? Did something upset you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You won’t believe.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I won’t believe what?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I don’t want to talk anymore. I want to go
home, okay? I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Okay, Vincent, you can go home.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: –about that. Hope I didn’t leave you too
long… Wow, it’s cold in here–</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: –like needles either. When I was a kid, I
had this blood test down – threw up chill cheese fries all over this
male nurse.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Excuse me, Doctor Reed is on line
two.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Vincent, I have to take this. Give me a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>man’s whispering</strong>: Familia… No dejen que esto me
pase… Mi familia… Yo no quiero morir… Familia…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: …Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Hello again.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You been running around?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It makes you feel better?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I like to run around. It’s good exercise. You
want to ask me questions now?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You want to be a lance corporal in Company M,
3rd Battalion, 7th Marines? We’re being dispatched to the Quang Nam
province.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Something happened, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes, it did.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Are you wigging out?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: We’re not gonna start crying again, are
we?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No, we’re not.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: These people… People that died and are
still hanging around. Maybe they weren’t ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You really look better.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Maybe they wake up that morning thinking
they have a thousand things to do and a thousand days left to do them
in… And then all of a sudden, it’s all taken away. No one asked them.
It’s just gone…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You have nice red in your cheeks now.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Do you know what ‘Yo no quiero morir’
is?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: It’s Spanish. It means… ‘I don’t want to
die.’ Not all the ghosts are scary, are they? Like Mrs. Marschal?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What do those ghosts want when they talk to
you? Think real careful now, Cole…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Just help.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Yes! I think that’s right!… I think they
all want that. Even the scary ones…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You believe now?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I believe both of you now. And I think I
might know how to make them go away.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I think they know you’re one of those guys
rare people can see them. You need to help them. Each one of them.
Everyone wants to be heard. Everyone.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What if they don’t want help? What if they’re
just angry and they want to hurt somebody?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t think that’s the way it works,
Cole.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: How do you know for sure?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: …You just walked out. You’re probably on your
way home. I’m leaving this message… I just didn’t get to say what I
meant… I know you’re confused. It’s just… I’m not prepared to do this,
Sean. I don’t want to be ashamed of that. I don’t want to have to make
excuses for that. And I wanted to tell you… I bought your present
wholesale from a friend. I didn’t even pay tax on it. You don’t need
someone cheap like that. By the way, it’s a non-refundable item, it’s
scratched on the bottom. Are you smiling?… I hope you’re smiling. I’ll
see you at the store.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Cole… Cole, what’s happening…</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Cole, what’s happening to you?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Is someone hurting you?… I’ll beat their
asses.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Momma, you sleep now.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m feeling much better now.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’m feeling much better.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Do you want to tell me something?</p>
<p><strong>shackled man</strong>: My name’s not Sullivan!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: She came a long way to visit me, didn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I guess she did.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Her little sister?</p>
<p><strong>visitor #1</strong>: …can you imagine being a child in a bed

<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I hope nobody got hurt.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You’re very quiet. You’re mad I missed the
play, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I have two jobs, baby. You know how important
they are for us.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’d give anything to have been there.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’m ready to communicate with you now.</p>

<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I would never think that about you … ever… Got
it?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Just let me think for a second.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Grandma says hi.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: She says she’s sorry for taking the bumble bee
pendant. She just likes it a lot.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Grandma comes to visit me sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Cole, that’s very wrong. Grandma’s gone. You
know that.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: She wanted me to tell you–</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Cole, please stop.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: She wanted me to tell you, she saw you
dance.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: She said when you were little, you and her had
a fight right before your dance recital. You thought she didn’t come to
see you dance. She did.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: She hid in the back so you wouldn’t see… She
said you were like an angel.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: She said, you came to her where they buried
her. Asked her a question… She said the answer is “Everyday.”</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What did you ask?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Do I make her proud?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Anna, I’ve been so lost. I need my best
friend.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I miss you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why, Malcolm?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What, Anna? What did I do? What’s made you
so sad?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why did you leave me?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I didn’t leave you.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I think I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I just needed to do a couple of things. And
I needed to tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You were never second… Ever.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: You sleep now, Anna. Everything will be
different in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Goodnight, Malcolm.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Goodnight, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: …I think I’ve had too much to drink.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: I just have to say, this day today has been
one very special day… I wish we all could stay and play.</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Anna, I never thought I’d feel the things
I’m feeling. I never thought I’d be able to stand up in front of my
friends and family and tell them what’s inside me… Today I can…</p>
<p><strong>malcolm</strong>: Anna Crowe… I am in love. In love I am.</p>
