<p><strong>summerall</strong>: That play, my friends, sums up the
Redskins’ running game all day long. Now Washington calls their last
time out.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Hey, the Dolphins do this as good as
anybody. See, in a four, three, two, two, you got the guards… boom!…
Plugging up the middle, then the corners… boom and</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: Third and twenty-two, but forget the
first down with eight seconds showing and the Skins down by a
touchdown.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Could be the last play.</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: Could be the last play of the season if
the players go out.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Take it all in, people. This could be it for
2,000.</p>
<p>****: Once again, if you haven’t heard, it was announced during
halftime that the N.F.L. Players Association will hold a press
conference immediately following this game – that would make it about
five o’clock Eastern time – and it is expected that</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: It’s all about money, folks. More money, of
course and ain’t it always? The shame of it is the big losers are you
out there, the fans.</p>
<p>****: Here we go: Third down, eight seconds to play, ball on the
Dolphins’ thirty-three yard line. Skins down by a touchdown.</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: Green 48! Green 48! Hut! Hut!</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: Well… Martel goes down ten yards short of
a score.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: On maybe the last play of the season.</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: I think he might have slipped.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Yeah, there’s a lot of that going
around.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We’re coming to your house tonight, and we’re
gonna fucking kill you! And if you got a dog, we’re gonna kill your
fucking dog too!</p>
<p><strong>augustine</strong>: Did they win or lose?!</p>
<p><strong>augustine</strong>: That has the distinct tonal quality of a
loss.</p>
<p><strong>augustine</strong>: Nice medicine for a loss. Keeps us calm.
Makes us not so sad. Keeps us on an even keel. Gives us some
perspective, doesn’t it? And we’ll save the winning medicine for next
Sunday, won’t we?</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: If you keep talking to me like I’m a five-
year-old, I’m going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>augustine</strong>: Sounds exciting.</p>
<p><strong>augustine</strong>: We’ll want to talk to coach now, won’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: What the fuck was that?!</p>
<p><strong>tildon</strong>: I think he slipped.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Bullshit he slipped! He could have
scored!</p>
<p><strong>tildon</strong>: Mister O’Neil, let’s face facts: The players
are going out. It’s gonna happen. And nobody wants to get hurt on the
last play before a strike that could go on for the rest of the
season.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: You god damn wimp! You’re fired! Get out!
Get out! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>augustine</strong>: Better? It always makes you feel better
when you fire someone, we know it does, don’t we? Yes…</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Get me Jimmy McGinty. Get him here.
Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Hey, man, I do what my</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: But you’re already one of the highest paid
players in the game. The fans just don’t see the point of a player like
you striking.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Let me tell you something: I’m a big man,
you see?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: There are some days when I am so beat up,
that I cannot dress my own big ass. I asked management for a valet or
some shit to help me dress and they said no way. So, fuck ’em!</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Shut up everybody, here it is…</p>
<p><strong>lindell</strong>: I have just left a meeting with
representatives of the owners and I am sad to say that they have refused
the players’ final demands which</p>
<p><strong>lindell</strong>: Therefore, I am recommending that all
N.F.L. players walk out and not play until our demands are met. I want
the players to walk out tall, to walk out righteous, to walk out in the
knowledge that we do this as a team. We shall overcome the fat cats. I
send peace to my union brothers.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Shit, I’m goin’ to Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: I’m dying, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Gimme a butt.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: You pussy. I want you to come back as head
coach. I fired that asshole Tilden today.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: We’re gonna finish the season anyway. All of
us owners decided. We’re gonna use replacement players.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Us, greedy?! What</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: No team owner in their right mind is gonna
give back those T.V. revenues.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: All we promised Fox was twenty-two guys with
a pulse every Sunday. But think about it, Jimmy. We got a great
opportunity here! We got a chance to put a team on the field that plays
the game just for the love of it. Like we used to play it.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Jimmy, I’m really dying. The doctor says
I’ll be gone by Superbowl Sunday. Help me bring a winner back to D.C.
You did it for me once before. You can do it again.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Come on. Wouldn’t it be fun? A bunch of poor
nobodies who play to win instead of a bunch of bitchy millionaires? You
can put it together, Jimmy. Player’s love you. They always have.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Tell me you’re gonna do it.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Sure, Jimmy, sure.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>pilachowski</strong>: … Six phone lines with internet access
on two: One for defense and one for offense.</p>
<p><strong>banes</strong>: We thought we would skip special teams for
the moment.</p>
<p><strong>pilachowski</strong>: Except for a kicker. We definitely need
a kicker. A place kicker over a punter.</p>
<p><strong>banes</strong>: The thinking being that if we lose the toss,
we have to be able to at least kick off.</p>
<p><strong>pilachowski</strong>: Okay. Here’s the list of every player
cut this past season. What we would like to do is…</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: You won’t need a center.</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Bored and ready to retire. I’m just looking
for one more hit. One more really good hit.</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Hell, I’m rich. I got no complaint with
Mister O’Neil. I just want a chance to play one last time.</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Shit, I’d rather go out with a broken leg
than sitting on the bench.</p>
<p><strong>biker</strong>: Did you hear something?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Jesus, Bateman! Why don’t you ever wait for
us?!</p>
<p><strong>biker #2</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What area code is 703?</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Washington, D.C.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Nice hands.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: A pack of Marlboro Reds, a pint of Martel
Cognac and a box of Trojans, extra long.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Get out of here. I’m telling your mother
you were talking like that.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hey, Clifford, somebody on the phone wants
you to play football next weekend.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Tell ’em I gotta work Saturday. And I’m
watching the Redskins on Sunday. Ain’t nothing stopping me from watching
the Redskins on Sunday. No way that’s gonna be</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: He’s gotta work. They said they’ll pay
you.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Pay me? How much?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: How much? Ten thousand five hundred
dollars!</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Ray, who the fuck is on the phone?!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: It’s the Washington Redskins!</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Get out of the way! Don’t look at him! He
don’t like being looked at, god damn it! No eye contact!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: And you look like that coach from the
Seventies. From the Redskins. McGinty. Except you look a shitload
older.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No, man, I’ve been out way too long.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You know what my nickname was in San Diego,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: As in, I hear ’em and I dump the ball.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I got two concussions to prove it.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Forty-five. And now you want to recruit
me?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay. What’s my</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’m retired from football.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I like being here. It’s quiet. I like being
alone.</p>
<p><strong>passerby #1</strong>: Deuce and an eightball on Go Down, Rita
in the eighth.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Louis, you got a phone call!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s the Washington Foreskins.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: What?! Ma, what are you, out a your tree?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I’m telling you they said it’s the</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Cut right on me, now. Right on me.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Not right on me, goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Coach Lamont! Phone call! Long distance.
Washington, D.C. It’s the Washington Redskins!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Thank you, Lord!</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Nice. Try a roll to the right.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Shane ‘Footsteps’ Falco? This is what you’re
going to build an offense around?</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Christ, Jimmy, I ask you to build me a team
based on balls and the first player I see is Footsteps Falco?!</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: And he’s got the happiest feet I’ve ever
seen!</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: What about a safety? We got two a days
starting tomorrow and a game in five days! And we still don’t have a
safety?!</p>
<p><strong>augustine</strong>: Here we go. Nice fat little hits.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: I called a friend of mine who just happens
to be the Governor of Maryland.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: As president of the Players’ Association,
what does your presence mean here, Mister Lindell?</p>
<p><strong>lindell</strong>: Very simply, support for these fine players
and union men. Washington D.C. is the home of freedom and the collective
bargaining agreement. I am here to remind all Americans that the owners
are no better than the robber barons of the Nineteenth Century. They
have blatantly gone out and hired scabs, which is against all principles
of our Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and probably
even the Emancipation Proclamation.</p>
<p><strong>lindell</strong>: And here come the Scabskins now!</p>
<p><strong>players</strong>: Scabskins! Scabskins! Scabskins!</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Oh God, there’s Eddie Martel! And Wilson
Jones! I love Wilson Jones! Yo, Wilson! Yo, player!</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Hey, Lou Pacifico.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Shane Falco.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I know. I lost a ton a money on that Sugar Bowl
disaster of yours. Wow. Did you get your butt kicked or what?</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: You know I don’t take that shit.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Be cool.</p>
<p><strong>players</strong>: Scabskins! Scabskins!</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: He told me he was a linebacker!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I can see.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Two. No, wait. Three.</p>
<p><strong>pilachowski</strong>: Oh my God. That’s disgusting!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Not bad, Coach.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>pilachowski</strong>: You’re not serious.</p>
<p><strong>banes</strong>: I got a defensive end who’s deaf!!</p>
<p><strong>pilachowski</strong>: walk I’ll trade you for a tackle who’s
gonna play in a diaper.</p>
<p><strong>banes</strong>: How can I coach a deaf man?!</p>
<p><strong>banes</strong>: I can’t believe it! I got to be able to
communicate with him.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Oh shit! No!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hi, I’m Danny.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Shane.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Thank’s, Coach!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’m very interested in that.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Annabelle Farrell, head Redskinette.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: I’m in charge. Of the Redskinettes. The
cheerleaders?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Oh yeah, hi.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: I’ve been watching you. You look good.
You look strong. Good quick release. Smart. You read defenses quickly.
You’re gonna do great.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hey… thanks.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: I saw your second concussion. The one</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: If there’s anything you need, let me
know. And I mean anything, okay? You understand?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Sure. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: They put you up at the Hilton?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Good. Remember: anything. You got it?
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I know, Coach, I know.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Oh yeah, Coach, sure. In a, you know,
romantic way.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Coach, wait! Can I still like touch my
girl friends if I don’t, you know, let go of the ball?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … just glad to be back playing. That’s all
I’ve really got to say.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: But where have you been? What have you
been doing to make a living?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Well… I’ve been involved lately in the…
aquatic business…</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: You only played one game?!</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Actually, less than two minutes. I was a
rookie third round pick in ’93. We were playing Atlanta in the home
opener. Near the end of the first quarter, they sent me in, I took a
screen pass over the middle and got hit by both linebackers.
Simultaneously. One a</p>
<p><strong>mickey</strong>: Can you play on it now?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: I’ve been teaching high school football for
five years. It’s not a bad life. I’m good at it. There are some days
when I actually love it. But for one more shot at this? Shit. I’d give
it all up. This time, they’re gonna have to take me out in a box.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: I got Wilson Boone’s locker, man. Do you
believe that shit?</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: Hey, you can’t park there.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Look, I don’t want any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: You don’t want any trouble?! You’re taking
my job away, but you don’t want any trouble? He doesn’t want any
trouble, but he puts this piece of shit in a no parking zone.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay. I’ll move it.</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: No, we’ll do that for you. Go ahead, Wilson.
Move it for him.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: You all put that car back.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: We’re the people who take care of the
quarterback. We’re the guards.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Put the car back. Gently.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Kiss my ass.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: No, it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: That’s your ride, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: My windshield! You crazy motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Move his car back.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: My car!</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: No! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: Come on, help me, god damn it!</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: You are gonna pay for this.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: No I’m not. And quit messing with my man
here. That includes his ride.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Let’s go to practice, Shane.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Let’s do that.</p>
<p><strong>assistant coach</strong>: … so if anyone does have any
firearms, we need to turn those in as soon as possible, no questions
asked…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Praise the Lord, Shane.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Walt Cochran. Offensive tackle.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Shane, will you witness with me?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Will I what?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Will you witness with me? For this upcoming
practice.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Praise the Lord for giving us a way to
eliminate, Shane. Why not talk to Him in the midst of performing his
gift?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Heavenly Father, thank you for allowing us
to pee the poisons from our systems. Please help us in today’s practice
to be strong and…</p>
<p><strong>banes</strong>: Where did you play, Judge? Wait. Do I call
you judge?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Your Honor, or Judge is fine. I played at
Harvard. But I played in the days when you went both ways. Offense and
defense. When players were really tough. And where did you play college
ball… I’m sorry, what was your name again?</p>
<p><strong>wilkinson</strong>: Smith. Ray Smith. I played at a junior
college nobody ever heard of. What position did you play on defense,
Judge?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Middle linebacker.</p>
<p><strong>wilkinson</strong>: Yeah, big fellow like you, that’s what I
would have guessed.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: It was a different game in those days. Raw.
Powerful. No tricks, like today.</p>
<p><strong>wilkinson</strong>: You know, maybe you can show me some of
your technique, Your Honor. Maybe you can show me some of that
toughness.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: I’d be glad to!</p>
<p>****: You would think he’s done enough.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: McGinty, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I was kind of thinking the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: My theory is he came out of retirement to
see if he could win with losers. Oh, shit. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hey, it’s okay. I’ve been called worse.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Like after that Sugar Bowl game? I guess
you could survive anything after that.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Sometimes I feel like everybody in the world
saw that game. Like I could go to India and some little guy would run up
to me and say, ’Boy, did you suck in</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: So, how come you’re such a fan?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: My dad. He’s a huge Redskin fan. For
years. He’s in his twenty-ninth year at the Senate Office Building. As a
guard, not a senator. The only thing that keeps him going he says, is me
and the Redskins. That’s where I get it. My fan-ness. Are you
scared?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Scared? Well… yes. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: It’s okay. Anybody would be. But you’re
good. And you’ll do good.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Well, thank you. Look, I gotta study the play
book tonight. So… I’ll see you.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Break a leg tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: It’s from the theater. For opening night.
You say the worst thing that can happen. And</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Alright, this is how we used to stop a
running back.</p>
<p><strong>wilkinson</strong>: I can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>wilkinson</strong>: Oooh… got me a judge! Man, that felt
good!</p>
<p><strong>lindell</strong>: Don’t be asking for no autographs from the
real players and then go in and watch the scabs!</p>
<p><strong>lindell</strong>: That is not the message we want to send our
children!</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Remember to nod your head on the snap.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Nod my head?</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: For when Murray’s in. The deaf kid. Hello? He
needs to look at you on the snap.</p>
<p><strong>pilachowski</strong>: What are you, crazy? Nobody eats right
before a game.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I always ate before a big match. I need the
bulk.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: … Pretty bold move by New England Patriot
owner Victor Kiam, who went out and bought an entire semi-pro team once
the strike happened.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Redskin management, on the other hand, is
going with a bunch of unknowns. Their public relations people don’t even
have bios yet on most of their players, although we’ll see one or two
familiar faces out there today.</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: Like Shane Falco, the enormously talented
college quarterback from Ohio State, who never fulfilled his potential
in the pro’s. Wow, remember that</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Oh, yeah, they were absolutely
decimated!</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: Dusted. And if I’m not mistaken, Falco
set a record in that game for Bowl interceptions. Anyway, for some of
these players this is another shot; a last shot, probably, for a guy
like Falco…</p>
<p>****: Ladies and gentlemen, your Washington Redskins!</p>
<p>****: Here’s the starting defense today…</p>
<p>****: At middle linebacker, number 56, Daniel Bateman!</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: Oh, my…</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Bastards.</p>
<p>****: And now… uh, the rest of the Washington Redskins.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: That’s where I stand.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: No it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Come on, man, that’s my spot in the
huddle.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: … Fat fucking nip! You don’t know shit!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: What did you call me?!</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: You heard me, you tub a rice shit!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hold on, what’s the problem here?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m gonna kick your black ass…</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: You ain’t kickin’ jack shit…</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Don’t be messing with my brother…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hey, hold on…</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: Delay of game! Five yards!</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: … I don’t know. Something seems to be
going on in the huddle. It looks like… yes, Shane Falco is on his back.
They haven’t run a play yet but Falco is down.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: This is not a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What happened? Am I hurt already?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: God damn it! I am the quarterback! I am the
only one supposed to talk in the huddle!</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Yeah, but he took my place…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I don’t give a shit!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Huddle up!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: If you’ve got something to say, raise your
hand! Is that understood?!</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: Suppose like, you don’t feel good. Or you’re
hurt or something like that. Then what?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Then you tell me before the huddle starts!
Okay, listen up: 68 blue east storm toss. On two.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: That’s to the right… right?</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: No, it’s to the left.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: It’s to the right!</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: You better be quiet, Shane, they’ll hear
you.</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: Delay of game! Five yards!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Well, Pat, so far the Redskins have minus
ten yards offensively.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Blue 68. Blue 68! Hut! Hut!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Have you suddenly decided you don’t like me,
Jamal?</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Oh. You said it was to the right, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay. Let’s try something simple. 18 red left
slot open. That’s to the left!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Eighteen red! Eighteen red! Hut! Hut!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: Holding! Number 78.</p>
<p><strong>cochran</strong>: You see. We should have prayed.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Shut up! Pass. 22 Solo right slot ‘A,’ Y
stick. On one.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Twenty-two green. Hut!</p>
<p>****: Washington comes up a minus fourteen yards on their first
possession.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Wide right! You got wide right! Check on the
wing!</p>
<p><strong>patriot qb</strong>: Blue fourteen!</p>
<p><strong>patriot qb</strong>: Green eighty-seven!</p>
<p>****: I think the Redskins just set a record for penalties in the
first three minutes. We’re waiting for the stats on that…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I don’t feel good.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>cochran</strong>: Oooooh…</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: Man, that’s ripe!</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Shane, we got to move!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay. On the count of three. Everyone more
left. Hut! Hut! Hut!</p>
<p><strong>patriot lb</strong>: What the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: John, how many years have we been calling
games together?</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Seventeen, I think.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: U brown right, west 19 A lead. That’s you,
Mickey. Puke on him if you have to.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hut!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Very nice off tackle run by Lamont.
Execution was letter perfect.</p>
<p>****: That puts the Redskins in field goal range. And here comes
Pacifico to see if he can get them on the board before the half
ends.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: This will be a forty- five yarder. That’s
a</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hut!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: We can’t put three plays together without a
penalty, a fumble of a fight.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You’re good. You’re really good.</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: Another terrific interception by Smith.
That’s his second.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Yeah, this guy is a player.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: According to the Redskins, Ray Smith… is…
that’s weird. No college given, no high school given. It just says he’s
been a resident of the state of Maryland for the last four years and
five months. Likes to embroider.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay, let’s all take a few seconds to think
about what we were doing for a living… just last week.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Good. Let’s kick ass. Red right pass 15 x</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Red fifteen! Red fifteen! Hut!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: … began with a Redskin end around, but
Cochran, the pulling tackle ran into Falco’s pitchout … see?</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Right here, it bounced off his helmet. Then
it was kicked by Landon and then Hayes touched it, I think, and then
Green got a hand on it, and then Bellinski recovered it and then he lost
it, and finally the ball took a crazy bounce right back into</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hut, hut!</p>
<p>****: Falco is intercepted. That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Yeah, and it looks like he’s hurt, too. He
was really starting to put it together here in the fourth quarter. Only
forty-eight seconds now left on the clock.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: The ball. Okay, Coach.</p>
<p><strong>patriot qb</strong>: Hut, hut, hut!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I can’t…</p>
<p>****: Here comes Falco with eighteen seconds left on the clock.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: I’m surprised to see him again after that
shot he took from Bellinski.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: 22 green!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Check! Black 43! Black 43!</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: He’s changing the play. Listen!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Black 43!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: It’s a long count. Falco could be calling an
audible.</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: Is this right?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Black 43 left!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hut! Hut!</p>
<p>****: Lamont scores!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Whoa! Falco calls an audible at the line of
scrimmage and Lamont takes it in!</p>
<p>****: With eight seconds remaining, Pacifico will try the extra point
that will send this game into overtime.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: This turned out to be one hell of a contest,
Pat!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hut!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: It’s a fake!</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: We won, Shane. We won!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … ultimately, it’s a pain thing, you know? I
mean, it’s Darwinian, the survival of the numbest. Whoever can take the
pain most, gets the largest contract. It’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>in red</strong>: Exactly. Let me buy you another.</p>
<p><strong>woman in red</strong>: I don’t know how you do it. I hate
pain. Pain is a no no as far as I’m concerned.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’m glad that you are concerned.</p>
<p><strong>woman in red</strong>: Hey, are you alright? I’ll take you up
to your room, if you like.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I would like.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Here’s home.</p>
<p><strong>woman in red</strong>: A friend of mine is going to join us,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>woman in blue</strong>: Hi. Ready to party?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Oooooh. Bookends.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Go away. Both of you.</p>
<p><strong>woman in red</strong>: Fuck off!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: These are my guests.</p>
<p><strong>woman in red</strong>: You crazy bitch!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: You were about to be rolled.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: That’s what I was hoping.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: They work the bar downstairs looking for
drunk Redskins.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I guess they found one.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Don’t feel so bad. It’s a rookie
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Here. Take this.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: It’s for the pain. Take it. It’s only a
little bit illegal.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Oh, God. I’ve got to go to the bathroom. It’s
far away, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: I’ll help. We’ll just take our time.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Kidneys.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Oh, man. My hair hurts.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: You took a hell of a beating. The
martinis didn’t help, either.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Don’t be afraid if you’ve got blood in
your urine. That’s normal.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Did you undress me?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: And you… slept here with me?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Did we… ?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Are you kidding? You were catatonic.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No blood.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Good. Back to bed.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: May I ask you a personal question?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Do you do this for all Redskin
quarterbacks?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Then why me?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: I don’t know. I guess I can’t resist a
man who can take a hit.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I can’t take a hit!</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Shhh. It’s all in your head. Now, get
some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: You’re the golden boy in the press this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: ‘Falco scores big.’ Well… not really.
Hey, a lot of the regular players are starting to cross the picket
line.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Redskins?</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: It doesn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: McGinty called a dinner meeting with the
whole team.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Thank you. Thanks for… everything. You saved
my life.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: No. Probably just your wallet and your
watch.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: And that pill, that sure worked.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: You’re basic double D Vicodin. But be
careful: It’s habit- forming. The best stuff always is.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Ice both knees and that shoulder before
bed.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: I’ll give you 50 thousand dollars for a bite
of that steak!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Coach, what will be your strategy against
New York this Sunday?</p>
<p>****: … The Palm patrons showed an impromptu appreciation tonight for
the new Washington Redskins. They may be unknowns and far from
superstars, but it sure looks like they have charmed the fans.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hi. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: We don’t travel with the team. So, here’s
Tylenol with codeine, regular Vicodins, the magic bullet one that I gave
you before, and a couple of Darvons if you actually break something. Pop
’em in the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Wow. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: I’ll be watching on TV. The Giants got
back three of their four defensive linemen.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Yeah. I know.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: What can I say? Go from the shotgun and
scramble your ass off.</p>
<p><strong>morris</strong>: Hello, again!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: That’s all-pro Hank Morris’s third sack, his
second here in the fourth quarter and the sixth of the day for</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: If he can stay alive that long. Ten-three
New York in what has turned out to be an incredible defensive duel.</p>
<p><strong>lindell</strong>: … because it’s about brothers, and
brotherhood and standing together against the oppressors. That’s why I
am so grateful to our Teamster brothers who have joined us here today in
New York to protest the greed squad known as the N.F.L. owners.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You got to double up on Morris.</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: He’s too far outside for me to get to him.
Bring him down and sit on him.</p>
<p><strong>cochran</strong>: He’s huge! He’s been beating the crap out
of me all day! I feel like a rag doll out here.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’ll help this time.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay. Spread left ‘A’ Right, roll right Half
Back Sail. On two.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Red, fifteen. Hut, hut!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Huddle up!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Same thing… Except… Let him in. Don’t touch
him.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Shane…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Shut up! Let him through. On two.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Red fifteen. Hut!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Get him!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Morris intercepts! Wait! The ball is stuck
in his face!</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Now that’s a hit!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Lee scores! Lee scores! Lee scores! I love
to see a fat guy score!</p>
<p><strong>time remaining</strong>: 58 seconds.”</p>
<p><strong>pacifico</strong>: What a hit! What a hit!</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: I’m proud of you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: You’re the one, you’re the one, you’re the
one…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You think that’s worth a shoe deal?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No! Danny, go down! You’re using up the
clock!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Time out!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Beautiful tackle, Shane!</p>
<p>****: Now that’s something you don’t see everyday!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: We got time for one play, but if we don’t get
it out of bounds, the game is over.</p>
<p><strong>pacifico</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>pacifico</strong>: You hold it. I’ll kick it.</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: I can’t believe it! McGinty is gonna let
Pacifico try the field goal from sixty-five yards out!</p>
<p><strong>summerall</strong>: Hey, John, this kid has got a heck of a
foot.</p>
<p><strong>stram</strong>: But sixty-five yards? Come on!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Pat… did he just? I think that guy is
smoking on the field!</p>
<p>****: No, I think you imagined that one, John.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You look great, Lou, you know that?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Really? Thanks, Shane. That means a lot to
me.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hut!</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: It’s straight enough! If it’s got the
distance, it’s…</p>
<p><strong>madden</strong>: Good! Redskins win!</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: You’re getting used to being slapped
around. That’s a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Would you like to come in and make
love?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Yes. No. I’m here because … I don’t want to
be alone.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Most of the world feels that way. You
don’t have to be embarrassed about it.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: But to tell you the truth… I’m kind of scared
of you.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: I won’t hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: That shoulder is going to need special
handling.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You know what hurts</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: I can’t imagine.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Their defensive end punched me in the
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Seriously. It’s killing me.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: … after that game, after being beaten that
badly in front of the whole country, after humiliating myself, my team,
my school, my family, I mean – did you know that I set two Sugar Bowl
records?! I was sacked eleven times! I threw six interceptions!</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Okay. Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Anyway, after that, I could never seem to
adjust in the pros. I was too scared. I lost my balls.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Well, they’re back.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You know what I mean. My nerve. I lost the
edge you need to play this game.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: I don’t believe that. I don’t think it
just goes away. It was only one bad day, Shane. Everybody has those.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No. Somehow, I convinced myself that I
couldn’t ever win the big game. I got so down, that I was afraid to be
playing when a game was on the line. I was afraid to screw up. That’s
the sure sign of a loser. From there, it wasn’t very far to thinking
that I’ll never win, that I didn’t deserve to win at anything. Including
love.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: You’re wrong. You’re winning now. You’re
winning me.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: … the All Pro Miami Safety who was serving
five to seven years in the Maryland state penitentiary for three counts
of aggravated assault. As you may recall, one of those counts was
against a Baltimore City police officer and resulted in that officer
being hospitalized for quite some time.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: Any idea how Wilkinson’s identity was
discovered and who leaked it to the media?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: No, Bob, but rumor has it that the
National Football League Player’s Association had something to do with
it.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: Thanks, Hank.</p>
<p>****: In other N.F.L. news, almost sixty percent of the regular
players have now crossed the picket lines and more are crossing every
day. The strike, now in its second week, is expected to go out with a
fizzle. Most experts think that the Monday night Dallas/Washington game
will be the last with replacement players. But even that game will
feature at least 75 percent of the regular Cowboys. Coach James McGinty
will try to make it a perfect three and O with a team made up totally of
replacement players. Well… and one felon. That we know of.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Where are we gonna keep him?</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: How did you pull that off?</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Take this cow piss out of here.</p>
<p><strong>augustine</strong>: You used to love asparagus soup. They say
that when the taste buds go, you’re at the beginning of the end.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Let’s keep ’em all. The hell with the
regulars.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: The hell I do! I’m dying! Let ’em sue
me.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: God damn ’em! Then you got to beat Dallas.
The whole country will be watching. All those millionaires down there
deserve to have their noses rubbed in it.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: You can pull it off. You proved that winning
doesn’t have to look pretty. These boys are hungry for it, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: There’s nothin’ more dangerous in all of
sports than a hungry team. I remember back in ’47, we were playing
Nebraska in the mud…</p>
<p><strong>o’neil</strong>: Okay, Jimmy, okay. But you beat Dallas for
me, and then I’ll go gently into that night.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You’ll score, too, with a Cadillac from Coleman
Cadillac. It’s a big car for a big man.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You’ll score, too, with a Cadillac from
Coleman’s Cadillac. It’s a big car for a big man.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: That’s good, Mickey, that’s real good.
Let’s try it again.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: You’ll score, too, with a Cadillac from Coleman
Cadillac. It’s a big car, for a big man.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Okay. Good. That was good. Let’s try it
again…</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: What?! I’m not doing it again! Who are you,
Orson Welles?! This is nuts!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: This is a visit.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: A visit. Who let you in?</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: I used to nail one of the housekeepers.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Lucky girl.</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: You know who these guys are, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Dallas Cowboys. Howdy.</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: You’ll be seeing a lot of these guys
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: Who, me? Not much. But these boys wanted a
little head start on you.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’m flattered that you actually think we have
a chance to win.</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: It can be a game of luck. And under no
circumstances can we allow a scab team to go three and O. Especially
against the Dallas Cowboys. It’s just not good for the</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Is the union behind this ‘visit’?</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: I can’t really say, Shane. By the way, have
you ever tried throwing a football with bruised ribs?</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: The pain makes it damn near impossible.</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: And one other thing: I want you to stay away
from Annabelle.</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: The sad fact is she won’t give me the time
of day. But you can’t have everything I want. I can’t let that happen.
So, you gotta stop seeing her. Just on principle.</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: Let me hear you say it.</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: Come on. You can do it.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I won’t go out with her</p>
<p><strong>martel</strong>: Good. Gentlemen? Hey, have a great game!</p>
<p><strong>lindell</strong>: I think that Mister Matheson here, and
myself, are very close to an agreement that will put the ‘pro’ back in
pro-football.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mister Matheson, what are the sticking
points in the negotiations as far as the owners are concerned?</p>
<p><strong>matheson</strong>: Only one: that the players immediately go
back to work with no change in the existing contract.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Good evening from the Big O here in Washington
D.C. where the mighty Dallas Cowboys take on the Cinderella Washington
‘Scabskins’ as they have come to be known. Hi, I’m Al Michaels and we
are witnesses to a unique matchup tonight as Shane Falco and a
contingent of strike players go up against the entire regular squad of
the Dallas Cowboys. Yes, you heard right: every Cowboy has now crossed
the picket line, some as late as this afternoon, and they will all play
tonight. Can a rag tag group of hasbeens and castoffs stand up to what
was once called America’s team? And what about the strike itself? It has
been so ineffective that many predict it will be over before this game
ends. Stay tuned as Boomer and Dan join me for strike ball, D.C.
style.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Whatever you say, Coach.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: That is one very big leg on Lou Pacifico. He’s a
big reason why this strike team is two and 0.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: But the fact is, a kicker does not an offense
make. I think tonight the Scabskins will have a very rude awakening.</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: But you have to admit, Dan, Falco is proving
to be the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Well, Boomer, no, I don’t have to admit
anything.</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: Here we go…</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Shane!</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hut! Hut!</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: I’m gonna autograph your body with bruises,
you scab-ass son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Like Christmas morning.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: What pursuit! Butler never gave up on him.
That’s a 270-pound guy who moves like a halfback.</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: Dan, I think Butler’s hit on Falco was late,
to tell you the truth.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Well, of course you do. You were a wimp
quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Easy, guys.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay. Red right 15 X hook.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: 15 X hut!</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: Shane!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: That’s the end of the</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Al, the battle is being fought and won in the
trenches. You can’t expect a bunch of pick- up players to stand up to a
professional pass rush like the Cowboys.</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: There’s still a whole half left, Dan. And
remember, Falco is proving to be a second- half quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You got to be kidding.</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: Those big, fat boys in the trenches get
awful tired. You ought to know that, Dan.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Okay, let’s join Chris Berman with our half-
time show. Chris?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Clear!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: What’s wrong with you guys?!</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: He started it.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I did not! You called me fat!</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: I did not! But you are!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’m sorry, Roland. That was a great
block.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: For my last play in football, I’ll take that
block.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: I thought you were going to score. What
happened? Did you slip?</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You were a warrior, Roland. I’m gonna miss
you.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: It was a dream come true. Go kick some ass
for me.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Hey, Shane, I just heard. Congratulations!</p>
<p><strong>wilkinson</strong>: Congratulations on what?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Shane is staying on. He’s gonna be Martel’s
backup.</p>
<p><strong>andre</strong>: Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Yes, Andre. It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I got to tell you, Shane, you played the
first half like you were staying. Like you already had a contract.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: You’re right, Clifford. And I’m sorry. But
now I want to go out there and either beat these bastards or die trying.
I never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know what yawl are doin’ tomorrow, but
my ass is goin’ back to jail. But if I gotta go, I want to go back a
winner.</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Hell, I’m retiring. I have thirty minutes of
football left in my whole career. I’m homicidal!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Me, too, Reese!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Let’s get it on!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Gentlemen, our problem is the Cowboys aren’t
afraid of us. But they should be!</p>
<p><strong>lamont</strong>: Damn straight!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: We’ve got one chance on offense to make our
stand – the first play of the half.</p>
<p><strong>jamal</strong>: One touchdown ain’t gonna help, Shane.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No. But one nasty-ass play might. We just
gotta be brave. And trust each other.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Help me with this.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Somebody has to tape me up.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: … at nine-forty Eastern time, the agreement was
reached, and except for this upcoming second half, the strike is
history.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: It’s about time. I say let the professionals
back on the field. The fans deserve nothing less.</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: Yeah, you would say that.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: Are you okay? Is it your side?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’m okay. I owe you an apology.</p>
<p><strong>annabelle</strong>: What? You do?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Yes. I’ll explain later. But thank you for
believing in me. You give me strength just looking at you.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Well, this is a first. Shane Falco seems to
be…</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: Hell, Al, he’s necking with a cheerleader!
I’ve done a little of that in my time.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: The players are not supposed to fraternize with
the cheerleaders.</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: Hey, Dan, what are they</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: That wasn’t too smart.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Suck my dick.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Here we go, first and ten for the Redskins.
Twenty-four zip Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>linebacker</strong>: Are you ready for more</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Blue thirteen! Blue thirteen! Hut! Hut!
Hut!</p>
<p><strong>defender</strong>: He’s got a knife!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Whoa! Flags fly everywhere! I’ve never seen
anything like this!</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: Unbelievable! One Washington player had a
Cowboy in what appeared to be a police choke hold.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I see at least five flags… no six!</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: He scratched my eyes out!</p>
<p><strong>linebacker</strong>: He hit me on purpose!</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: Unsportsmanlike conduct, number 72, number 81
and number 87 on the offense, fifteen yards… … times three… that’s
forty-five yards. Illegal use of hands, number 48 on the offense,
fifteen yards. That makes it sixty yards. Unnecessary roughness number
65 and number 32, fifteen yards… that’s, wait… forty-five… no, thirty…
another … how many yards so far?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Okay, everybody, stick</p>
<p><strong>butler</strong>: I can’t believe you went for my eyes!</p>
<p><strong>cochran</strong>: Shut up! I’m gonna do it again ’cause it
was fun!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Black 98! Black 98! Hut!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: First and ten at the Cowboy twenty and I’m
telling you, we are looking at a totally different team here in the
second half.</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: Absolutely, Al. The Redskins are playing
like there’s no tomorrow, because, hey, there isn’t!</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: I gotta agree with you on this one. The
surprising thing for me is how ineffectual the Cowboys have been in this
half. I mean, they look totally intimidated.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: I love when you guys agree.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hut! Hut!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Touchdown, Skins! What a fluke!</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: Total luck there, Al. Makes up for the
perfect ones they drop.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Maybe not so lucky. Falco is down.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Put your tits on my head…</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: … one minute twenty remaining, and even though
Dallas didn’t score, they sure ate up a lot of the clock.</p>
<p><strong>boomer</strong>: And it looks like Falco cannot answer the
bell. He’s still on the bench</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: They just need to get the ball in field goal
range.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: And for Pacifico, that’s anything up to
sixty-five yards.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: That’s good for twelve yards. The clock stops on
the first down. The Redskins have no time- outs left.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I can do it.</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Wilkinson throws it away, and with twelve
seconds remaining, the Redskins will try a forty-eight yard field goal
to tie it up. That’s almost a chip shot for Pacifico.</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Just make it a good snap. And you’ll do the
rest, right?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Lou, are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>pacifico</strong>: I’m sorry. They know where my family
lives.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: Come on, Shane!</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Hut!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: It’s a fake! Falco has it!</p>
<p><strong>al</strong>: Falco scores!</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: Clipping. Number 77 offense.</p>
<p><strong>pacifico</strong>: I broke my arm. Thank you. You saved my
ass.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: What would Unitas do in this situation? I
have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>lee</strong>: I’m so sorry, Shane. I’m sorry, everybody.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: No problem, Mickey. Hell of a hit, Reese.</p>
<p><strong>evans</strong>: That’s the one I was looking for. I can
retire in peace now.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Right after this play. So besides me, who
really wants the ball?</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Yeah. You want it, Brian. Let’s hook up. says
Blue left slot open ‘A’ right. Two Jet ‘X’ drive. On three. Gentlemen,
it’s been an honor sharing the field of battle.</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Blue 58! Blue 58! Hut! Hut! Hut!</p>
