<h1 id="the-blast-from-the-past">the-blast-from-the-past</h1>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: For Pete’s sake, Calvin! We’ve got
guests!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Sorry, honey! I just got to fooling with
this darn rheostat.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, put it down and come in!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You bet, hon!</p>
<p>****: Tower, Wolf One is five miles from the overhead.</p>
<p><strong>tower</strong>: Wolf One, Tower. Report the numbers. You’re
number one for the overhead.</p>
<p>****: Wolf one.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Tower. Wolf One. I’ve got a problem here.</p>
<p><strong>tower</strong>: Say your problem, Wolf One. Are you declaring
an emergency?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Stand by. One.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Just remember: don’t mention the
communists!</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Calvin’s a great guy, but he’s a little, you
know…</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Nutty.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: What’s his wife like?</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Oh, you know, housewife.</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: Likes to cook. Pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Normal, then.</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Well, I wouldn’t go that far. Helen!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hi, Betty! Dave!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: Just look at you!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Any day now!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: This is my sister and her husband.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, hi! Welcome!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: So anyhow this duck says to the clerk, “I’d
like to buy this lip balm.” And the clerk says, “Will that be cash or a
check?” And the duck says, “Just put it on my bill!”</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: He was the golden-boy professor at Cal Tech.
But then he starts inventing things.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: What kind of things?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: You got me. Some kind of special synthetic
rubber. And some kind of automated machine. Anyhow, suddenly he gets
rich. I mean rich! And quits teaching.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>guest</strong>: Just what the doctor ordered!</p>
<p><strong>betty</strong>: With all his money they could have moved to
Beverly Hills, but they decided to stay in the Valley. Calvin spends all
his time tinkering out there in his workshop. If you ask me it’s all
very strange.</p>
<p><strong>woman guest #1</strong>: He dug a huge hole out there for a
swimming pool. Then he decided he didn’t want it and filled the thing
in. And what’s that big, high fence for?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: There currently exists a type of neon light
that lasts five years. But you won’t see it on the market. Same is true
of batteries. I could take your simple yacht battery and rig it to last
a decade, easily.</p>
<p><strong>harold</strong>: Well, what the heck kind of a marketing
system can’t get great new products like that out to the public?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: A veeeery good one, Harold. Free market
capitalism may not be a perfect order, but it’s the best we’ve got, or
will ever have. And why? Three reasons!</p>
<p><strong>woman guest #2</strong>: Say, Helen? What does Calvin think
about this trouble down in Cuba?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, please don’t bring that up!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I’d say my baseball card collection is as
complete as any one I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>ron</strong>: Calvin! Hey, Calvin! Kennedy’s going toe-to-toe
with Khrushchev on the television!</p>
<p><strong>jfk</strong>: …this sudden, clandestine decision to station
strategic weapons for the first time outside of Soviet soil, is a
deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which
cannot be accepted by this country.</p>
<p><strong>tower</strong>: Wolf One – say intentions.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I’ve got secondaries of an engine fire and
I’ll need to find a clear area to eject.</p>
<p><strong>tower</strong>: Roger, Wolf One. Can you make it to the
ocean?</p>
<p><strong>jfk</strong>: …we will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk
the cost of worldwide nuclear war, in which even the fruits of victory
would be ashes in our mouth. But neither will we shrink from the risk at
any time it must be faced.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I’m sorry everyone, but given this
extraordinary turn of events, I think it’s prudent that we cut the
evening short. I’m sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the
meantime…I’d suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We’ll do this again! Maybe next week. Here’s
your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?</p>
<p><strong>dave</strong>: What’d I tell ya?!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Time? Oh, no Calvin. It’s not time yet. I
still have–</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: On the contrary, I think we’re the only ones
who are.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Calvin I’m sure everything’s going to be all
right. I just know it is!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, I’m certainly not going to let the pot
roast go to waste. Could you just put that seat cover back on that lawn
chair?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: It shuts off automatically.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Did you rig it to do that? You’re so
clever.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No. They all do.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I never know anymore.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I bet that’s a fighter jet on his way to Key
West! Good luck, amigo!</p>
<p><strong>tower</strong>: An emergency has been declared. I repeat, an
emergency has been declared.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You hear that?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: We can listen to the rest downstairs!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me
do the dishes. It’s not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on
food off my nice plates.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I just hope those plates aren’t radioactive
by tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Cheese is particularly troublesome.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that
Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Okay. Give me the roast and
watch your step. I’ll come back for the radio.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Tower, say again!!</p>
<p><strong>tower</strong>: The SAR HELO is airborne with you in
sight.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I’m marking the 180 radial for five and
ejecting.</p>
<p><strong>tower</strong>: Roger, Wolf One.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: How long will we have to stay down here?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I don’t know. For this thing to blow over,
it could take days.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Days??</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Rather safe than sorry. That’s my motto!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: But, what if I go into labor? That could
happen any time.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I’ve read up on it. I’ll deliver the baby
myself if I have to.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this
baby comes, you’re going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself
to death with all the other fathers.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yes, dear!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: As long as we’ve got that straight.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Home sweet home!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: To you maybe.</p>
<p><strong>ladder, corrugated tube, roof, and lots or dirt and
rock</strong>: BEGIN TO CRASH DOWN INTO THE ANTEROOM. Calvin struggles
to his feet and gets the vault door shut just in the nick of time.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What was that?!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Are you all right?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh, no! It’s happened! Look at that heat!!
All my surface indicators are knocked out! Oh, my Lord…it’s actually
happened!!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What’s that noise?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: The locks.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: The locks?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: To keep us from trying to leave. After an
atomic blast there’s a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five
years.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Thirty -five years!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Then after that it’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s safe.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: To go up.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: To go up.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hey, honey. Don’t you worry. We’re going to
be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>levy</strong>: According to Caltech, this Webber guy was a
bonafide genius and a borderline nutcase.</p>
<p><strong>atkinson</strong>: Well, he and Mrs. Nutcase must have been
out here when the plane hit.</p>
<p><strong>levy</strong>: Unless we get a postcard or somethin’, that’s
my guess.</p>
<p><strong>atkinson</strong>: What about relatives?</p>
<p><strong>levy</strong>: All back East.</p>
<p><strong>atkinson</strong>: The neighbors over there said the guy
spent day and night out here. She’d bring him sandwiches and hot
Dr. Pepper.</p>
<p><strong>levy</strong>: He drank it hot?</p>
<p><strong>atkinson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>levy</strong>: Good god.</p>
<p><strong>atkinson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hi, honey! Feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for
ourselves, for the child.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: All our friends…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Burnt to a crisp. I’ve given you the most
well-done cut.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, Calvin, you’re favorite.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: A bit chilly? Shouldn’t be. Temperature’s a
nice 73 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Maybe I’ve just got the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: How could you?! This is just like home!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe
me!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Would you like a tranquilizer?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You have tranquilizers?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I told you! I’ve got everything!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, no.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Uh, oh. Now it’s time.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Honey?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: The first child to be born on earth after
the annihilation!!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, Calvin. Babies cry.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I’ve noticed.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What shall we call him?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No. I think it’s just right.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And I was wondering…if…if I could have a…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: If I…you know…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What? Whatever you want, Helen!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I want a bedroom ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You’ve got it!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Calvin?!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Right here!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We looked all over for you. What are you
doing back here?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh, I was just examining this rear
hatchway.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No reason. Well, it’s pretty clear that the
front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the
time is up, we’ll have to return to the surface using, you know, this
back entrance. Which is very nice because it has the service
elevator!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yes. Well… yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Watch this!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Go to Daddy, Adam. Go to Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>workman #1</strong>: Hey, Boss!</p>
<p><strong>workman #1</strong>: What do you make of this?</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Damn if I know.</p>
<p><strong>workman #2</strong>: I bet it’s some kinda septic tank.</p>
<p><strong>workman #1</strong>: I’ve never seen a septic tank that
looked like that.</p>
<p><strong>boss</strong>: Well, don’t fool with it. If it is a septic
tank, I sure as hell don’t want to open it. We’ll just lay the
foundation over it.</p>
<p><strong>workman #1</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: …and since it’s almost certain that the
Webbers were killed, the bank is selling the house and that back parcel
over there that’s been re-zoned commercial. It’s right there on the
avenue.</p>
<p><strong>woman buyer</strong>: Is that where the plane crashed?</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: Yep, right there.</p>
<p><strong>man buyer</strong>: This place gives me the willies.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: Yeah, I know what you mean. But the price
is right.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Al ice in won der lan.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Not bad for a three and a half year old! I’d
like to see the public school system match that! I don’t care how
terrific it is!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, he’s very bright, dear. Much like his
father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he’s a little…young for school.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Nonsense. People have no idea what the human
mind is capable of. Look at us!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Look, Daddy. Alice went down a hole, just like
us.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yes, you certainly will. And you’ll find a
nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, Calvin, I’m not sure we should be making
promises that perhaps can’t be kept.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I believe there will be other survivors. In
fact, I’m guessing there’s life on the surface, even now. It’s not life
worth living perhaps, but believe me, something’s moving around up
there. And I don’t just mean the cockroaches.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’m going to need two more banana- splits and a
cherry coke!</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: You bet, Mom! Coming up!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Nothing in the world is more fun than
learning new things.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I can’t tell the boys from the girls
anymore!</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Uh…yeah. It’s like hard.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Boys! Excuse me, but I believe it’s my turn.
Adam?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I miss those nice flower-power kids. How ’bout
you?</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Um…uh…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: What the hell kind of music is that?!</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Oh, man. I’m like not sure I like
that.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: This is what money looks like. It comes like
this, in coin, or like this in paper. Or you can have an “investment.”
These are stock “certificates” that we bought in your name. Of course,
they’re worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: They’re pretty. Can I have them?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Sure. Now, let’s move on to our French
exam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Latin exam, Dad. It’s Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You’re right! It’s Tuesday already! By gosh,
time flies, doesn’t it?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Tempus fugit!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps
roul�!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Gerade aus dann links!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack
sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You know, you have a wonderful sense of
humor, son! I must say, the acorn doesn’t fall very far from the tree.
By the way, it’s time I gave you something. Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hi, honey!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: These are wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: It’s my entire baseball collection. It’s
yours now.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What’s baseball?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: It’s a game, son. I can explain it pretty
easily. There’s a pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Like a painting?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No, son. A pitcher.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Like one of Mom’s?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Uh, no. There’s a man who throws the ball –
to a man who has a bat.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The nocturnal flying mammal?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’m selling this place. I want out of this hell
hole!</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Could I, like…oh, wow…like,uh…</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Buy it from me?</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Yeah! Yeah, that’s it!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I’ll give it to ya, no money down. The
neighborhood has gone to hell anyway.</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No, no! The runner on second goes to third!
He’s out there!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Because he’s forced out at third! It’s a
force!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Then why go there?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Because he must!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Calvin!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Coming!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Get the presents and do the lights.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Blow out the candles!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Make a wish!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, boy! A jacket!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Your mom made that all by herself.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No kidding!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No kidding. Who else would have done it?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: And I made these!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I
think this new design will work even better!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: These are really swell! I mean swell!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What did you wish for, Adam?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: If he tells, it won’t come true!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, that’s just a bunch of baloney! We never
believed that in my family!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well, we did in my family!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I wished I could meet a girl.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh. A nice one, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: One who doesn’t glow in the dark.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well, we’ll be going up in two years. We’ll
know then. I’m very hopeful.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Let’s eat our cake.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yeah. Let’s dig in!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Elbows, Son.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sorry, Mom!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You never know. You may someday dine at the
White House with the president.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: If we still have one.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You know, when we do go up…I’m going to miss
this old place. How ’bout you, hon?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Would you excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: In the generator room again?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all these
things work.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I know exactly what you mean! Hey,
honey?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So…we just open this door and go up?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Um…is that supposed to happen?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey, where are we going?! Is everything all
right?!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Should we say a little prayer first?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Just open the door.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well, do we just go on up?!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No, son! We wait for night. Now…is precisely
when… we must be at our… most cautious.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: definitely tired of his</p>
<p>****: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Helen-Thomas-Webber! Maybe we have been down
here a little too long! Please excuse her French.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Shit is a French word?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, yes it is!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: It’s an archaic colloquialism, roughly
meaning…“good”.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes! That’s right!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh. Well…then…shit!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: C’est bon, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Merci!</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: …all of these things…Alcoholics
Anonymous…Cocaine Anonymous…Heroin Anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>other bum</strong>: There’s a Heroin Anonymous?</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Shut up! All of these things… ask you to
believe in a power greater than yourself! Some sort of God on High!
Well…I have lifted my eyes skyward a time or two… and I have certainly
not seen anything coming from up there except a goddamn airplane – that
I can’t afford to get on!</p>
<p><strong>other bum</strong>: Earthquake! Another earthquake!</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Let her come! Let’s get this over with!
And please, if there is a God, let it be worse in Bel Air!!</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Oh, God! Oh, God!! Oh,God, save me!! For
I have seen the light!!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I come in peace!!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: My, gosh…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Where is my backyard?</p>
<p><strong>street walker</strong>: You got a light, honey?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What?! A light! Yes, I’ve got a light!</p>
<p><strong>street walker</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: So…you…survived the blast, did you?</p>
<p><strong>street walker</strong>: The blast? Honey, I have survived a
host of things. Like the song says: “A country boy can survive!”</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yes, yes, the song. So tell me…has it
been…hell up here?</p>
<p><strong>street walker</strong>: “Hell up here?” Honey, it’s been hell
up here, down there and over yonder! Hell everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yes, I can tell that just looking around.
“Boy?” Did you say you were a “country boy?”</p>
<p><strong>street walker</strong>: Cute Little Old Man, if you want a
boy, I can be a boy. And if you want a girl, I can be a girl. I can be
anything you want me to be!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>street walker</strong>: Uh-huh. And it’s all yours for the
remarkably low price of only $200! And if you act now, I might even
throw in some free lawn furniture.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No, I can’t. I’m sorry! I have to go! I have
to…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hello! How are you this evening?! Mind if I,
you know, browse around?!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Thank-Q very much!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I’m going to give it to you straight.
There’s no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors.
Apparently, the fallout has created….a subspecies of mutants.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Mutants?!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: It’s not a pretty sight. Some eat out of
garbage cans. Others are…cover your ears, Son, and hum. I mean that
literally and I mean right now!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Others are…multi-sexual. It seems…they can
be both masculine and feminine…simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t believe it!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Believe it. He tried to sell me his body,
Helen. They offer lawn furniture as a come on!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: They’ve done a lot of re-building but
society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up
in the streets. Others point guns. There’s something terribly wrong with
the automobiles and…and I…I can’t tell you the rest. I just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we
do now?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: We stay down here.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: We do?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: For how long? We’ve just about run out of
everything!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: We’ll make do. I’m of the opinion that these
mutants will eventually kill each other off and then–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, Calvin. We’re not going to make do. Not
me! Not Adam. We’re going up no matter what! We deserve it. Even if it’s
terrible!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well, I am the head of this household–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I want him to at least see the sky!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: –and we will–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: And the ocean! A mountain range!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: –do as I say!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, no! Oh, my goodness! Let’s get him into
the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: He seems to be doing all right now. I don’t
know if he’s had a heart attack or just… a horrifying experience. But we
need supplies and I’ve got to stay with him.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ll go up.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m afraid you’ve got to.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: You’re my brave boy.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Just act normal. If anybody asks, simply say
you’re from out-of-town, and that you’re in town on business. Write that
down.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I don’t know how far you’ll have to travel to
find supplies, but if you can’t get home by nightfall, I want you to
look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It’s a hotel.
There might still be one standing.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Let’s get you packed.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I just hope this is still good up there.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I was thinking that, uh…you know, while I was
up there and all…that maybe I could, you know…try to meet a girl. I’ve,
been thinking about that a little…just these last…fifteen years or
so.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could
find a girl. One who’s not a mutant…and hopefully comes from Pasadena.
Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from
Pasadena, I don’t know…always just seemed a little nicer.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, there’s also a thing called a liquor
store. Write that down.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Here’s the shopping list and $3,000 which
should take care of everything.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Your father has a few final words for you.
You know, he’d fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both
do.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Heck, I know that mom! You’re my parents.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Adam…don’t forget…don’t forget …</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, father?! Yes?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: …the pipe tobacco.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, sir. Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Also…stay out of the “Adult Bookstore.”</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Adult Bookstore. Why?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Poison gas. Invisible. Don’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I promise. Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: One more thing. If you find a healthy young
woman, bring her back with you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Yes! Yes! Oh, Lord! Yes, oh, yes! But
where is the one who came last night – all in yellow?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: All in yellow? Oh! That was my father!</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Ooooohhhh!! Of course! The father!
Forgive me!! Can you forgive me for my wasted life?! Everything has been
so awful!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I know it has been terrible. But it wasn’t
your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to
get better. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ve got to go, now.</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Of course you do. I’ll stay here and
pray.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That’s always a good idea! Would you like some
money? I have a great deal of it.</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: No. I don’t need money anymore – I see
that now.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How do I leave here?</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: The front door is open. Will you be
back?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>bystander #1</strong>: What? What is it?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The sky!!!</p>
<p><strong>bystander #1</strong>: The sky? Where?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Up there!!</p>
<p><strong>bystander #1</strong>: I don’t see anything!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Just look!!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What is it!</p>
<p><strong>bystander #1</strong>: He sees something.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: I see it, mommy!</p>
<p><strong>bystander #2</strong>: Where?!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I have never in my life seen anything like
this!!!! Nothing even comes close!!</p>
<p><strong>postal worker</strong>: Whatcha looking at?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!</p>
<p><strong>postal worker</strong>: Say what?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How do you do, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>postal worker</strong>: I do alright.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>pakistani</strong>: What is it?! What do you see?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>pakistani</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Poisonous gas!! Run for your life, it’s
invisible poisonous gas!!!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You know–</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Thank you, Calvin. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: He’s smart.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Yes, dear, I know.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hello! Hi. Good afternoon! Howdy.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I tried to give the driver this but he
wouldn’t take it. He seems angry. A lot of people do.</p>
<p><strong>psycho</strong>: There’s a grocery store coming up.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thank-Q! Driver! Please stop the bus
immediately! I have to get off! Do you think I should get a gun?</p>
<p><strong>psycho</strong>: I don’t know…maybe.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Driver! Please stop, sir!</p>
<p><strong>old jewish man</strong>: For the love of God! Let him off the
bus!! Can’t you see he’s meshugina!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m sorry, what did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thank you, driver! Good-bye, everyone!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Is that a birthday cake?!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Gee-ma-nee!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Bakersfield.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: My first mutants.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Is this because of the radiation?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: Help you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, please. I’m looking for all beef
patties.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: Fresh or frozen?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Come on. Frozen. How much are they?</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: Frozen, they’re six-thirty a dozen in the
three pound box.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Then I’ll need, twelve into nine hundred,
seventy-five boxes. And that’s almost…five hundred dollars just for the
hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for
everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday
candles!</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: You could have a meat order that big
delivered to your home.</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well, that’s great then! Terrific…except…it
just occurred to me. I don’t know where I live! I’m lost! I don’t know
where home is! Would you excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>butcher</strong>: Gladly.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Driver! Stop this bus immediately! Please
sir!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh my. Oh, my goodness gracious! Oh, my…Oh.
That is so great!! Man alive!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The name is Adam Webber and I see you buy
baseball cards and although these are a lot older than the ones in the
window, I was hoping you still might be interested.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: How–how much do you want for the Mickey
Mantle, rookie season?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I was thinking of selling all the cards.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Really? No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: See, my problem is, all I have are hundred
dollar bills and I need something smaller. Ones, fives, tens. Like
that.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I see what ya mean. Tell you what…I’ll give
you five hundred dollars in small bills for the whole box.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, that would be wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Well, we’re here to help!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, shit!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I’m workin’ here, Evey-poo. Don’t screw me
up.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Bon soir, mademoiselle!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Are you French?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No. I’m from out of town. I’m here on
business.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, your business must not be sports
memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here– –is worth six
thousand dollars all by its little self.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No, you get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Terrific…you’re fired! You know that?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No, ferry–excuse me, Jerry, I quit.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, no! I fired ya! Just like the hair salon
guy and the Chevy dealer! You know why you can’t keep a goddamn job?!
Because you can’t keep your goddamn mouth shut! That’s why!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sir? I would really appreciate it if you
wouldn’t take the Lord’s name in vain again.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Oh, you got a problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I have a big problem with that.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Come on, Heathcliff, I’ll walk you to the
corner.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, ma’am. But my name is Adam.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Just come on.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hah! Adam and Eve! The perfect match! I hope
you two will be very happy together! Mazel-fuckin’-tov! Don’t try coming
back, Ms. Big Shot! I’m serious this time! You’re finished in the hobby
business! Take that to the bank, why don’tcha!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I didn’t want to leave without saying how much
I admire your jewelry.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Hey, smart ass, how ’bout I kick your
butt?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How ’bout you what?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I said come on!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: We? I’m going home. And, judging by that coat,
I’d say you have to get back to the barber college.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, I’m lost.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You’re lost?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Say,…did you just lose your job because of
me?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Forget it. I’m sick of working for that
dickhead.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Dickhead?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.
A dickhead.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I just had a mental picture of…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Here, pick these up!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I came on a bus.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why doesn’t that surprise me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t know. Why doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, I guess because I’m a little psychic…I
have this thing.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, that’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Let me guess something. This is your first
visit to La La Land. You’re staying somewhere over in Hollywood because,
like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.
Right so far?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So far?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes, I’m right?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and
before you know it, you’re out here in the San Fernando Valley without a
clue. Which brings us to here. Correct again?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That’s exactly
right!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: See? I’m psychic. Not completely, but pretty
much. That was pretty good, wasn’t it?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It was amazing.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for
you to get on.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Do you own a car?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’m not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number
One in North America: No strangers in the car.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: If it will make you feel any better, I don’t
have a gun.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You don’t?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck
away from me!! I mean it!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m sorry! I said something wrong, didn’t I!
Please forgive me!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Get away from me!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait! Please wait! I’ll make a deal with you!
I’ll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you’ll take me to the hotel!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Rogers Hornsby?!?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: He’s all yours. I was holding him back.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Rogers Hornsby’s worth like four thousand
dollars!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: So what?! I’ve got two of him! And this many
DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do
is drive you to your hotel?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: And that’s it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I don’t have to take a physical in your space
ship?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Heck, no! What?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Okay. What the hell? You got a deal. Get
in.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: So…Mister Andretti, your first time on the
freeway?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s Webber. Adam Webber.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Mind if I change the station? Better traffic
reports on AM.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What is it?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s Perry!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Perry?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Perry Como! You had him! Go back! Go back!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Okay, okay! Take it easy!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, I could die…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Over this?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it
really takes off!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You are one scary son-of-a-gun.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey, what are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I know a short-cut.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Gee-zooie!! You better slow down!!!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I can’t help it. Perry Como always does this to
me! I just get so cranked!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Card, please. End of service.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That was…wonderful! I’ve never felt anything
like that in my life.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yeah, same here. Don’t forget your
suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You know–</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Good evening. I want to stay at this
hotel.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Fill this out please. And I’ll need a
card.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: A card?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Of course!</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Bathroom’s there, TV’s over there. Remote’s
on top. Room Service menu is on the table.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: You dial nine to get out.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: The hotel.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I see. Well, thank you very much. You’ve been
very, very nice.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Thank you. Your father is a smart guy.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: My father is a genius.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: No kiddin’. Well…good night.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Good night! Sleep tight. Don’t let the bedbugs
bite! That’s what my Mom always says… …who I’m really beginning to miss.
I’m sorry. It’s my first night away from home.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thirty-five.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: You don’t look thirty-five.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How old do I look?</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Twenty-five? Around there.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I guess living up here makes people look
older.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Up here on the fifteenth floor?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor.
Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>bellboy</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: And Lord we ask finally that you send an
angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What in the hell am I doing here?! That’s what
I’d like to know! Somebody tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: You don’t have a last name?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: All I know is that his first name is Adam. No!
Adam Webber! That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Hi. This is the woman from the baseball card
store. Remember me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes! Hello! Hi! Hot-diggity-dog! Thank you for
calling me on the telephone!!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Good grief. Hey listen, I’m in the lobby. On
the first floor! Where the hell else would it be?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I am so glad to see you!! I thought I’d never
see you again!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Okay, down boy. I can’t take this for driving
you home. I wish I could, but I can’t. So here, take it back. I could
have just left it for you at the desk, but it’s very valuable. Now take
it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I can’t, it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Take it. damn it!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why are you doing that?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I haven’t brushed yet.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait, Eve, please! Wait.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Please don’t follow me. Don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I knew this would happen! You’re like a lost
puppy!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Can’t you please just talk to me for one
second?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Okay! Damn!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I should have taken the money and run! That’s
what Troy told me to do! But do I listen? No! Put your hand down!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thank-Q!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, stop that! God! Listen, I know you like me.
I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me. Not me, exactly.
It’s more like the legs or the butt or the hair. Or some combination of
the above.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I think it’s the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: The eyes. Okay. An eye-man. Anyhow, it never
works out. Okay? Not that you even need to know that! You look like
crap, by the way. What have you been doing?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Watching television in color.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Hey, no kidding? In color?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Cross my heart and hope to die.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: See, ya.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why doesn’t it never work out?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why does it never work out? You and…men?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why?! Who the hell knows?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: …Okay.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It never works out because I’m into legs and
butts and hair myself! That’s why! So I wind up with guys who are very
good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that.
Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying,
demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his
marriage is.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why not go to work for me?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me
buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Food and supplies? Who for? Like starving
people?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well, they’re not starving yet, but they need
help.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: How long would you need me?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What’s the pay?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What’s fair?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’ve got to make at least a thousand a
week.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You got it! Wait here while I change.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: My career’s finally taking off…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Why would someone need twenty yacht
batteries?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I just work for the guy.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: And who does he work for? The CIA?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Naw…it’s some sort of charity thing..I guess
for starving people with yachts.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why not buy them milk or something– instead of
Dr. Pepper?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: They like Dr. Pepper.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Who are these people?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: My Mom and Dad.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Very funny, smart ass.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey! Pipe tobacco! I’m going to need all of
this! This is swell!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Swell? Run, Eve. Run.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, another day, another dollar. Stop staring
at me!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey, you know. I was thinking…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Night!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Night!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We’ll have to rent a refrigerated truck for
the beef and poultry.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It’s your life. And, by the way, it’s a
dandy.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I guess we’ll need another locker.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No problem. We’ll just sell another baseball
card.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You know, Eve – don’t get mad, okay? - - but,
I’d just be lost without you.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And, um …I guess… I guess you and I, uh…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Adam? Don’t even think about it. Okay? I’m
sorry. I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I
didn’t say it. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Now, let’s take the truck back and get
something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: There’s something else I would like you to
help me with.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Name it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well, this is going to sound a little
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, I’m sure it will!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Then forget it.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No, no! I’m sorry! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This is for me.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Think of me as your genie. Just ask.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well… Okay. I would like you to help me find
a…wife.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: A wife?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Because I want to get married.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t want to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You can be single and not alone. Marriage
bites!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Bites what?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: The big one!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It does?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters.
Or ask my divorced mom and dad.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: They’re all divorced?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Everybody’s divorced.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It didn’t used to be that way.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I wouldn’t know. What kind of wife are you
looking for?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: One who’s not a mutant.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No dogs, huh? Okay.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And if possible, I’d like to marry someone
from Pasadena.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: When do you need her by?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, I could probably get you laid in two
weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena…that could take
some time.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That’s what I was afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What do you mean, you can get me laid?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Could we talk about that a little later?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The engine is still running.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Now, get out!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, ma’am!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Stop that ma’am crap!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You almost got us killed!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I told you I’ve never driven before!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Never drive again!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You said it would be easy!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I was wrong!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Is this your house?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Swell!</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: What are you bitching about now?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: I forgot some of my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Your stuff? Let me see that.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You came back for these?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Hey, they’re Ralph Laurens. And who’s this
interesting looking fellow?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: This is Adam. Adam, meet Cliff.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: I do fine, Adam. How ‘bout yourself? You
doin’ any good?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Shana Gillroy’s apartment. Remember her? The
model who went to Harvard? Well, I better get going! Bye, Adam. Nice
coat!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why, thank you! Very nice to have met you,
Cliff! May I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He’s a former boyfriend. We lived together for
about six months. And yes, I’ll admit it. I’ve still kind of got a thing
for him. That’s what you wanted to know, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes
to wear another man’s underpants.</p>
<p>****: What?!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Eve! This guy is un-be-liev-able!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I knew you’d like him.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Darlin’, this is X-File stuff! Think about it!
The guy’s got all this easily negotiable property. He’s obviously
setting something up very big. Like a self-sustaining island off the
coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he’s the head of a cult
that’s doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I’ve heard
worse.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You have very nice ceilings.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin
wrapped in seaweed. Or “nori” if you prefer. I love sushi.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I love Lucy!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You nut!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Here you go. One champagne cocktail.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thank-Q!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I thought only hookers drank those things.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Well, I know Mom sure likes ’em!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Dinner in fifteen minutes. Why don’t we sit
and chat.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: So, Adam…where on earth are you from?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Out-of-town. That’s all he’ll say.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s a very small place. People don’t even
know it’s there.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: And it’s called…?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Maybe Eve can guess. She’s psychic.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Really? Since when?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm
Springs.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I even guessed his hotel, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Right on the button.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Give me your hand.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Oh, my God…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Okay, let’s see…I’m not promising anything. You
okay?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Um-hum.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’m seeing…snow… lots of snow. Way up North.
Are we getting hot?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You live in…Alaska. The only way in or out of
your place is by plane and… you’ve definitely come down here for food
and supplies and… to find a wife!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: That’s right?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ve never met anyone like you in my life.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: She’s right?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Hey, butthead, I’m clairvoyant.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ve got goose-bumps all over me.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Why not just go to… Nome for supplies and a
wife? Isn’t that closer?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yeah, right! That’s where you’d go to find
girls! Nome. He’s gay, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a
few questions. When did Alaska become a state?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: 1959.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Who use to own it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Russia.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: When did we get it from them?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: 1867. Seward’s Folly. We paid 7.2 million
dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I’m quoting my father,
of course.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What’s the capitol?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Juneau.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Hello! It’s Anchorage! Gotcha!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Sorry, that’s the largest city.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Where’s he gone?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He’s gone to check your answers on his
computer.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: He has a computer?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: In the house?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No. We keep it in the backyard. Of course, in
the house. It’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: May I please be excused?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Uh…yeah.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: This must be very new.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s so small.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What are you talking about? This is the new
Mac. You a hacker?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You don’t have a computer in your cabin?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: How do you get through those winters? Well,
you’re right. Juneau. What’s the highest peak?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Mt. McKinley. It’s also the highest point in
North America.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Okay, maybe she is psychic. Let’s go eat!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That would knock my father out.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh, yes. It would probably kill him.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He’s a Windows guy then, huh?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes. He likes windows.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think
of that?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: …I guess it’s…just a matter of personal
taste.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: True.</p>
<p>****: Scenes 131, 132, and 133 should follow scene</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Who are you?!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: I’m the mother.</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: It’s the mother!!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: But first, you have to start with the
clothes!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Exactly. You understand that, don’t you? You
have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: So, what are you seeing?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Money is no object. He’s got cards up the
wazoo.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Wazoo! Try to listen. Whataya think? Surfer,
grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You’re serious, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It means that your taste in men’s apparel is
as bad as your taste in men.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, that’s blunt!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m sorry. But if the shoe fits.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: And I suppose you see him in some sort of
strapless thing, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I see “elegant.”</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: That’s what I’m sensing.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The guy with the underpants!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: That’s boring!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Not on him.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m not wearing his pants.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Why not? He has great pants.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I just don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Alright, I will.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’m busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six
thousand paper napkins.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What do you think, Adam?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: About clothing?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Whatever you two want. If you’ve got the time,
I’ve got the wazoo.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Isn’t it a little tiring to sit up straight
like that?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What about holding your right arm up like that
all the time?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh
sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw
this morning are new.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Almost all of them.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The recovery is very impressive.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the
freeway in six months.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Amazing. I’m very impressed.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Well, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I think…it…works.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Let me show you the entire trousseau!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But first let me show her these!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: How ’bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your
block?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He’s going to kill himself. Go skate out on the
bike path! It’s that way!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: That water’s freezing!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He’s from Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: That’s why little things mean so much to
him.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What?! He wanted to hear some standards!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I get it! I finally get it! You have to see it
to understand it!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hey, Eve!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Have you ever heard the saying, “He hasn’t got
enough sense to come in out of the rain?”</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yep. You know, my father – who is a scientist
– says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn
’t sure what he meant by that.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go
girl hunting tonight?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I certainly do!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Okay. But you know, this business of finding
you a wife – it’s kind of ridiculous, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No it’s not!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I
mean…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Then just help me find a girlfriend! That’s
all I ask. I’ll give you every single card I’ve got left!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I’m just
somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something–</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Would you do it just because you’re my friend?
My very best friend.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well…yeah. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thank Q, Eve!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why did you park way back there?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers
drive her car.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Oh. I see.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Ladies first, Troy! That was close.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: My goodness gracious! This place is
something!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Look unimpressed.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Bored even.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Vaguely bored!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Unimpressed, but still interested.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No! Not crazy!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Do I look crazy?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Be loose.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Just be yourself.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Always good advice.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: For him. It doesn’t work for the rest of
us.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Holy Mo-ly, Miss Pay-o-ly!! This place is
neat-o!!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Jason, Jonathan, this is Adam! Adam, that’s
them!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How do you do?! It’s very nice to meet you,
Jason and Jonathan! My mother always told me that if you meet a person
for the first time it’s easier to remember their names if you use those
names right away.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He’s from Alaska!</p>
<p><strong>jason/jonathan</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Hi, there, Eve, who’s the hunk?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Get lost, Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Hi. I’m Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hello, Sophie, I’m Adam Webber.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Adam lives in Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: No shit?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Tu parle Francais? Tu a un tres bon
accent.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: You speak beautiful French! J’ai habit� a
Paris un an.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Paris!! La ville de lumieres! C’est bien
rencontrer quelqu’un pour pratiquer le francais.</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Si tu veux, nous pouvons pratiquer beaucoup
des choses ensemble.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Quit showing off! We’re here on business!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Good-bye!</p>
<p><strong>sophie</strong>: Non, cherie. A bientot.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I thought I was here to meet women.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Not that one!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I like her.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: And don’t be so obvious!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What have you ordered?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I’m
told.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why?! I think she’s very attractive.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Adam! She’s got bitch written all over her! You
do know what “bitch” means, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can’t
understand for the life of me why you would call her that! Or why Cliff
would say that about you.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Because we’re bitches! Look at her! Look at the
expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.
Please!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How ’bout this one?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Are you kidding?! You wouldn’t even be a crumb
on her table! You don’t see that?!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Eve?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, I’m trying to educate him! It’s nothing
personal.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Adam, I think for you, we should go for
“sweet.”</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yeah, sweet. That’s a nice way of putting
it.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet
her?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Um… Eve?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It’s not so much what you say but how you say
it. Women like men who are unpredictable.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes, really! Basically, they want what they
think they can’t have. Same with guys. That’s why everybody is walking
around here sending off “you can’t have me” signals!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Maybe. But that’s how it works.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Ah-ha! There’s ” Miss Sweet.” At the hors
d’oeuvres table!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yeah. Could be. Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like
a healthy non-mutant to me.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay. All right. And what do I say?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if
need be.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating
tool.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay. Thank you, my friends.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m not sure I want to watch this.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Surprising and funny. Well, I know a duck who
bought some lip balm…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I was wondering if you might help me. I…I seem
to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: Oh, now, that’s a great one!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: Bravo!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thank-Q!</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: This is my new friend…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m Adam Webber.</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: He’s really funny!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hi! I’m Heather!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: “Heather?” I don’t believe I’ve ever heard
that name before.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah, right!</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: I told you! He’s funny!</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: We work on Rodeo Drive. But we’re both
professional dancers.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You dance?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I took a dance lesson everyday of my life
until a couple of days ago.</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: You’re kidding!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, I’m not! My mom taught me.</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: Your mom was a dancer?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would
like her very much! Shall we dance?</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You know, he’s a very, very good–</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Must you…</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What in the hell is wrong with you?!!</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: Is that your girl friend?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No. Would you please excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: If you’ll please come back.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I will certainly try. And thank you both very
much for the dance.</p>
<p><strong>miss sweet</strong>: When was the last time you saw manners
like that?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah. It’s like meeting a foreigner or
something.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Right here? Well, you’re being so bossy I
wasn’t sure!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You wanted to see me!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You’re not from Alaska! Where’d you learn to
dance like that?! And there are no starving people, are there?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Why are you suddenly so mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Don’t change the subject! I want you to tell me
the truth about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ve never lied to you. I’ve maybe let you
believe things that you wanted to believe, but I’ve never lied.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You think I’m some sort of sap?! Don’t
you?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No. I admire you. I…I fell in love with you
the first time I saw you. I did. I think that you are the most–</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I want to know exactly who you are and what
you’re really up to!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In
1962–</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Well, well, well. Don’t we clean up nice?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hello, Cliff, how are you this evening?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: But I do miss that green sport coat of
yours.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that’s my
seat. And I was just–</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: How ’bout a drink at the bar?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: It’s all yours.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: So where is your roommate, the model?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: You know, I don’t know. And looking at you, I
don’t care. It’s been too long, Eve.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Please excuse this interruption.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Oh, brother…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Eve, I don’t mean to be rude, and please
excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn’t Cliff just a butt with hair?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair.
Well, isn’t he? And shallow, as well?</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Shallow? I’m shallow?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Go home, Adam. Go to your hotel.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Yeah. Before I kick your ass.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend
myself.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Do ya?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Stop it, you two!</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: I guess we shouldn’t fight in here.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, I agree.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Adam?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Maybe we shouldn’t fight at all. Fighting is
pretty immature.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It certainly is. I agree with you
completely.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Eve? I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I don’t blame you!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Eve, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cliff</strong>: Well, good night, everyone.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’m leaving, too.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But, Eve, I would–</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you
out–because I quit! This is ridiculous! You’re ridiculous! I’m
ridiculous!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He go back to the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Uh..he might of.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: We did not leave together.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Who did he leave with?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What’s it to you?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I’m his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Hey, you’re the psychic. Eve, the psychic
pimp. You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Those sluts!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yeah. But who’s not a slut these days?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: To bed.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: To bed?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yeah. I’m not the one who’s in love with the
guy.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What?! Now hold on! Wait one damn minute!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: In the first place, I don’t fall in love with
weirdos I’ve only known for four or five days.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yes, you do.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: And I don’t fall in love with grown men who
collect baseball cards!!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Uh, yes, you do.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Or pee in their pants when they see the
ocean!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yes, you do!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Or have perfect table manners.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: You know, I asked him about that. And he said
that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we
respect them. See, you’d eat like a slob if you were alone, but since
another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to
the trouble of having proper manners. I didn’t know that. I thought it
was a way of appearing superior. Know what else he told me?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you
are a lady!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, consider the source. I don’t even know
what a lady is.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody
who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a
gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people
around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That’s it! If you
don’t do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the
houses…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Where did he get all that information?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: From the oddest place. His parent’s told him.
I don’t think I got that memo.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: So now I suppose he’s trying to make those two
dancers feel as comfortable as possible.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He didn’t leave with them.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well…I admit it. I’m glad to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: He left with Sophie.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What?!!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: It’s true. She swept him out the door
whispering little French things into his ear.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don’t tell
me that!!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What are you going to do? Go over to her place
and kick in the door?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You’re goddamn right I am!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Coward!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Gentleman coward, to you.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Come on! Come on, damn it!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Eve?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Scare me, why don’t you?!!? You stupid son of a
bitch!!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’m really sorry!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What in the hell are you doing here!! You’re
supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that
slut Sophie!!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I know…and I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, you should be! Thanks to you, my heart is
in my neck!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Goodnight!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Eve, if you’ll let me, I can –</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Look! I’m limping! How attractive is that?!
What if this is for life?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I know first aid!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, you had better!!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Steady. Steady. It’s going to be all right in
no time.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I went to Sophie’s and she was very
hospitable.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Is that what you call it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: But it just wasn’t where I wanted to be so I
left as politely as I could and found a taxi. But I asked the driver to
drop me here instead of at the hotel. There’s a song Mister Como sings
called “On the Street Where You Live.” You know it?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Sing it to me.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: “All at once am I–several stories high–
knowing I’m–on the street– where you live.” It’s about a young man who
is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he
loves.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Adam…dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever
had sex before?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: How is that possible?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: In 1962, when the bomb was dropped on Los
Angeles, my parents were in our fallout shelter. That’s where I was
born. We only survived because it was a huge shelter as fallout shelters
go. My father worked on it secretly for years. When he had to, he used
contractors, but always from out-of- state and always for just a portion
of the job. He told them it was a secret government experiment done
through CalTech. My Dad’s not a liar, but he felt in this case he had no
choice. Of course, it had to be a secret, because we had just enough
supplies to last three people thirty-five years. That’s also why I have
no brothers or sisters. The air vent was the really tricky part, but he
was able to cut into a flood control sewer. What I’d like to do Eve, is
take you down into the fallout shelter with me. We could live there with
my Mom and Dad. My dad said if I found a healthy girl I should “bring
her on down”. And you look plenty healthy to me.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Uh-huh. Adam?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, Eve?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I want you to go back to the hotel now. I’ll
call you a cab.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Of course. I shouldn’t be over here at this
hour.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: That’s right. And I’ll see you in the morning
in the lobby. Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Not at all. And Eve thank you for tonight…and
for the kiss. My first.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It was at least as good as the sky.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Really? Okay!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And I think better than the ocean. I’m
serious!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Neat. Goodnight!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Goddamn, Adam!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I’m sorry. I took the Lord’s name in vain
again, didn’t I? I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No! There’s an Adult Bookstore back there!
I’ll be right back!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Without question, the strangest man I’ve ever
met.</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Give us a sign! That’s all we ask! Give
us some sort of sign!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Okay, Troy! Let’s get those all-beef frozen
patties!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: How ’bout we check with Eve first?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You bet!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: So, did you buy a movie?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the
bookstore.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, I wouldn’t go in one of those places with
a gas mask on.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I know what you mean! I usually wear a big hat
and dark glasses.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Does that work?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yeah…Seems to.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hi, Eve!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Hi, Adam. This is, uh….</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: I’m Nina Aron, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Very well, thank you. I’m with the County
Family Services Department. Eve tells me you’ve been living in a bomb
shelter most of your life.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Fallout shelter. There’s a difference.</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Adam, I’d like to introduce you to my
associate – Mr. Brown.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: We want you to come with us so we can talk
some more about your experiences.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Come where?</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: My office.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Well, that depends…</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I thank you very much for the invitation, but
I’m quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Adam….you should go with Dr. Aron. It’s the
best thing. The best thing for you. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: …All right, Eve. If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: …I do.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Could I please just go home? I was lost, but
this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever
again.</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Let’s go talk first, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Good-bye, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: You’ll be hearing from me.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to
live underground with him! That’s like Silence of the Lambs, don’t you
think?!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I know…I know. You did the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, no!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: He’ll catch him. Hi. This is Nina Aron. I’ve
got a run away and I’m going to need police assistance.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No! Not the police! Don’t call them!</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: I have to. If a complaint is made and the
person resists obser–</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No, I can’t have that! They’ll come with their
cars and their guns and their handcuffs–</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Calm down, please. This man needs help and you
need protection from him. That’s obvious.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You know, I don’t think so. I’m confused but
you know, I don’t think he’d ever hurt me. I don’t think he’d hurt
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: And now you must let me be the judge of
that!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I was frightened and I didn’t know what to
think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home.
Wherever the hell that is…</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Let’s all remain calm. That’s the key
thing.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: The key to my hotel room! I want you to have
my baseball cards! And please be sure to pay my bill!</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Young man, stop right there!</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Stop, right now! Get out of that truck!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Adam, you really shouldn’t try to drive that
truck!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Bye, Troy!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Bye, Adam!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And thanks for always being happy!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Gay.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Oh. Well, you’re…certainly welcome!</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Hey!!! That’s my car, you son of a bitch!!</p>
<p><strong>brown</strong>: I fell down! What’s the license number of
that truck?!</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: Don’t ask them! They’re as fucked-up as the
other guy!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Let’s all just try to remain calm. That’s the
key thing.</p>
<p><strong>aron</strong>: How ’bout I just knock the shit out of
you?!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I guess he took what he could.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Good God…you don’t think there really is a bomb
shelter, do you?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Fallout shelter.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Mom?! Dad?! I’m home!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’ve got almost everything we need! And this
nice man…</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Archbishop Melker. We met earlier.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: …and his church group have volunteered to help
us bring the supplies down. But we’ve got to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Are you in trouble, son?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I think I’m being chased by a
psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: A psychiatrist?!</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: It happens.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: My goodness! How bad is it up there?!</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Horrible.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You have something on your forehead.</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: This it?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What do you want to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Give it back to him.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: And if we can’t find him?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: We’ll find him.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Hey, Eve? Eve?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: I don’t know. Everything’s so neat. It’s all
just so…goddamn dear. Damn!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: See these? Found them in the box with the
cards. These are stock certificates. IBM. AT&amp;T. Polaroid.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Purchased in 1958 and ’59? Ten thousand
shares of each? They’d be worth millions. Hell, I don’t know…millions
upon millions upon millions! How ’bout that?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Thanks, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Millions upon millions upon millions! The
cards. The stock! The clothes! The toothpaste! The guy was on the level!
And you blew it! A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most
polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in
your life!! And what do you do?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Have him committed.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yeah! That’s thinking.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: He was always so “nice”! How was I supposed to
know that’s a good thing?! “Nice” is weird! Nice is…what is “nice”? It’s
not cool! I’ll tell you that. Was it ever?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I don’t know. I like to think so.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, at least I fell for him before I found
out he was rich! That’s new. Wait a minute! He said today he knew where
home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: To get some frozen poultry.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: We came back to the house!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You didn’t stop anywhere else?!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno
store.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: An adult bookstore. He was very excited about
seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Trendy address.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Have you got a basement?</p>
<p><strong>pakistani</strong>: Believe me, all the really good stuff is
right here.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Is there a back entrance?</p>
<p><strong>pakistani</strong>: Are you kidding? Of course.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Why would you put a fallout shelter under a
porno shop?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: None of this stuff was here in 1962. The
Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Well, we’ve come a long way, haven’t we? I want
to go home.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Yeah. Maybe he’ll call.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Hi. Troy and Eve are out so leave a message.
And if you want to leave a number don’t say it fast! I hate that! Say it
slow. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Uh, Eve…this is Adam. Look, I just wanted to
thank you for everything you did for me…and I wanted to tell you that
I…uh…that I wish so many good things for you. I wish so hard that all of
your dreams come true. Um…I, uh…</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Adam!!</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Where?!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Adam!!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: How long will you set it for this time?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I thought ten years.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, that’s…considerably shorter than
before. I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all. I mean the
radiation is gone and…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: To keep what’s up there from getting down
here! It’s not the radiation I’m worried about.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Mom? Dad?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I’d like for you to meet Miss Eve
Rustokov.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: How do you do, Mrs. Webber? Mr. Webber?</p>
<p><strong>webbers</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Uh-huh. I’ve heard so many wonderful things
about you.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, please excuse us! We…we haven’t
entertained a guest in…um…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Some time.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What can I offer you, Eve?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Mom? Eve and I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: I can’t explain it now. But I want you to set
the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything. Then
we’ll be back to get you.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: But, I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: And, I’m asking you to trust me without
understanding why.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well, in that case…of course, son.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: They are wonderful parents.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: We have to go.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No, wait! At least stay for dinner!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yes, please! You must.</p>
<p><strong>adam/eve</strong>: Well…sure…okay.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Adam said I shouldn’t mention the
Communists.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, yes! Please, don’t mention the
Communists!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Eve. I hope I’m not being nosey, but are you
and Adam…um…dating?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Yes, Mrs. Webber we are. I’m also from
Pasadena.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: A toast! To Adam and Eve!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: What is this sh…stuff?!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hot Dr. Pepper! Most people don’t know how
good it is heated up.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You know, they don’t, do they?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Oh, my goodness! We almost forgot! I like
your friend, Adam.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: And you thought your parents were weird.</p>
<p><strong>broker</strong>: It’s like the Garden of Eden, don’t you
think?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You see, that night, Adam had a choice between
me and his parents.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It’s truly amazing what you can get done when
you have unlimited funds. Did you know you can have whole houses built
in just a matter of months. All you have to say is this…“I don’t care
what it costs.” And then, of course, you’ve got to really mean it, which
no one ever does.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: That lamp is perfect!</p>
<p><strong>store owner</strong>: I’m holding that for Elton John.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Oh, I think not.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Eve, I’ve got to go back! My parents can’t
handle this up here. And there was no bomb, was there?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: See! I can’t tell them that! I can’t ever let
them know. It makes their life..well, frankly… a joke. I can’t let that
happen. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I’m
very good at making things work!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: My mother’s like that.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: It took a while to convince Archbishop Milker
that Adam wasn’t God, and he was pretty broken up about it, too, until I
showed him my plans for Los Angeles’ hottest and most original night
spot.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: You’ll be a ten percent partner and still
retain ownership of the entrance.</p>
<p><strong>soda jerk</strong>: Praise the Lord. And I mean the real
one.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Our idea was to bring Adam’s parents up to the
surface very slowly. Make them very comfortable and then break the bad
news to them that there was no nuclear holocaust. And if that doesn’t
kill them Adam’s going to tell his father about the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: You put the tape in here and you get a movie –
in your own home.</p>
<p><strong>eve/troy</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: This is your bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: No, Mom, I’ve turned it into Dad’s office.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Well, where are you –</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Eve and I…eloped. We’re married.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Is that all right?</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: It’s wonderful, dear! Wonderful!!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: That’s wonderful. We Webber guys have mighty
good luck when it comes to women.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s kind of a combination television-
typewriter-telephone-post office type of thing. I’ll show it to you
later.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: This is great son, just great. By the way,
Eve’s last name. Rus-to-kov, that’s not Russian, is it?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: It’s Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated
here.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Dad, I don’t know how to tell you this. And I
was going to wait a while, but I think…Dad,there was no bomb. A plane
crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a
shot being fired. The Cold War is over.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: That’s what everybody believes?</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes, sir. It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What? Did the politburo just one day say -
“We give up?”</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Yes. That’s kind of how it was.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You’ve
got to hand it to ’em! “No, we didn’t drop any bombs! Oh yes, our evil
empire has collapsed! Poor, poor us!” I bet they’ve even asked the West
for aid! Right?!</p>
<p><strong>adam</strong>: Uh, I think they have.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly
dissemblers! Those, uh… They’ve finally pulled the wool over everybody’s
eyes!</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Have you ever in your life seen a son who did
more for his parents?</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Adam says that this is simply how things work.
First the parents take care of the children and then the children take
care of the parents. He says historically, that’s how it works.</p>
<p><strong>eve</strong>: Whenever Adam gives me such obviously incorrect
information, I just smile, slap him on the knee, and look out the
window. Why spoil his dreams? They’re such wonderful dreams.</p>
