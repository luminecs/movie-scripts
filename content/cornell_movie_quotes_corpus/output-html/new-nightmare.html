<p><strong>cut to a camera and dolly – behind, in the shadows –
a</strong>: SHADOWY CREW GASPS – we hear a muffled EEUWWW –</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: More blood, more blood!</p>
<p><strong>craven</strong>: Chase, you’re a genius! This makes his old
claw look like Mother Theresa’s!</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: It’s some of our best work.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Want to see some neat stuff?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Chase, no.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Come on, it’s only make believe!</p>
<p><strong>snarling monster heads, lon withered arms,
eviscerated</strong>: TORSOS, propped in corners and peering off
temporary shelves. The handiwork of Chase’s SPFX MAKEUP wizardry.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Chase!</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: It should have flexed more. I think the
servos got shorted out with blood.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Insulate ’em with some styro. It wasn’t
designed to be submerged, for Petesakes.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I don’t like that thing.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: This thing puts bread on our table.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Is it alive, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: Heather, you’re in the next shot!</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Might as well be, Dylan. State of the art
animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting. Bull tendons, nerve
bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate
was…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Chase…</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Must’ve picked up something from an AD’s
walkie-talkie…</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: You sure it’s turned off?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: It’s off.</p>
<p><strong>terry</strong>: Funny. It’s warm. Like a real hand.</p>
<p><strong>craven</strong>: What the hell’s going on?! Kill the
effects!</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Heather!</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Heather!! Earthquake!!</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Mommmmeee!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan!</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Car alarms. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: no.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You have a fever, sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Just an earthquake, Dylan. Every once in a
while we get a few.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No biggie, really.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Daddy, blood.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Nothing, guys, just a scratch.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Where’d you…get that?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: The picture, I guess. When it fell. It’s
nothing, really.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: One of mom’s cups got broken.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I’m sorry. At least we’re in on piece.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Do we have to watch that?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I thought you turned it on.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan, it’s breakfast. Not arts and crafts
What?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You get any sleep last night?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: More or less. Dylan, time to get dressed.
I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: You going away?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Just for a few hours. Julie’ll be with
you.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Anything other than the obvious bothering
you?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Five earthquakes in three weeks is
enough.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Hasn’t been another call, has there?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He feels closer, if anything. It’s giving
me nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You have one last night?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Maybe. Or maybe I shouldn’t do this
interview today.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You’ve got to get back on the horse some
time. Look, you’ve had a nutcase making harassing phone calls. I know
how scary that feels.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Okay, but it still doesn’t mean it can’t be
over with.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What if it isn’t over?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Maybe you should tell me your dream.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It was nothing. We were both working on
some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong. Terry and
Chuck were…hurt. You were almost… You were even cut.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: You probably were half awake and saw me get
nicked by that picture glass. Dreams work like that. You want me not to
go on this job?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Just be careful, okay?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I should survive two days in Palmdale
supplying soap bubbles for a detergent commercial, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Guess so.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: 48 hours. Back before you know it.</p>
<p><strong>tina</strong>: Naaancyyyy….</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan, I don’t want you watching that.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: One two…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Chase!</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Someone’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Heather?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah, Julie, I’m sorry. I just
thought…there was an earthquake, I think. Little one, but…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Big truck went right by before you opened the
door. Life on the Fault Line.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You think he has a fever? He felt warm to
me this morning.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Seems okay. That all that’s wrong? You
seem…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Leave us alone, you creep!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: LA Limousine, ma’am. Just wanted you to know
I’m out front.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Uh, sorry. Hang on a minute.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Heather, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dunno. Just have this feeling today…</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Mommy stay home, then.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He’ll be fine, don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Studio B.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hi. This is Heather Langenkamp.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: The car’s no there yet?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No. I…listen, I can’t make it in today.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: You’re kidding, right?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m sorry, I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Listen, dammit.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I just can’t.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: One two…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Freddy’s coming for yooooouuuu.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: What is it, Heather?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Damn caller.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: He’s started again?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Nerves?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I just meant form the shaker this morning. I
mean, everyone’s freaked out at how many we’ve been having. Then the
calls.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Stop calling me, you sonuvabitch!</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: You talk to your agent this way? And you
try to cancel an appearance on AM/LA at the last damn minute. What the
hell’s with you?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m sorry, Jerry. I just…can’t leave the
house right now.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What, you wanna single-handedly bury your
career?! Lose your house, put your husband and kid out on the street? Or
just give your old agent a heart attack?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Okay, fine, I’ll be there. It’s just, the
calls started again.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: Unfortunately, this kinda crap is part of the
business these days, Heather. Have you thought of buying a good
handgun?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’ve got a five-year old in the house,
Jerry!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: He’s an L.A. kid, probably already has one.
Call me after the interview, okay?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan, I gotta go. Forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ll call the cops for you. You’ve got the
number on the fridge, right?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Thanks. Just give them the time he called.
They’re keeping a list, supposedly. Sorry. My nerves are so raw these
days.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: ’S okay.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You played that girl…in that movie…with the
guy with the Yeah, sure, that’s you. That’s what I love about this job,
I get to meet the stars.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m hardly a star.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You kidding? I love your stuff. First was
the best. Where your girl friend’s cut open and dragged across the
ceiling? Awesome! And when all that blood comes out of your boyfriend’s
bed? Thought I’d shi…</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: Heather? We’re gonna have to run!</p>
<p><strong>lights blinding into lens. camera tips down to
reveal</strong>: HEATHER and a smiling TALKSHOW HOST.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: So, Heather, we’re coming up on the 10th
anniversary of the first Nightmare on Elm Street. It’s five sequels
later. Tell us how this amazing series has affected your life
personally.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I don’t know if it has, really. With the
exception of One and Three, I’ve pretty much kept out of it. I’m working
in television now. The hours let me spend more time with my husband and
little boy.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Now that you have a child, is it possible
you’ve decided horror is bad for children?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No, not really. I…</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Do you let your child watch your movies?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: My child? No…but…</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: What about another sequel? Is Freddy really
dead?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Of course he is. Freddy’s dead and
gone.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: And how about your co-star in NIGHTMARE I.
Would you trust him alone with your child?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Robert? I…</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Maybe we should ask him, hmmm? We’ve got a
surprised, Heather. A great big surprise for you and our audience.</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: You’re all my children now!</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: Everything went great, I thought. We
really got you, didn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I don’t know why you didn’t tell me, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: Hey, they loved the expression on
your face. I think they’d love to see us together again!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: In what, a romantic comedy?</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: Just because it’s a love story
doesn’t mean it can’t have a decapitation or two.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Heather? Call for you!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Heather, this is Sara Risher over at New Line.
How are you?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh, hi. I’m fine, Sara. My God, a voice
from the past!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Really! Listen, Heather, I won’t take but a
minute of your time. It’s just that we have something to propose to you,
and wonder if you’d stop by the offices. Bob’d love to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Uh…sure…when?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: No time like the present. The car will bring
you.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Just take a minute. You’ll be glad you did, I
bet.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Help you?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’m here to see Bob Shaye.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Was Bob expecting you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Heather!</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Bob’s dying to see you.</p>
<p><strong>mike de luca</strong>: Hey, I’m a fan! Great meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Can I get you something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Coffee’d be nice.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Sounds good. Kim, would you get Heather and me
a coffee? How you like it, Hon?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Black’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Gotta go. Call me when you get to Milan. And
don’t forget risotto con tarfutti. Fantastico! Have fun.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Fine. I don’t have to ask how you’re
doing.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So far so good. Maybe we can send a little your
way, too, if you’re up for it.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I thought you’d killed Freddy off.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We did. Bad mistake. The fans are clamoring for
more. So, Evil never dies, right? Anyway, a while back we got a call
from Wes. He’s got this idea. And who better to resurrect Freddy than
his creator?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I thought he’d stopped doing horror.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Believe it or not, he told me I hadn’t heard
from him in ten years because he hasn’t had any good nightmare. They’re
his inspiration. But now he’s got a new script in the works.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Which means he’s having nightmares
again?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He’s very excited about it.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: The nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He’s excited about the script. You should be
too. It stars you.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Can I read it?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: He’s not showing it until it’s down. But it
sounds hot, and we wanted to get all our stars lined up in case it is.
You and Robert got great ratings today. Which is the first thing we
needed to know.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You mean that was a…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sort of a trial balloon.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I don’t know, Bob. I’m flattered and all,
but I’ve got a kid, now.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: So I don’t know about horror.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Come on. Kids love horror.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: And I…I’ve got other things happening.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I’m sure we can match any offer.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It’s not that. I’ve got a fan.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Sweetie, you’ve got lots of fans, we’ve done
market studies. You rate right up there. We’ve already got Chase working
on a prototype for the glove.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I know. We asked him to keep it kind of
surprise until we talked. Look, how about we get in touch your agent.
You still with Jerry?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yes, but…</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: We’ll work something out. I’m sure you’ll be
happy with it.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Bob, how long has Wes been working on this
script?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t know. A couple months. Why?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: And since you’ve been thinking of making
it. Has anything funny happened?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: I don’t follow.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Like weird calls, by any chance?</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: That’s what people get paid for around
here.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: It’s Ted in New York. He wants to know how the
glove is coming.</p>
<p><strong>bob</strong>: Gotta take that. Keep in touch.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You too, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Never sleep again, never sleep again!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’s going on? Was he watching the movie
on TV again?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Movie? He hasn’t been watching any TV at all.
He was taking his nap when I heard screaming.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Rex saved me.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Rex? Who’s Rex?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Is Rex gonna die?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No, Rex is not going to die. Julie, you
know where the sewing stuff is, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Sure. We’ll do an operation, Doctor Dylan and
Doctor Julie. We’ll fix him good as new.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Heather?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Chase. Hi…</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Chase, you’d better come home.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Heather, I’m stuck here. Neither Chuck or
Terry came in today. I can’t get away!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Chase, it’s Dylan!</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He’s had some sort of…episode.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: What? What kind of episode?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He was just acting very strange. He thinks
somebody’s after him, Chase. It’s scary, it scared me. He was acting
like…</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Like Freddy.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Heather, has there been another call?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Chase. Why didn’t Chuck or Terry show
up?</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: Forget those two clowns, Heather. Answer me,
did you get another call from that guy or not?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: I’ll be there in three hours.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Don’t speed, Chase. It’s not…</p>
<p><strong>holds on him a beat, then moves up and into the back of
the</strong>: TRUCK AGAIN.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: “…as soon as the sun was up the witch made
Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire. ‘We will bake cookies first,’
she said. ‘I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough. Crawl in and
see if the fire is blazing high enough now.’ And she pushed Gretel
toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she
was inside.” Dylan, this is too violent. I don’t know why you like these
stupid old tales.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Finish, please!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: This is going to give you nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: I like this story.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: “But Gretel guessed what the witch was
planning. ‘I don’t know how to get in,’ Gretel said. ‘How am I to manage
it?’ ‘Stupid girl!’ shouted the witch, rushing up to the oven. ‘The
opening is big enough. See, I can fit myself.’ Then quickly Gretel came
behind and pushed with all her might. Plunging the wicked old woman
headlong into the flames, banging the door shut and bolting it tight.
The witch howled…” That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: “The witch howled like a scalded cat, but
Gretel ran away and left her there to perish nonetheless.”</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Time for sleep.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Say how they find their way back home.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: No. Tonight. It’s important!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan, you know as well as I do, they
follow the trail of bread crumbs back to their house.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: “Then their father covered them with kisses
and they were safe.”</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: They were safe and could sleep.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Rex.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: The mean old man with the claws.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan, there’s nothing down there.
Look…</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: It’s different when you’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Okay, sweetie, night, night, sleep
tight.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Don’t let the bedbugs bite.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He’s on his way.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: He can follow the breadcrumbs, right?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: It the birds don’t eat them first.</p>
<p><strong>newscaster</strong>: …tectonic nightmare…fault line hitherto
unknown seems to be spread so extensive that …</p>
<p><strong>chase</strong>: This is meeee, losing myyyy religion. Look at
meee, losing myyyy…</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Mommy scared?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Mommy’s fine, Dylan. Just had a bad dream.
What’re you doing out of bed?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Rex woke me up. He was fighting.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan, you go back to sleep now.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Not sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan, go back to bed. I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman #1</strong>: Heather Langenkamp?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman #1</strong>: Is Chase Porter your
husband?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman #1</strong>: I’m afraid there was an
accident. It appears he fell asleep while driving, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Is he…I mean, was he hurt?</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman #2</strong>: I’m afraid it’s worse than
that, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman #2</strong>: Yes ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Are you sure it’s him? I…</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman #2</strong>: We have his effects, you can
confirm from that.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I want to see the body.</p>
<p><strong>highway patrolman #1</strong>: No, you don’t, ma’am, it’s not
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I want to see for myself.</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: Help you?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Porter. Chase Porter.</p>
<p><strong>third man</strong>: That a new one?</p>
<p><strong>lunch eater</strong>: Over there, third from the sink.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Let me see once more.</p>
<p><strong>lunch eater</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Lift the sheet again.</p>
<p><strong>lunch eater</strong>: Uh, well, this was a bad wreck, ma’am.
I mean, his head’s gonna be okay for the funeral and all, but…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What did that?</p>
<p><strong>lunch eater</strong>: Ma’am, it was head-on. I heard the
truck was torn up something awful. You can imagine how he’d, well, not
be exactly in top shape.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It looks like…he was clawed.</p>
<p><strong>lunch eater</strong>: Yeah, well, that’s why we don’t lift
the sheet past the face, ma’am. Sometimes what you don’t see is what
gets you through the night.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Julie. Where’s Dylan?!</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: He’s right here. It’s okay!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What…happened?</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: Quake knocked you off your feet. You got
bumped pretty good, actually.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: May he rest in peace, children. And my you
all get home safely!</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: If there’s anything I can do,
Heater. Anything…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan. Sweetie. Wake up, baby…</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: I can’t sleep there, Mommy. Please!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You’ve got to sleep, Dylan, you…</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: One two, Freddy’s coming for you…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan, did you hear that in that move?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: What movie?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Then…where did you hear that song? Did you
answer the phone?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: In my bed.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Your bed?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Under my covers. Kids singing, and way down
there, the man…the mean man…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: And…what’s the man doing?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Trying to get up…trying to get into our
world.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh, shit. Dylan.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Where’s Daddy now?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Daddy’s…in Heaven, Dylan. He’s with God
now.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Do you have to die to see God?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No, I don’t think so. You just have
to…pray, or reach…</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Why does God let there be bad things?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I honestly don’t know. Try to sleep,
baby.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Can you come with me in my dreams?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I think that only happens in movies. But
I’ll always be here when you get back. And I’ll make sure nobody grabs
your toes, either.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I know what he’s doing is bizarre, but most
of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted. I just can’t believe
it’s him. I mean, and not something outside, influencing him. Or is that
how denial works?</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: When it is denial. I don’t think that’s
the case here, but if you’re really worried, have a doctor check him
out. You’ll see, everything’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You’re not just saying that to help a crazy
friend cope, are you?</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: All of Dylan’s behavior is
understandable for a kid dealing with a parent’s death. How can a child
process such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Don’t know. Haven’t been able to process it
very well myself.</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: You’re not crazy, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels
pretty crazy. And jumping in…</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: You didn’t jump in.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: That’s my memory. And it seemed absolutely
real.</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: Seemed, not was.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It’s in my family, you know. My grandmother
died in an institution…</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: Really? Hell, if having a screwy family
made you crazy, the world’d be one colossal nuthouse.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’ve never mentioned it to him.</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: Kids know when something’s bugging a
parent. You’ve got no idea who this is calling?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Freddy, for all I know.</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: Steady…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: A man, or a boy with a deep, y’know, Freddy
voice.</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: Six weeks of this, and you’re surprised
you’ve got Freddy in your dreams? Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he
was seeing his stalker everywhere. Even at Mass.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: Absolutely. And how many times has
Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen
again? It gets under your skin if you let it.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You really think Dylan’s okay?</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: Dylan’s fine. You’re fine. Hurting, but
fine. Definitely not crazy.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It’s my worst fear, that whatever my mother
had, I’ll have. And I’ll pass it along to…</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: God wouldn’t take me.</p>
<p><strong>voice #2</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Robert?</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: Heather? You doing okay?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Holding my own. You know that guy who was
calling me all the time? He’s started again. He’s been putting stuff in
my mail.</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: Must’ve read about the funeral. Sick
mother. That’s the last thing you need right now, I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It’s actually been giving me Freddy
nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: Freddy as in me?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It isn’t you. He’s scarier. He’s…</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: Darker. More…evil?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah…how’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: Call it a guess…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Anyway, what I was calling about was…have
you seen any of the script, by any chance?</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: Wes won’t show it until it’s
finished. That’s what he told me, at least. I asked him at the
funeral.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: When do you think it’ll be done?</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: The way he’s writing is so weird,
who knows? I asked him how far he’d gotten at the funeral, and what was
it he said…? Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God. Weird, huh,
that he’d have your kid in it?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Robert? Have you been having any
nightmares?</p>
<p><strong>robert englund</strong>: Uh, actually today’s not good.
There’s something I’ve got to finish. How’s tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Tomorrow, then. First thing in the morning.
Meanwhile take care, Robert, okay?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: One two, Freddy’s coming for you. Three four,
better lock your door…</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Five six, grab your crucifix…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Sweetie, don’t sing that…</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Seven eight, better stay up late!</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Never sleep again.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Never sleep again, never sleep again…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan…</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: I touched him.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Any history of epilepsy in your
family?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Diabetes?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Was there any trigger event? A trauma,
shock or… You haven’t shown him any of the films you make, have you? The
horror stuff?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Good. I’m convinced they can tip an
unstable child over the edge.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Unstable? Dylan’s not unstable, he’s…
just…upset.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: We’ll run a battery of tests and know in
a few days.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Does he have to stay here over night?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Sometimes what a child says or
fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him. Did he say anything while
he was still lucid?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No. Dylan didn’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What have we here?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: It’s too soon to know for sure, but the
early symptoms point towards childhood schizophrenia.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Home, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Time for your medicine, cowboy.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Just something to help him sleep.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Okay, Dylan. I’ll be back here first thing
tomorrow. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>radio newscaster</strong>: Seismologists at CalTech have
counted over 300 of the temblors so far. Though most were too faint for
us to feel, seven have shaken our community in the last two weeks. And
now scientists are speculating there might be an unknown fault running
beneath Los Angeles, a fault that could…</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: Robert?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: This is Heather, Patrice. I was calling for
Robert. He’s not there?</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: He’s…out of the house, Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Will he be back any time soon?</p>
<p><strong>patrice</strong>: Uh…actually, we’re ducking out of town for
a while.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: I wish I could tell you where this script is
going. I don’t know. Look, I dream a scene, I write it down the next
morning. Your guess is as good as mine as to how it ends.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Well at least tell me what it’s about so
far.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: I can tell you what the nightmares are about.
They’re about this…entity. Whatever you want to call it. It’s old, very
old, and it’s taken different forms in different times. The only thing
that stays the same about it is what it lives for.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Killing innocence, one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: This is still a script we’re talking about,
right?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: I think of it as sort of a nightmare in
progress.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Then, in this nightmare in progress, does
this thing have any weaknesses?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: It can be captured, sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Captured? How?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: By storytellers, of all things. Every so often,
they imagine a story good enough to catch its essence. Then it’s held
prisoner for a while. In the story.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Like the Genie in the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Exactly. The problem comes when the story dies.
It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too
watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti’s labeled
a threat to society and just plain banned. However it happens, when the
story dies, the evil is set free.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You saying Freddy’s this ancient thing?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Current version. For ten years he’s been
imprisoned as Freddy by the story of Nightmare on Elm Street. But now
that the films have stopped- The genie’s out of the bottle, Heather,
that’s what the nightmares are about. That’s what I’m writing.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: If Freddy’s loose, I mean, in your script,
where’s he going to go? Another age? Another form?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: That’s not what the dreams say he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Then what is he doing?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Well, see, he’s gotten used to being Freddy
now. And kinda likes it here in our time and space, too. So…he’s trying
to cross over, from film into our reality.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Isn’t there anyone that can stop him?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Interestingly enough, in the dreams there is
one person. A gatekeeper, so to speak. Someone Freddy’s got to get by
before he can enter our world. It’s you, Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Me? Why me?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Dramatically speaking it makes perfect sense.
You played Nancy, after all, the first to humiliate and defeat him.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: That was Nancy, not me!</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: But it was you that gave Nancy her strength. So
to get out he has to come through you. And it’s inevitable that he’ll
hit you at your most vulnerable points…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan. And… Chase. My God, Wes, did you
know?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Heather, it’s just a movie, a dream,
really…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You know damn well it’s more than that now!
How can we stop him?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: The way to stop him is to make another movie.
And I swear to you I’ll stay at my computer and keep writing until I
finish the script. But when that time comes… You’re gonna have to make a
choice.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Choice? What kind of choice?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Whether or not you’re willing to play Nancy one
last time.</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: …incipience of aphasia commonly preceded by
periods of acute irritability…delusional accounts of shadow figures…
hearing of voices… seizures, nausea and emesis…</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: A six-point quake on the Richter Scale,
bringing scattered destruction throughout L.A. Basin…</p>
<p><strong>sara</strong>: Heather? This is Sara. Um, sorry to call so
late, but…this is kinda hard… I don’t know if you’ve seen the news, but…
we just are thinking we might shelf this new Nightmare project for a
while, and wanted you to know. Call. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>freddy</strong>: Naaaaancy!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Julie, what’re you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I don’t know. I just…had this terrible
dream…that Dylan was in danger. I had to come over to see… You must
think I’m crazy.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No, I don’t think that at all. How is
he?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: They wouldn’t let me…</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Ms. Langenkamp. I’m afraid there are no
evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Is he all right?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Dylan? He’s holding well. Earlier he had
some problems, he’s in an oxygen tent just now…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: It seems we’ve had an accident,
Mrs. Langekamp. May I?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It happened during the earthquake. I fell.
I want to see Dylan…</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: In a moment, first let’s see about
you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: If these had been a few inches nearer to
the wrist… What did you say you cut yourself on?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: It was an earthquake and it was dark. I
have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: These look quite fresh.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: They are…it happened in tonight’s quake. It
happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must’ve felt it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Guess we lucked out over here.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I meant to bring him his dinosaur, Rex. Rex
keeps Freddy from…</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: The man from your films? Freddy Krueger
with the claws? Is that who he’s afraid of? You have let your child see
your films, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Every kid knows about Freddy. He’s like
Santa Claus or King Kong.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: I see. Well. Interesting talking to you,
Ms. Langenkamp. I hope you understand, my concerns are simply for the
welfare of your son.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan, honey. You shouldn’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>dylan/freddy</strong>: Too late. I’m almost there, Heather,
I’m almost there.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Doctor…</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Get her back! I’ve got to go in! Get me
a full anesthetic, STAT!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: We don’t have any here, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Screw it, then. I’m going in!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Nooooo!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Now what have you done to yourself, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He’s got him. He’s got my Dylan!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Who? Who’s got him?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Freddy…</p>
<p><strong>nurse #2</strong>: Freddy…? Who, Freddy Krueger or
something?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: My baby. Freddy’s got my baby! He’s got my
Dylan!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Ms. Langenkamp. I suggest you go home
and get some rest. Your son is fine. He’s been taken downstairs for
further testing.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He was just here!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: He was here. You fell asleep. We took
him. You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn’t wake you. Besides, the
young woman, Julie, is with him. Believe me, everything is fine.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Everything is not fine!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Call security.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>testing nurse #1</strong>: This is a restricted area. Do you
have a pass?!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Screw your pass!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: It’s all right, now…Ms. Langenkamp, just
remain calm. Tell us how our boy is doing.</p>
<p><strong>needle nurse</strong>: He’s fine, actually. He came out of
coma ten minutes ago. It’s looking like acute sleep deprivation. I don’t
think she ever lets the kid get a night’s sleep.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Munchausen syndrome…?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’re you saying? Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Over here, Heather.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You okay, champ?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Can we go get Rex, now? The bad man’s getting
awful close.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I know he is, sweetie. We’ll both go get
Rex right now.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: I’m afraid Dylan really should stay with
us until we know what’s causing these episodes, Ms. Langenkamp. I’m sure
you understand.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Tell you what. I’m gonna go get Rex for you
right now. You know home isn’t far from here, right?</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Right ’cross the freeway.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: That’s right. So I won’t be long. Meanwhile
Julie’s gonna be right here with you.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Hurry back, please. I’m sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Promise. Cross my heart. But until Mommy
gets back, Dylan, whatever you do, don’t fall asleep.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I’ll stick to him like glue, Heather. Swear
to God.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: DO you mind…</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp. For
Dylan’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: If you don’t mind, I’ve got something more
important to do than to make small talk.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Won’t you please be patient. All of this
is just routine.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Uh-oh…</p>
<p><strong>nurse at cabinet</strong>: Would you mind stepping outside
for just one moment, miss?</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: As a matter of fact, I would. What do you
think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>nurse at cabinet</strong>: Just a little shot to see that he
gets some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: No way. His mother specifically said…</p>
<p><strong>nurse at cabinet</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>nurse #2</strong>: All done.</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Bitch!</p>
<p><strong>nurse #2</strong>: Hey! You can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: I know what’s in that one. Do you know what’s
in this one? Or what it’ll do when I stick you with it? And I will…</p>
<p><strong>julie</strong>: Dylan. Don’t fall asleep! Dylan!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Ms. Langenkamp, has…there been any use
of recreational drugs in your family? Or any history of mental
disturbance?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What the hell are you asking?</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Please don’t take this wrong. But if
there was, there’s a good chance Dylan could be suffering from something
passed down to him. Have you been suffering from any delusional events,
Ms. Langenkamp?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: There are drugs and treatments,
Ms. Langenkamp. We could place Dylan in foster care for a short while.
Run some tests on you…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I want my kid out of here now!</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: Very well. As soon as we gather the
appropriate papers…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You don’t understand. If Dylan falls
asleep,then…</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: Where’s mommy? Where’s…</p>
<p><strong>nurse abbott</strong>: Forget it. Nothing you can do there.
Call the cops. Now!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: My son. Did you see my son?</p>
<p><strong>nurse #2</strong>: I…thought he was here…I thought…</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: No way he’s going anywhere. He’s been
well sedated.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He doesn’t have to be awake to be on his
feet.</p>
<p><strong>dr. hefner</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: He sleepwalks, you idiot! He’s fully
capable of walking out of this hospital. Oh my God…He thinks I’ve gone
home…</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: John Saxon. Do you have any idea what
time it is?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: John. It’s Heather. I need help!</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: You got it. What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan’s run away from the hospital. I don’t
know whether he’s wandering around or heading for the house. But I think
Freddy’s after him. I know it sounds crazy!</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: You’re right. That sounds crazy!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: John. Will you please just look for him
around the hospital? I’m gonna go right to the house. Will you help me,
John? Please!</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: I’m on my way. You go home, Heather.
That’s the smart thing to do. I’ll call you there!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Thank you, John. I’ll never forget…</p>
<p><strong>we zoom across the street to an embankment. up the</strong>:
EMBANKMENT. TO THE TINY FIGURE up there in cowboy pajamas. Doggedly
clawing his way up through the weeds and cresting the hill. There, lit
now by the flare of a thousand headlights, is Dylan, staring across
either lanes of high- speed traffic. Trying to see his home!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylannnnnnn!!!!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Dylan!!!</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: Holy…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Where’s Dylan?! Have you seen him?</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: Relax, Nancy. Relax!</p>
<p><strong>dylan</strong>: One two, Freddy’s coming…Freddy’s coming…</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: What in the world happened?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I know how Chase really died.</p>
<p><strong>john saxon</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Fred Krueger did it.</p>
