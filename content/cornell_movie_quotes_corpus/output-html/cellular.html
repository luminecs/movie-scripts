<p><strong>cellular</strong>: by</p>
<p><strong>titles over yellow background.</strong>: We PULL BACK to
reveal we’re looking at THE SUN. In the distance lie the gorgeous San
Gabriel Mountains and the Downtown Los Angeles skyline. In ONE LONG
TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal the vast expansive
homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood. HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a
PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a gleaming mountain bike… It’s early in the
morning, and the landscapers haven’t come with their leaf blowers yet.
CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face the resplendent Martin
residence. We STEADICAM down the fr ont walk, able to admire the
manicured hedges and the black E scalade in the driveway, to the front
door decorated with a whimsical placard that reads, “The Martins” – and
we pass THROUGH THE KEYHOLE into the foyer.</p>
<p><strong>int. jessica’s house - morning</strong>: We TRACK through the
living room, passing framed photos of an athletic eleven year old boy,
and we hear a WOMAN’S VOICE as she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN
RETRIEVER at her side.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes Donna, I’m out the door.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Just inform Kayleigh that anesthesia is on
the way to prep the epidural and I’ll be there as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: And promise her she’s about to have a
woooonnderful labor.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Right, I’ll see you in twenty.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Buenas dias, Rosario.</p>
<p><strong>rosario</strong>: Good morning Miss Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Honey? Honey, wake up. Pick up the-</p>
<p><strong>lead gunman</strong>: Get away from there! Don’t touch that –
!!</p>
<p><strong>lead gunman</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Where is who?</p>
<p><strong>lead gunman</strong>: Wrong answer.</p>
<p><strong>lead gunman</strong>: Search the house.</p>
<p><strong>craig vo</strong>: -I’ll call back later.</p>
<p><strong>ext. kidnappers’ safehouse - day</strong>: The BLACKNESS of a
BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us. We quickly CRANE DOWN to see
the vehicles traveling through: An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned
property. They bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren
trees–</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: THE KIDNAPPERS’ VAN as it arrives at its
destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is dead. The
trees are dead. It’s the kind of place you could scream for a week and
no one would hear a thing. As the van stops–</p>
<p><strong>int. darkened attic - kidnappers’ safehouse</strong>: A door
CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing the dusty,
skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the room and falls to the
floor. With bound hands, she frantically pulls her blindfold off to
see–</p>
<p><strong>the lead ski-masked kidnapper</strong>: Standing in front of
her. Sturdier than the rest. Solid. Imposing.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Wh… what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No, wait..</p>
<p><strong>no! please–//</strong>: SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden
beam an inch above Jessica’s head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL
TELEPHONE that hung there. As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead
Kidnapper turns and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and
locking Jessica in the darkness. Only now that they’re gone does Jessica
allow her fear to show through. Trembling, tears running down her face,
Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic–</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Wha… what the hell is happening?!</p>
<p><strong>the ocean</strong>: Skimming along the water. And we TILT UP
to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern California, and at the center
of it all, the SANTA MONICA</p>
<p><strong>ext. santa monica pier - morning - establishing</strong>: It
would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are preparing for a
“HEAL THE BAY” rally at the end of the pier. VENDORS set up, preparing
for the daily grind ahead. BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2
CONFEDERATE MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design. HOT CHICKS in
bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand. FISHERMEN crack beers while
awaiting the next bite.</p>
<p><strong>angle on - arcade game screen.</strong>: The screen displays
a car-race arcade game. A computer generated hot-rod passes other racers
at breakneck speed. Playing the sit-down game, DAYTONA USA, is: RYAN
ACKERMAN, early twenties, looks like he grew up on the beach without so
much as a pot to piss in. His lethal reflexes and bold recklessness,
however, have made him a Jedi Master of the game. Ryan’s score
approaches the HIGH SCORE at the top of the screen.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You recording this?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Yeah, sure…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Move, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Get that?</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Check it; Attack of the Bubblegum Monster in
Hi-Def videostream-</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: C’mon Chad, I gotta put my mouth on that.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Sweet. It’s going to my email right now.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Watch it dude, I gotta return that thing in
seven days.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: They aren’t giving you shit yet?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Nah, whenever I return it, I just list off why
the phone sucks and they give me a new model. Figure by the tenth time
I’ll have to go somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>the ocean</strong>: As seen looking over the rail of the
pier. The tide is in, but it’s still a forty foot drop.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Go already. No one’s looking.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Need me to hold that?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Waterproof.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: This is stupid. I could get killed. Pick
another dare.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: My ass. Not after you made me march in the Gay
Pride Parade wearing a thong.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Screw it then. In one… Two… Two and a
half–</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Whole numbers only, Rabbitfoot.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Just so you know, I’m emailing this to every
chick you ever met.</p>
<p><strong>chad</strong>: Transmitting pussy file now.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Got any more? I’m here to help.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Thanks, but no, we got ’em all.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What’s in ’em?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Cool, you’re handing these out during the
concert?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Yeah, wanna help?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hell yeah. I’m all about “Heal the Bay.”</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Me an Chad do the monthly cleanup thing, of
course…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: We’ve collected water samples with the Stream
Team, raised money on the Promenade… I’m surprised I haven’t seen
you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Chloe.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: I can’t tell if you’re full of it.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You ever go up to Santa Barbara? My dad used
to take me there all</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: the time. Their pier is amazing, clear water,
huge crabs everywhere, oysters right there on the rocks, starfish… Hard
to believe it’s the same ocean sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Maybe you and I can take a break later when
Pat Benatar goes on.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sounds like a plan.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Oh no – I forgot. I still have to pick up a
box of T-shirts at the Kinkos on Venice.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’ll do it for you… if you want.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Seriously, you would?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sure. How much is the bill?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Nothing. It’s been paid up front.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Do you promise not to go anywhere?</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Okay, I won’t be long.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Dude, does Santa Barbara have a harbor or a
pier?</p>
<p><strong>ext. venice - day</strong>: A short time later, Ryan cruises
through a Venice neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Dex, wassup? You won’t believe the hotties I
just met at the pier. Smoking. You wanna meet them? Yeah? Well don’t get
too excited ’cause I need my money.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Bullshit, you’re not going anywhere, I’m
pulling up right now.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What? Yeah, you better be. And I need your
shower, I’m talkin’ code red stankage-</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Dex? You still there…?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>ext. highway overpass - moments later 10</strong>: As traffic
resumes and Ryan clears the overpass–</p>
<p><strong>sfx: the cellphone rings.</strong>: Ryan picks up the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sorry, got cut off. Hey – what’s my Caller ID
say?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yo Dex…?</p>
<p><strong>ecu - a tangle of phone wires</strong>: 12 Their insulation
picked off and spliced together. PAN ALONG 12</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>13 int. ford bronco - continuous 13</strong>: With still no
answer, Ryan pulls the phone from his ear –</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Whatever. Signing off-</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Wait! Don’t hang up!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: There’s not much time! I need you to go to
the police. My name is Jessica Martin; I’ve been kidnapped!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh really? Kidnapped, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please. I know what you’re thinking, but
it’s real! I’m in an attic somewhere. I think they’re going to kill me!
You need to-</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Awfully polite kidnappers to give you a
phone…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No! You don’t understand!</p>
<p><strong>14 insert shot - the cellphone 14</strong>: The LCD reads:
CALL WAITING. ACCEPT?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: If you were really in trouble, you would’ve
called the cops, not me. Now I’ve got a real call on the other line–</p>
<p><strong>16 int. attic 16</strong>: A WIDER SHOT so we see Jessica’s
bound hands. Her bruised face. Whispering frantically into the
DEMOLISHED TELEPHONE she’s JERI-RIGGING back together as she talks.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Goddamn it, listen to me! The phone I’m
on…it’s shattered! There’s no dialer! I’ve been clicking wires together
for hours trying to get someone, anyone, and you ’re the only connection
I was able to make! If you hang up, I may not get anyone else.</p>
<p><strong>17 intercut call - ryan in ford bronco/jessica bound in attic
17</strong>: SFX: Ryan’s call waiting BLIPS again. He considers
everything Jessica has said, then:</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hmm. Sucks to be you. Try crank yanking
someone else. Late.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Wait! Don’t hang up! DON’T HANG UP!!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Dex?</p>
<p><strong>18 int. telemarket bullpen - day 18</strong>: A TELEMARKETER
checks Ryan’s name on a list, then glances at the script.</p>
<p><strong>telemarketer</strong>: Hello, Mr. Ackerman. My name is Mark
and I’d like to discuss with you the benefits of Mastercharge Credit
Union’s-</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Awesome, I can totally use a credit card. Tell
me more.</p>
<p><strong>telemarketer</strong>: Absolutely. We’ve lowered our APR-</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: -Shucks, now’s really not a good time, but why
don’t I get your number and get back to you later.</p>
<p><strong>telemarketer</strong>: Sure, it’s 818…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: That’s the office number?</p>
<p><strong>telemarketer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Why don’t you give me your number instead.
That way I can call you when you’re having dinner with your family.</p>
<p><strong>telemarketer</strong>: Sorry to have bothered you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Damn skippy.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: –an you hear me?!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You still there? You’re getting kinda creepy,
lady. See ya.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No! Don’t! They’re going to kill me!
They’re going to kill me!!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh, it’s like that, huh? Nice with the fake
tears, lady…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please… I just need help.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You need acting lessons. Now go take your meds
and bug someone else.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: These men!!!–</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: These men killed my housekeeper. My dog.
You have to help me.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, actually hot chick waiting for me at the
pier.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please…you’re my only hope. What’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Why, you writing a book–?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: –Please, just tell me your name!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Uh…Johnny. Johnny Fountain.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Johnny… What if it was your mother who was
calling for help? How would you feel?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Well, I’d be damn impressed, considering she’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Goddamn it, how difficult is it to hand
this phone off to the police?! I’ll pay you!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Five thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sure you will. I’m hanging up now.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No, wait! WAIT!! Even if there’s a eighty
percent chance I’m lying, you nave a one in five chance to make five
grand f9r a lousy twenty minutes of your life. Haven’t you ever bet on a
horse or bought a Lottery ticket? I’m talking one-in-five odds, twenty
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>someone’s pov.</strong>: In EXTREME SLOW-MOTION, chaos
unfolds around us like a nightmare – OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward
the back, a HOOKER screams at us with unholy rage, in the far corner, a
JUNKIE spits on</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: BOB MOONEY’S EYES. Concerned, but not
panicked. MOONEY’S POV. Still surreal, SLOW-MOTION, as an Officer with a
CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkie’s face into a wall, legal but
hard.</p>
<p><strong>sfx</strong>: A HEARTBEAT. OURS. FAST… And possibly
IRREGULAR? CLOSE UP - SLOW MOTION - The RIGHT THUMB presses into the</p>
<p><strong>left wrist.</strong>: MOONEY’S EYES. Watching. Counting…
Suddenly – WHAM!! Back to reality when a YOUNG GANGBANGER is slammed
into the station desk by a ROOKIE.</p>
<p><strong>rookie officer</strong>: Problem, Mooney. If I put this one
in with the others, there’s gonna be a bloodbath.</p>
<p><strong>gangbanger</strong>: Put me in there! I’ll waste all them
pussies!</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Come on Powell, put the Sharks with the
Sharks, the Jets with the Jets and make room.</p>
<p><strong>21 on the television 21</strong>: a NEWS REPORTER is in the
middle of a segment. Over him, FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops
testifying in court; being led away in handcuffs.</p>
<p><strong>news reporter</strong>: …was somber when the indictments came
down this afternoon in the 23rd Precinct corruption scandal. Though the
names of six police officers were read aloud, the District Attorney
stated that this was merely the “tip of the iceberg” and that
unfortunately many other arrests are likely to be coming as the
investigations proceed.</p>
<p><strong>’2 back to police station 22</strong>: As DETECTIVE JACK
TOMLIN passes Mooney, he nods toward the TV.</p>
<p><strong>detective tomlin</strong>: Sucks for the fellas at the Two-
Three right now, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Dirty pricks deserve what they get. Public
hates us enough without this shit.</p>
<p><strong>detective tomlin</strong>: There’s good men over there.</p>
<p><strong>female officer</strong>: Mooney? What are you doing? You
can’t be eating this crap.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Keep walking, Shelly. Nothing to see
here.</p>
<p><strong>female officer</strong>: You sure you wanna do that? What
would your wife say?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: She’d say nothing, ’cause she’s not gonna
know about it! Christ, Shel, my old man had eleven heart attacks.
Eleven! I have one little infarction and you guys start treating me like
an invalid! I’m a grown man! Leave me alone, will you?!</p>
<p><strong>female officer</strong>: I was merely referring to your
cottage-cheese ass.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: I hate this place.</p>
<p><strong>23 ext. 15th precinct - continuous 23</strong>: The Ford
Bronco roars up; snags the handicapped spot. Ryan hops out and limps
theatrically the first few steps until he’s far enough away from the car
to start running.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>24 int. 15th precinct - continuous 24</strong>: Cops try to
wrangle the dozens of shouting GANG MEMBERS who cram the Station Desk,
waiting to be booked. Ryan takes a deep breath and shoves his way
through the mayhem to the extremely shorthanded Station Desk where:</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: is busy doing ten things at once. Signing
release papers. Booking a DRUNK whose wife-beater Tee is drenched in
blood, Etc.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Excuse me, officer –</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey, I’ve got an emergency here –</p>
<p><strong>crackhead trannie</strong>: Loosen these, man, please?! Jus’
gimme a chance–</p>
<p><strong>crewcut officer</strong>: Hey, Moon! Where do you want me to
put Whitney Houston?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Christ, I’ve only got two hands here! Stick
him in the can, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Come on, man! I’ve got some lady on the phone
here who says she’s been kidnapped!</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Nice try, kid, but I got no time for
pranks.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Seriously, a lady was murdered!</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Which is it, a kidnapping or a murder?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Take the phone and find out moron!</p>
<p><strong>25 int. kidnappers’ attic 25</strong>: Jessica holds her
breath. She stares apprehensively at the attic door, praying for Mooney
to just take the damn phone.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please. . .</p>
<p><strong>6 back to police station 26</strong>: Ryan looks sincere.
Mooney deliberates, then sighs.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Okay. Give it here.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh thank God! You’ve got to help me. My
name’s Jessica Martin and I’ve been kidnapped. This morning five men
broke into my home in Brentwood and kidnapped–</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Ah shit.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Hurry kid, take this upstairs to
Robbery/Homicide and ask for Detective Tomlin.</p>
<p><strong>27 int. kidnappers’ attic 27</strong>: Jessica hears the
phone being shuffled around.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Hello? Officer? Hello?!</p>
<p><strong>28 back to police station 28</strong>: Mooney, recognizing an
emergency when he hears one, ignores the incoming CROWD him long enough
to assist Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Up the stairs, Tomlin!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>29 int. kidnappers’ attic 29</strong>: Jessica hears:</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Lady, what’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>lead kidnapper</strong>: Where’s your husband?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What? I don’t-</p>
<p><strong>lead kidnapper</strong>: Where is he!?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: At work! Why, what do you want–?</p>
<p><strong>30 ryan - in the police station stairwell 30</strong>: Phone
to his ear. Wide-eyed. Hearing it all. For the first time, starting to
believe Jessica’s story.</p>

out at 1:45.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Good, then if I get a cop–</p>

sheets giving the entire place a creepy, haunted feel. FOLLOW the LEAD
KIDNAPPER as he descends a nearby stairwell and pulls off his mask–</p>
<p><strong>reveal greer</strong>: Forties, salt and pepper hair. He
looks to his crew:</p>

<p><strong>jessica</strong>: How should I know?!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What do you do?</p>

<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What–? No!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Then he won’t go anywhere with strangers.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Unless they have our Escalade. Ricky’11

<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Like you don’t remember the lunch box? Or
anything else about your kid– Oh, man. This is a prank, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Bullshit! Oh, you’re good lady. Your friends
too. Getting me to scream out ‘Ricky Martin’ at a boys school. Damn, you
really nailed me.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No–</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No, Johnny, you have to listen to me–

<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m done being your entertainment for the day.
I’m going back to the pier while I still have a chance –</p>
<p><strong>gym teacher</strong>: Here he is! He’s the one that’s been
stalking the students.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Stalking?! No, I can explain–</p>
<p><strong>rent-a-cop #1</strong>: Okay, we got him. We’re at the front
of the school. Sir, come with us.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE–!! Hang on a sec! This is
a huuuge misunderstanding–</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Lord of the Rings! I forgot his father
bought him a Lord of the Rings lunchbox last week!</p>
<p><strong>ricky martin!!</strong>: The Boy opens the car door…but turns
as he hears his name called. For the briefest moment, Ricky and Ryan
lock eyes–</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh shit! You just see that?!</p>
<p><strong>rent-a-cop #1</strong>: Roy, some help over here!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Goddamn it, that little kid was just
kidnapped!! Do something!!</p>
<p><strong>rent-a-cop #1</strong>: Roy–! !</p>
<p><strong>hey–! !</strong>: They chase after him, but Ryan hops over
the hood of the idling RENT-A-COP CAR and throws himself into its
driver’s seat. Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs
Ryan’s collar – and is dragged twenty feet as Ryan throws the little car
in gear and burns away.</p>
<p><strong>39 int. rent-a-cop car - racing down a residential street
39</strong>: Trying to catch the Escalade, a quarter-mile ahead. Ryan
feels completely conspicuous in the security car as he slaloms through
the streets of East Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’s happening, Ryan?!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Don’t worry, I can fix this.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s okay, I can see them ahead.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Don’t lose them! If you follow them back
here, you can tell the police where they’re holding us!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. the kidnappers’ escalade 40</strong>: The mountainous
Deason drives as Ellis sits shotgun. In the back sits Jessica’s son,
RICKY; who eyes the two men suspiciously. CCR plays on the RADIO. Ellis,
turns down the radio. Faking sincerity, he turns to face Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Do you want me to change the station to
something else?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Yeah. I like Creedence too.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Where’s Rosario?</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: I told you, kid, she had a doctor’s
appointment, so your mother asked us to pick you up. Don’t worry, you’ll
see your mommy in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. rent-a-cop car 41</strong>: Cautiously, so as not to
give himself away, Ryan PASSES one commuter car. Then the next.
Narrowing the gap between the rent-a-cop car and the Escalade to one
last auto. It takes Ryan literally standing on the gas pedal to get up
enough speed to get around the final car. Now the Escalade is dead
ahead. Ryan begins gently closing the distance between them, and is just
starting to relax, when–</p>
<p><strong>a city bus</strong>: merges into traffic from a Bus Stop
right ahead of him!</p>
<p><strong>shit!</strong>: Ryan SLAMS on his breaks and is forced to
crawl along at a</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Johnny!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Damn! There’s this stupid bus–</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Jesus.’</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Can’t you go around it?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Goddamn it!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What?! Did you lose him? !</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, I just almost got killed, is all.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh thank God!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Thank God? That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey, here we go!</p>
<p><strong>son- of- a– ii</strong>: Ryan SLAMS on the brakes, SWERVES
HARD to avoid a collision – and loses cont rol of the car! The
rent-a-cop car goes POWER SLIDING across oncoming traffic, HORNS BLARING
AT HIM and heads straight for a the FLOOR TO CEILING WINDOW of a CAR</p>
<p><strong>42 int. car dealership 42</strong>: SMASH!!! The car goes
through the window and RACES down the center aisle. CAR SALESMEN and
PATRONS are forced to dive out of the way as the rent-a-cop car MOWS
DOWN DISPLAYS and everything else in its path.</p>
<p><strong>43 int. the kidnappers’ escalade 43</strong>: The mountainous
Deason drives. In back, Ellis sits with Jessica’s son, RICKY, who eyes
the two men suspiciously. CREEDENCE CLEARWATER REVIVAL plays on the
RADIO.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Anyone following us?</p>
<p><strong>the rearview mirror</strong>: We see the bus about five car
lengths behind, but the rent-a- cop car is nowhere to be seen. Deason
flashes an evil grin.</p>
<p><strong>deason</strong>: Nan.</p>
<p><strong>44 ext. car dealership 44</strong>: The rent-a-cop car exits
the dealership, SMASHING through another GLASS WINDOW! Ryan quickly
regains control of the car and steers it back on the street. Only to
find that the Escalade has disappeared!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’s happening?! Are you okay?!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What?! Yo u lost–</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No, No! just give me a second–</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Jesus! Where the hell did they go?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Jessica, I–</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You let them get away.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: j INT. 15TH PRECINCT - LOCKER ROOM -
DAY 45</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: – so of course everyone’s playing dumb to
what kind of drugs he’s on.</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: So I start searching the place. I’m about
to open a closet door when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out of the
bathroom. He shoots. Misses me and hits one of the E.M.T’s. Fires again,
but the gun jams and BAM! Blows half his face off. Had enough black tar
heroin in the closet to resurface the 405.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: It must’ve been around ’84, when…</p>
<p><strong>cop two</strong>: Sorry Moon, we’re late for a briefing.</p>
<p><strong>deep male voice</strong>: I’ll bet in your day you had some
stories.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Hey Tomlin.</p>
<p><strong>detective tomlin</strong>: Taking off?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: My anniversary. You know, duty calls; pricey
dinner and then some crap-ass play. Hey, I sent some college kid down to
see you this morning. Had some rap about a kidnapping –</p>
<p><strong>detective tomlin</strong>: I haven’t seen anyone, but I’ll
ask around. Kidnapping, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: I thought it was a prank at first, but the
kid was so worked up–</p>
<p><strong>detective tomlin</strong>: Well, don’t you get worked up. If
the kid comes back, page me, and I’ll be sure to see him.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>46 int. rent-a-cop car - chugging through west l.a.
46</strong>: Ryan lead-foots the gas. The speedometer climbs. Forty.
Fifty. Sixty miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Look, Johnny, you’ve got to go back to the
cops–</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Are you high?! I just jacked a car!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Goddamn it, stop thinking about just
yourself! You can explain everything to them later!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>insert shot - cellphone face plate</strong>: The BATTERY
INDICATOR is flashing: LOW BATT. LOW BATT.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Great! Now the battery’s dying.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Don’t you have a charger?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s in my car! Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>sfx</strong>: BEEP-BEEP! The battery indicator has lost
another bar. Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens
the glovebox and – a snub-nosed .38 SPECIAL tumbles out.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Jesus – !</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’s going on? Did you find one?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Not exactly…</p>
<p><strong>sfx</strong>: BEEP-BEEP!! Jessica starts growing afraid.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Johnny, don’t lose me!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Well what the hell do you expect me to
do?!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Johnny–!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I know, Jessica!</p>
<p><strong>sfx: beep-beep-beep…‘.’</strong>: Ryan’s got to do something.
Now.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You know that money you promised me?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m giving myself a raise.</p>
<p><strong>47 ext. verizon mall hill - continuous 47</strong>: And with
that, Ryan CRANKS the steering wheel hard right and HITS THE GAS!
Despite other drivers’ protests, the little Rent-a-Cop vehicle blasts
across the gridlock, TEARS through the rusty GUARD RAIL and – VROOOOM! –
flies off the side of the hill! Ryan lets out a frightened yell as he
SAILS through the clear blue sky.</p>
<p><strong>hoooollyyy shiiii–</strong>: THUMP! The Rent-a-Cop car
touches down on a steep downslope. Ryan struggles to control the bucking
automobile, miraculously avoiding the minefield of ROCKS and TREE
STUMPS. He needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its
antenna in his teeth. There’s so much noise, the only thing Jessica
could possibly hear is a CACOPHONY OF NOISE and Ryan
HYPERVENTILATING.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’s going on?!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: mmmrrmph mrm mrmph!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>whoaaaaaa!</strong>: Ryan whips the wheel and navigates the
little car between the billboard’s concrete posts, but – WHAM! –
obliterates the rent-a-cop’s BUBBLE LIGHTS on the billboard’s lower
edge. Somehow, Ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the rest of
the hill and into the strip mall parking lot, where it SKIDS OUT.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Jessica?! Can you hear me?!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’m here!</p>
<p><strong>48 the verizon wireless store - continuous 48</strong>: And
of course, they’re having a sale and the place is packed. Every
SALESPERSON is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>sfx: beep-beep-beep!!</strong>: Panicking, Ryan pushes his
way to the front of the counter –</p>
<p><strong>irate customers</strong>: Hey, what do you think you’re
doing? There’s a line!</p>
<p><strong>overly-perky salesman</strong>: ..and if you get the new
Nokia 9200, you can switch out faceplates to match your mood! And we
have a special today on tiger stripes… Are you feeling fierce?</p>
<p><strong>easily-excitable customer</strong>: Oh, how fun!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Excuse me–</p>
<p><strong>overly-perky salesman</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, I’m with a
customer now.</p>
<p><strong>overly-perky salesman</strong>: But if you take a number,
someone will be with you shortly.</p>
<p><strong>sfx: beep-beep-beep!i</strong>: Just then, a BUSY SALESWOMAN
walks by. Ryan grabs her.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey! Hey! I’ve got an emergency here –</p>
<p><strong>busy saleswoman</strong>: Sorry, I’m on break–</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Damn it, will you listen to me?! I’ve got a
life and death call on this phone and my battery’s dying! Do you have a
charger?</p>
<p><strong>busy salesman</strong>: Sure. Take a number and one of the
sales associates will grab you one when your turn comes up.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Bu t– !</p>
<p><strong>sfx: beep-beep-beep-beep!!!</strong>: Ryan breaks out in a
cold sweat. Can’t catch his breath. As a SALESWOMAN rushes by, Ryan
reaches for her.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Help, I –</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: Take a number.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Aw, screw this…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh look! Now serving thirty eight special!</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Hi, honey. Yeah, I’m gonna be a few minutes
late…</p>
<p><strong>50 int. jessica’s living room - day 50</strong>: We PAN PAST
PHOTOGRAPHS of Jessica’s family over to- AN ANSWERING MACHINE RINGS…
ANSWERS. We hear Jessica’s outgoing message, then a BEEP and-</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Jessica? Damn, where are you? I called
earlier and… Jess, I’m in serious trouble. I can’t explain right now,
but we’re all in danger. Please, just grab Ricky and meet me in left
field.</p>
<p><strong>51 int. rent-a-cop car - racing off through the city
51</strong>: Just as the phone literally dies – Ryan rips a new CHARGER
from its packaging, slaps it into the phone and voila, it begins
CHARGING.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Whew! That was so no bueno!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You found a charger?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Among other things…</p>
<p><strong>52 intercut call - ryan in car/jessica in attic 52</strong>:
Ryan fiddles with the now war-torn phone.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Thank you for doing all this, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Yeah, look, about that… My-name isn’t really
Johnny Fountain.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Good, it sounded like a porn star name.
It’s okay. I know. You don’t have to tell me –</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s Ryan. Ryan Ackerman. I’m a bar-back. I’m
twenty-two, and just a little freaked out right now.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Thank you, Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>sfx: feet on the stairs - coming toward the attic!</strong>:
Jessica JUMPS with a start. Tries to push the PHONE GUTS behind a beam
with her foot as Greer enters – but fails. The receiver sits in front of
the beam, EXPOSED! Greer crosses the room and sits on a box next to
Jessica. He stares at her for long, uncomfortable moments. Then:</p>
<p><strong>greek</strong>: Do you want to die here?</p>
<p><strong>53 ryan - in the rent-a-cop car 53</strong>: Slams on the
brakes and skids up to the curb. Covers the mouthpiece.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>54 back to attic 54</strong>: Greer’s question still hangs in
the air.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: N-no…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: …but I am going to, aren’t I?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Up to you. Your husband left a message asking
you to meet him in left field. Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What? I don’t understand–?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: –A base ball field !? Wh ich o ne does he
mean?!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I… I don’t know what you want me to say. I
swear–</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Shut up!!! Which field?! He wouldn’t leave a
message that didn’t make sense to you!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Wait! The bleachers behind left field at
Dodger Stadium! That’s where we first met.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please! Believe me. That has to be where he
means. I swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Working in my profession as long as I have,
you begin to recognize the truth when you hear it.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Go to the window, Jessica. There’s something
I want you to see.</p>
<p><strong>55 jessica’s pov - the yard below 55</strong>: Down in the
yard below, Jessica’s eleven-year-old son Ricky stands uncomfortably in
the middle of a basketball half-court as one of the kidnappers stands
nearby, watching.</p>
<p><strong>56 int. attic 56</strong>: Jessica’s knees nearly buckle.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Ricky!</p>
<p><strong>57 ext. the yard below 57</strong>: Hodges looks up and sees
Jessica’s face in the window. Then turns and tosses a basketball to
Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>hodges</strong>: Shoot hoops.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I.. I don’t feel like it.</p>
<p><strong>hodges</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>58 int. attic 58</strong>: Jessica sees her son start
shooting the ball – completely oblivious to Hodges, who flicks open his
coat, revealing SILENCED PISTOL tucked into his waistband.</p>
<p><strong>greek</strong>: You have three seconds to tell me where he
really is or you’re going to a funeral.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. the rent-a-cop car 59</strong>: Ryan’s listening.
Helpless. There’s nothing he can do.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus!!</p>
<p><strong>60 int. attic / ext. safehouse 60</strong>: Jessica drains
ghost-white. On the verge of passing out. Down below, Ricky shoots
baskets, unaware of Hodges closing his hand around his gun.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: One.. .</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please! Please, believe me!</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please, he’s just a child!</p>
<p><strong>61 int. rent-a-cop car 61</strong>: Ryan is more frenzied

retrieve a high rebound. Jessica watches in horror as Hodges begins to
slowly DRAW HIS GUN.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No…no.’ I swear that’s all I know!</p>
<p><strong>greek</strong>: Thre–</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: OKAY! … okay… LAX Airport! There’s a bar
called Left Field. That’s where we met. We were in college on our way to
Mardi-gras.</p>
<p><strong>63 int. rent-a-cop car 63</strong>: Ryan’s completely floored
by Jessica’s admission. She knew all along?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Please God, I swear that’s the truth. Don’t
kill my son!</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Most people don’t get past two.</p>
<p><strong>.-�&gt; ext. safehouse - day 65</strong>: Hodges tucks his
gun away…just as Ricky turns around. The kid startles that Hodges was so
close.</p>
<p><strong>hodges</strong>: Okay, kid. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>66 int. attic - continuous 66</strong>: Jessica watches as
her son is led away to the GUEST HOUSE across the yard. Once he’s inside
and out of view, Jessica collapses in a heap on the floor. Greer is
about to exit the attic – when Jessica speaks.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You won’t get away with this. When I didn’t
show up at the hospital, someone must have called the police–</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: The police are the last people on earth I’m
worried about…</p>
<p><strong>^7 ryan - sitting in the rent-a-cop car 67</strong>:
listening to the call with every fiber of his being.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: We get one hit on the scanner about you,
we’ll be picking out family plots, comprende?</p>
<p><strong>68 the attic 68</strong>: Jessica hears it first. The pumping
cacophony coming from the phone behind the beam. It’s subtle at first,
but grows increasingly louder. She closes her eyes, praying Greer won’t
hear it– But Greer does hear it. On the verge of leaving the room, Greer
stops. Cocks an ear. Instantly, Jessica tries to cover it with her own
voice.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Do you honestly expect me to believe we’re
going to walk away from this alive?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>69 ryan - in the rent-a-cop car 69</strong>: Oblivious of
Jessica desperately trying to clue him in.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: How can I SHUT UP? You threaten to kill my
child and you expect me to act like a MUTE?! If this –</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Oh shit! Where’s mute?!</p>
<p><strong>essica</strong>: …your child, then–</p>
<p><strong>71 int. rent a cop car - continuous 71</strong>: Ryan finds
the MUTE BUTTON. Presses it and–</p>
<p><strong>72 int. attic - continuous 72</strong>: Greer listens
intently… and HEARS NOTHING but silence in the still attic. Soon, he
turns to leave. Only when he’s gone does Jessica’s heart start beating
again.</p>
<p><strong>73 int. rent a cop car 73</strong>: The HUMMER finally pulls
away.</p>
<p><strong>” if they could</strong>: they would …</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: x - �&gt;</p>
<p><strong>1 int. kidnappers’ safehouse - hallway outside attic

his mask.</p>

<p><strong>ellis</strong>: Are you positive?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Tell Hodges we move in ten.</p>
<p><strong>75 int. attic 75</strong>: Jessica lies on the floor, sobbing
into her knees. Soft as an insect’s buzz, we can hear Ryan calling to
her on the broken phone.</p>

<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Do you think I like gambling with my son’s
life?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I can’t tell. You seem pretty good at it –</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Don’t you see, Ryan? Once they get Craig,
we’re all gonna die.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You can’t know that for sure.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Be realistic. Does letting us live benefit
them in any way? No! The only chance he’s got is if you can get to the
airport and find him before they do.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Wait, wait–!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Ryan, please! There’s no time! Just get to
the airport–</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It’s suicide. They’ll kill me!</p>
<p><strong>j… jessica</strong>: They won’t! You’re invisible to them!
They don’t know who you are. They don’t know anything about you. Please!
You’ve got to try!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Lady, I’ve jacked two cars, been accused of
being a child molester, obliterated a car dealership, and busted three
caps in a Verizon store. – Don’t tell me I’m not trying!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Look, I have no right to ask you this Ryan,
but you re my family’s only chance…and I am asking.</p>

gotta be it, okay?!</p>

<p><strong>attractive woman</strong>: It’s Bayback. Remember the Fusco
brothers?</p>
<p><strong>attractive woman</strong>: Well, I’ve got an itch that needs

<p><strong>ecu - the man on the other end of the call</strong>: Too

<p><strong>si intercut phone call - ryan in rent-a-cop car/jessica in
attics 1</strong>: Jessica’s voice trails off as she catches a glimp se
of herself in an OLD MIRROR standing in the corner. Bruised. Clothes
torn. Staring at her own cracked reflect ion, she breaks down, but
silently this time, locked in he r own personal hell. For Ryan, the
silence is deafening. Despite his frantic driving, he feels her pain.
And hates being unable to help.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Jessica… ?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Do you think God will forgive me?</p>

in a typical LA celebrity sighting, turns out to be none other than
SIMON COWELL, host of American Idol. Simon continues his

<p><strong>110 ext. surface streets - day 110</strong>: As Ryan huffs
and puffs toward the building, he sees a BIKE MESSENGER bullshitting
with a HOT DOG VENDOR. Ryan stops and stares at the PACKAGE POUCH on the
seat and a flashy red BIKE HELMET hanging on the handlebars. The helmet
is futuristic, like something The Flash might wear. Ryan eyes the
Messenger, grabs the bike, hops on and peddles for dear life toward
Craig’s building with the Messenger hot on his heels.</p>
<p><strong>111 ext. fegan securities, inc. building 111</strong>: As
Ryan arrives at the building, the Escalade pulls up in front of him and

<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I have an idea…</p>
<p><strong>113 int. mooney’s bedroom - day 113</strong>: Mooney , lies

She puts on makeup.</p>
<p><strong>marilyn</strong>: In five minutes, I’ll need you to give me a
hand.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Whenever you’re ready, hon.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: …and authorities are now asking your

the bike helmet now strapped to his head and the pouch over his shoulder
– just as the ELEVATOR ARRIVES behind him! As Greer, Hodges and Craig
get out, Ryan turns and searches for the mailroom that’s supposed to be
here! Where the hell is– Ah I He finds it and hustles into –</p>
<p><strong>116 int. mailroom - continuous 116</strong>: A wide COUNTER
separates Ryan and a few BUSINESS MEN and WOMEN from the MAIL CLERKS
that busily work the other side. Ryan leans against the wall, pretending
to be an ordinary bike messenger waiting for a package as Craig and the
dirty cops enter, brushing right past him. Craig scans the faces of the
other patrons as they enter, desperately trying to figure out who is his
secret ally. He ignores Ryan completely, whose face is mostly hidden by
the tinted plastic VISOR attached to the helmet. Craig notices an AGING
SECURITY GUARD stationed in the area, but knows better than to make any
waves.</p>
<p><strong>mailroom supervisor</strong>: Anything I can help you with
Mr. Martin?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hey, Benny. This might sound ridiculous, but
I dropped a DVD mailer into the chute this morning and I forgot to put
down an address.</p>
<p><strong>mailroom supervisor</strong>: Happens all the time. Let me
see what’s back there. Gimme a sec’.</p>
<p><strong>mail clerk ,</strong>: Excuse me, sir? Sir? Sir?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>mail clerk</strong>: You waiting for a package?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sure, uh… I’m supposed to pick something up
for Mr. Fountain over at the Bonaventure.</p>
<p><strong>mail clerk</strong>: From what department?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I’m not sure… They said it was a contract,
though, I know that, so what would that be, Legal?</p>
<p><strong>mail clerk</strong>: What’s the tracking number?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Uh… Right. Tracking number.</p>
<p><strong>mailroom supervisor</strong>: Mr. Martin? I found a number of
things that could be what you’re looking for. Mind coming back to take a
look?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I might… Maybe it’s on the clipboard on my
bike?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I, uh, may need to call somebody.</p>
<p><strong>117 int. mailroom - back room 117</strong>: There’s an entire
shelf that serves as a dead letter office. One plastic bin is filled
with reusable interoffice envelopes, another bin is overflowing with
small mailers, computer disks, unlabeled video tapes, Etc…</p>
<p><strong>mailroom supervisor</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>hodges</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>118 int. mailroom - continuous 118</strong>: Ryan now sits by
the window, cellphone pressed to his ear. Feigning frustration.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: You believe this? Everyone’s got their head up
their ass over there.</p>
<p><strong>mail clerk</strong>: Sir? You think you could just go outside
and get your clipboard?</p>
<p><strong>mail clerk</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>mail clerk</strong>: Sir!?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Screw the package.</p>
<p><strong>what are you doing–?!</strong>: – swings it full-force into
Hodges’ face – WHAMM!! Hodges drops like a slaughterhouse cow.
Instantly, employees hit the ground; scream; run for their lives. Craig
dives for the DVD case. The Security Guard has come to life; drawing
down on them.</p>
<p><strong>freeze!</strong>: Craig does. But Ryan grabs him and moves,
racing out of the bank.</p>
<p><strong>119 int. hallway - outside mailroom - continuous
119</strong>: At the end of the hall, GREER sees Craig and Ryan running
out of the mailroom. Drops his phone, draws his gun –</p>
<p><strong>freeze!!</strong>: – just as the Guard comes running out. His
gun was fixed on Ryan, but now that he sees Greer with a piece, he
trains his gun on him instead.</p>
<p><strong>drop your weapon!</strong>: Ryan and Craig are struck in the
middle of the crossfire.</p>
<p><strong>drop it now!!</strong>: The instant Ryan and Craig try to
escape into a nearby stairwell – Greer turns his gun on the SECURITY
GUARD –</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: ..run…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: ..ruuuUUUUNNNNNN!!</p>
<p><strong>120 int. stairwell - day 120</strong>: He starts flying down
the stairs…but when he sees four BUILDING SECURITY GUARDS racing up from
below–</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>121 int. mailroom - day 121</strong>: Hodges gets to his
feet. Stumbles out, holding his gushing, broken nose. Yells at Greer,
who’s racing into the stairwell.</p>
<p><strong>hodges</strong>: The kid!!</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: No shit.</p>
<p><strong>122 int. stairwell - day 122</strong>: With the Guards and
Greer only a floor behind, Ryan thinks fast and CHUCKS HIS BIKE HELMET
down the corridor, ELBOWS the In-Case-Of-Emergency Glass, setting off
the FIRE ALARM – and starts running UP. Seconds later, when they reach
that level, one of the Guards sees Ryan’s helmet and the broken glass
leading away.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Sees Greer and Hodges coming. Big-ass guns out
and ready. Shit.’ THE ALARM BELLS SCREAM. PEOPLE start filling the
stairwell on every floor. Forcing his body to its very limits, Ryan
bolts up the stairs until he sees the ROOF EXIT on the next floor up. He
shoves open the nearest door and continues running up to the roof. He
slips out and silently closes the door behind him just as–</p>
<p><strong>123 int. stairwell - day 123</strong>: GREER and HODGES reach
the floor beneath. See the door swinging shut – but neither fall for the
bait. They runs up toward the-</p>
<p><strong>124 ext. roof - day 124</strong>: Ryan’s eyes SCAN the
rooftop. Construction is in progress up here; tarpapering. Huge ROLLS OF
TARPAPER lie about, PALATTES holding supplies covered with TARPS, an
industrial</p>
<p><strong>air conditioner…</strong>: Ryan quickly shoves a 2”x4” under
the doorknob to jam it. Heart pounding, he races to the building’s edge
and looks down. Nothing but a straight drop 60 feet down. Footsteps are
approaching! POUNDING on the door! Ryan darts behind a tarp-covered mass
of supplies just as –</p>
<p><strong>125 ext. roof - day 125</strong>: GREER shakes the 2”x4”
loose. He and Hodges explode out onto the roof, looking for Ryan. Greer
encircles the huge air-conditioner while Hodges hunts behind a large
SATELLITE DISH. No Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>the alarm stops.</strong>: Greer cocks his head in the sudden
eerie silence. The only sounds are INCOHERENT SCREAMS coming from the
stairwell. He eyes where the chute empties into the dumpster,
thinks…</p>
<p><strong>126 int. metal chute - continuous 126</strong>: RYAN, wedging
himself against the sides of the chute, tries to be as still as
possible. Every slight movement makes the</p>
<p><strong>aluminum buckle and groan.</strong>: From his shirt pocket,
Jessica’s tiny desperate voice pleads.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Ryan… ? Ryan, please answer me I</p>
<p><strong>127 ext. roof - continuous 127</strong>: Greer picks up a
large roll of tarpaper and starts lugging it toward the open mouth of
the chute…</p>
<p><strong>.28 int. metal chute - continuous 128</strong>: Ryan holds
his breath. Trembling. His leg threatening to rabbit-foot again.
Straining to hear Greer, it’s impossible not to hear:</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You have to talk to me! Ryan, please you
have to talk to me–.’</p>
<p><strong>129 int. attic 129</strong>: Jessica hears a loud SCRAAAAPE,
CRASH and a wash of STATIC.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Ryan?! OH MY GOD, RYAN?! RYAN–?!</p>
<p><strong>130 int. kidnappers’ safehouse - living room - same time
130</strong>: The hulking Deason hears Jessica’s PANICKED VOICE and
stands with a start. As he moves toward the attic, he notices a small
RED LIGHT FLASHING behind the bar. As he passes, he checks it out
and–</p>
<p><strong>what the–?!</strong>: WHIP PAN DOWN to what Deason sees: The
red light is on one of the house phones. The LINE-IN-USE INDICATOR. And
it’s lit. Shaking like a bear pissing pineapples, Deason rages away
toward the attic…</p>
<p><strong>131 int. attic - continuous 131</strong>: Jessica is curling
herself into a tiny sobbing ball on the floor when – WHAMM! – the attic
door crashes open. Jessica jumps. Deason looms there. Sees the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>you stupid bitch!</strong>: Jessica hurls the phone receiver
away.</p>
<p><strong>no, don ’t h urt m e–</strong>: Deason roars up and grabs
Jessica’s neck with one hand. HURLS her across the attic and into the
OLD MIRROR, shattering it in a million pieces around her. Desperate for
anything, Jessica PALMS a TINY SHARD as she struggles to her feet. A
two-inch chip.</p>
<p><strong>you and your kid are dead!</strong>: She lowers her arm,
defeated, out of breath… You win.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Don’t hurt me, and I’ll do anything…
Anything.. .</p>
<p><strong>deason</strong>: Oooh.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30 liters of
blood per minute…and there’s only five liters in the human body.</p>
<p><strong>132 int. trash chute - day 132</strong>: RYAN’S still
trapped. Sounds of approaching SIRENS in the distance. Ryan listens for
Greer; is he still there? BANG!! BANG!! Two more heavy TARPAPER ROLLS
come right at him! The first one he gets lucky with, but the second
NAILS HIM before bouncing furiously away and Ryan loses his grip
completely and slides out of control.</p>
<p><strong>133 ext. roof - day 133</strong>: GREER watches amazed when
Ryan actually tumbles out of the ass-end of the metal chute into the
dumpster. He drops the next roll of tarpaper ready to go and reaches for
his gun –</p>
<p><strong>-434 ext. inside djumpster - continuous 134</strong>: RYAN is
in serious pain. He frantically fishes through the refuse to find:</p>
<p><strong>simon cowell’s cellphone</strong>: Or rather, what’s left of
it: A million shattered pieces scattered everywhere. Ryan sifts through
the plastic debris as if he had secretly hoped he could still use it.
Yeah, right… He’s barely able to sit up when –</p>
<p><strong>blam!! blam!! blam!!</strong>: He ducks back down as bullets
ricochet off the steel dumpster. As SIRENS get louder, closer, Ryan’s
got to make his move – he jumps out of the dumpster, landing on his ass
on the opposite side of Greer.</p>
<p><strong>135 ext. roof - continuous 135</strong>: BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!!
Greer’s pistol is ill equipped for long- range shooting. The kid’s too
far away by now. He grabs his walkie –</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: The kid’s outside, headed toward the front of
the building–</p>
<p><strong>hodges</strong>: -Gotta go, boss. The Guard’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>cops</strong>: Who the hell’s shooting up here?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Sonofabitch shot the poor bastard right in
front of us!</p>
<p><strong>136 int. kidnappers’ safehouse - day 136</strong>: Jessica
races across the dead brown lawn toward the guest house/prison that
holds her son. Getting her first good look</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Baby! Are you okay?!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: I can’t get out!</p>
<p><strong>137 ext. the martin house - late afternoon 137</strong>: A
gold FORD TAURUS pulls up in front. The driver door opens and Mooney
gets out. Walks to the front door and KNOCKS. But this time, there’s no
answer. Mooney rings the bell. Still nothing. Suspicious, he checks
around the side…and sees the back door SWAYING in the wind.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Hello? L.A.P.D. Anybody home?</p>
<p><strong>the imposter jessica martin</strong>: Hiding in ambush at the
top of the stairs, gun in hand. She listens to Mooney’s footsteps and
when she thinks he’s neared the top – she springs out, blasting away
down the staircase! But Mooney’s not there.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Drop your gun, now. I got you.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: I said drop it.’</p>
<p><strong>140 int. shadowy corridor - continuous 140</strong>: A narrow
hallway with multiple OPEN DOORWAYS on each side. The Imposter Jessica
could be hiding in any one of them… Taking care not to give himself
away, Mooney inches down the hallway. And just when he’s thinking that
he may have successfully created an element of surprise for himself–</p>
<p><strong>sfx</strong>: SQUEEEEAK – the floorboards of the old house
groan softly – GIVING HIS POSITION AWAY! Instantly Bayback swings out
from a doorway right next to Mooney, taps her gun to his chest pulls the
tang– But Mooney DIVES OUT OF THE WAY! BLAMM-BLAMM-BLAMM!! Two miss, but
the third shot NAILS HIS SHOULDER! OOF! Mooney lands hard. Blood
spreading out under his white dress shirt. He cocks his head… listening
for the sound of- BAYBACK EJECTS A MAGAZINE and is about to reload–
Mooney JUMPS UP, RETURNS FIRE – slamming Bayback against the wall with
two .38 caliber slugs. She collapses to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Damn it! DAMN IT!!</p>
<p><strong>bayback</strong>: ..a-ambulance…</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Tell me where Jessica Martin is or you bleed
to death right here.</p>
<p><strong>bayback</strong>: ..p-please..call.. I.. I’m a–</p>
<p><strong>where is she?!</strong>: Bayback struggles for air, reaching
for him–</p>
<p><strong>bayback</strong>: …I’m a cop…</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Request emergency back up and medical units!
Officers down at-</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Ho - shit!</p>
<p><strong>142 ext. kidnappers’ safehouse - day 142</strong>: Jessica
SMASHES A REAR WINDOW with a long thick branch and uses it to try to pry
the bars apart. The limited leverage won’t enable her to bend them
enough for Ricky to squeeze through.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Faster Mom!</p>
<p><strong>sfx: gravel crunching in the driveway</strong>: Jessica leans
her head around the back corner of the guesthouse – and sees the
Escalade pulling in!</p>

Pulls into the driveway. Greer and his team are going over surveillance
photos taken from the cameras at the Fegan Securities Building. The</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: These are the best pictures you could get of
him?!</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: He was wearing a visor.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Useless!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Baby, listen to me. I want you to get away
from this window. I want you to go to the other side of the room as far
away from the door as you can –</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: No, don’t leave me! Don’t leave me!!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Honey, I’m getting you out of there!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Where are you going?!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’m only gonna be gone a second, and then
we’re gonna go home, but you have to do this first. It’s gonna be loud,
but don’t be scared, okay? Now go find somewhere safe like I told
you.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic #1</strong>: You’re lucky. Shot went clean through.
A few inches either way…</p>
<p><strong>detective tomlin</strong>: What the hell, Moon? It’s all over
the radio.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Jack, she didn’t identify herself.</p>
<p><strong>detective tomlin</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: I shot a cop! Dana Bayback. From the 23rd.
She was one of the kidnappers.</p>
<p><strong>detective tomlin</strong>: Let me call the tw9~three. See
what the hell’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: I hate to think more cops are involved,
but–</p>
<p><strong>detective tomlin</strong>: Did she say anything about the
Martin woman?</p>

side of an IMPOSING FENCE.</p>
<p><strong>simon cowell</strong>: Just give me my goddamned car!</p>
<p><strong>jaded cashier</strong>: Don’t take that tone of voice with
me, sir. I’ve already told you, we do not release vehicles until all

impounded! Can’t you understand that?! It was stolen from me!</p>
<p><strong>jaded cashier</strong>: Sir, do you want the car back or
not?</p>
<p><strong>simon cowell</strong>: Yes! But I’m not paying for it!</p>
<p><strong>jaded cashier</strong>: Nevermind, Howie. Take ’er back.</p>
<p><strong>simon cowell</strong>: Wait, wait! All right you bloody
fascist, I’ll pay. But if there’s even the slightest scratch on it…</p>

HISPANIC YOUTH out of the frame, legs disappear off-screen in short
bursts.</p>
<p><strong>pan diagonally to another angle:</strong>: And more
terrifying, GREER stops picking up shell casings, turning his head
ominously toward the CAMERA! Noticing us! Greer motions to several

<p><strong>167 ext. santa monica pier - sunset 167</strong>: Boats clog
the water, and th9usands of SPECTATORS line the shores of the Pacific,

Eve.</p>

fifty possible targets here!</p>
<p><strong>176 ext. santa monica pier 176</strong>: TOMLIN AND MOONEY
move along the crowd, scanning the sea of spectators for Ryan. Mooney
moves more slowly behind Tomlin, skin looking pale, sheened in sweat and
laboring for breath as they hike up the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Your turn. Now you show me something.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: No. Put them on the Ferris wheel. I want to
see them safe first.</p>

SKATE RATS scare the ELDERLY.</p>

over the DVD and then you and the funky bunch take us out.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: I swore I wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Like you swore to protect and serve?</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: You know a lot…</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: And I’ll forget a lot, too. But not until
they’re both out of danger.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Your choice, man. The Martins or the DVD.
Either way, I’m not hanging around any longer. You got five seconds,

<p><strong>181 ext. santa monica pier - night 181</strong>: A
sickly-looking MOONEY glances at the commotion – and sees the hoodless
Ryan.</p>

<p><strong>12 ext. santa monica pier - bluff - night 182</strong>: Ryan
desperately tries to shoo Chloe away.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It isn’t safe to talk, get it? I – People are
after me!</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: What – are you high?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: I’ve been..looking for..you, kid–</p>

<p><strong>railing.</strong>: Mooney SCREAMS out in pain and grabs his
shoulder, releasing– Ryan, who BREAKS AWAY and turns to see Mooney
COLLAPSE to the ground, holding his blood-soaked shoulder. Ryan looks
over to Chloe, whose face is a combination of shock and confusion.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Oh my God– Someone call 911!</p>
<p><strong>tomlin</strong>: It’s over kid.</p>
<p><strong>tomlin</strong>: For all the trouble you’ve caused, you’d
better have that goddamned disc. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Aw shit…</p>
<p><strong>tension…</strong>: He KICKS BACK hard into Tomlin’s SHIN. It
is enough for Tomlin to release his grip and Ryan bolts. Tomlin recovers
and raises his GUN to get a bead on Ryan, but it causes the crowd around
him to PANIC.</p>
<p><strong>crowd goer</strong>: Dude’s gotta gun!</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: Under the pier. Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>186 underwater pov 186</strong>: Ryan flails, panicking,
exhaling all his air and sucking in the dark water of the ocean –</p>
<p><strong>187 underwater 187</strong>: Ryan is struggling. Bleeding.
Sinking. Dying. His lungs convulse, trying to breathe, burning like a
thousand red-hot needles are pushing their way through his chest. The
WAVES POUND against the thick pylons below the pier. Just as Ryan comes
up for air he’s SLAMMED into a wooden pylon! Ryan fights for his life as
the surge churns him underwater, BASHING him repeatedly against the
pillars. It’s not pretty.</p>
<p><strong>188 ext. santa monica pier - night 188</strong>: TOMLIN races
down the pier towards the beach – GREEK aims his weapon at the ocean,
daring Ryan to surface.</p>
<p><strong>189 ext. under the santa monica pier - beach - night
189</strong>: Ryan finally makes it to shore; coughing, retching. He
crawls up the sand, out of breath, blood trailing behind him. He unzips
the waterproof pocket of his shorts, pulling out the cellphone, which
thank God is actually dry. Ryan forces himself into action; stumbling,
exhausted into a –</p>
<p><strong>190 int. storage dory - under the pier - night 190</strong>:
The place is dark. Empty. An array of rowing shells covered in ghostly,
flapping tarps make the place look vaguely haunted. This place is also
filled with storage equipment, such as buoys and safety netting used by
the beach patrol.</p>
<p><strong>191 ext. under the santa monica pier - beach - night
191</strong>: TOMLIN - racing through the sand under the pier. He spots
Ryan’s bloody footprints and follows them toward the –</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Think! Think!</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: You better lie still. The paramedics should
be here shortly.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Just keep that ambulance close by.</p>
<p><strong>194 int. the dory entrance - night 194</strong>: TOMLIN - By
the time his eyes adjust to the dark, Ryan is nowhere to be seen. TARPS
undulate over jumbles of boxes and equipment everywhere – a hundred
places to hide. Alone, Tomlin stalks among the equipment. Gun out.
Hunting Ryan like a snake on the scent or prey.</p>
<p><strong>tomlin</strong>: You’re wounded kid, just give me what I came
for, and I’ll let you all go.</p>
<p><strong>196 int. dory - continuous 196</strong>: Tomlin’s ready to
pounce.</p>
<p><strong>sfx</strong>: Nearby, Ryan’s cellphone starts to RING,
betraying him! Instantly, Tomlin hones in on the noise – coming from
under a bulky tarp along the far wall – and EMPTIES HIS GUN at it! The
tarp shreds. Nothing could survive the assault. Tomlin walks calmly
across the room to stand before the tarp.</p>
<p><strong>tomlin</strong>: Shoulda stayed at home this morning,
kid.</p>
<p><strong>^_ ryan</strong>: Funny. I was about to say the same to
you.</p>
<p><strong>tomlin</strong>: What the–</p>

no luck on the walkie.</p>
<p><strong>hodges</strong>: Tomlin? Anyone copy?</p>
<p><strong>198 ext. santa monica beach - night 198</strong>: RYAN -
losing blood, he does his best to move quickly through the sand. He
stumbles, but regains his footing as he makes his way towards the STAIRS
LEADING UP TO THE PIER.</p>
<p><strong>199 ext. carousel roof - night 199</strong>: ELLIS - still on
the roof, scans the pier.</p>

listening intently to the walkie.</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: I’ve got a clean shot.</p>

�v,</p>
<p><strong>203 int. kidnappers’ van - night 203</strong>: JESSICA -

the van, but not before grabbing the WALKIE TALKIE and GUN.</p>
<p><strong>204 ext. parking lot - night 204</strong>: RYAN - sneaking
his way through parked cars, heads in the direction of the Police
Cruisers on the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>205 ext. carousel - night 205</strong>: MOONEY - scanning the
pier for Ryan, hears-</p>
<p><strong>ellis</strong>: He’s heading for the cops. We should do it
now.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: ““Freeze! Drop your weapon!</p>
<p><strong>206 ext. parking lot - night 206</strong>: RYAN - stopping in
his tracks, looks in the direction of the gun shot. He turns around only
to find – A PISTOL pointed right at his face – Greer’s pistol. He PUSHES
Ryan behind a SUV so as not to be seen by the cops.</p>
<p><strong>greek</strong>: No more bullshit! Just give me the goddamn
disc!</p>
<p><strong>dvd.</strong>: Greer snatches it and SMASHES it to pieces.
Fragments fall through the cracks in the pier, to the ocean below. Ryan,
pale as ghost, knows he’s seconds from meeting his maker.</p>
<p><strong>greer</strong>: This is about to be the most enjoyable part
of an extremely shitty day.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Tell me why I shouldn’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Jess… Jessica? Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I… I have to.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Lower the weapon, Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Ricky’s safe. It’s all going to be okay. Put
it down.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Thank you for keeping your promise.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Hey man, your shitty day is about to get a
whole lot shittier.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: Ain’t that a bitch?</p>

TELEVISION SCREEN showing an aerial shot of the Santa Monica Pier. PULL
OUT to reveal- CHLOE AND RYAN, sitting in a hospital dayroom, engrossed
in the NEWS REPORT that plays in the far corner of the room. Ryan’s
shoulder has now been BANDAGED, his arm’s in a sling.</p>
<p><strong>news anchor</strong>: …The Santa Monica Pier was the latest
setting in the ongoing 23rd Precinct corruption scandal. Ryan Ackerman,
a local resident, risked his life to save a family kidnapped by officers

<p><strong>chloe</strong>: “““How does it feel to be a hero?</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: It hurts… But you’re making it way better. I’m
just glad it’s over.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Modesty can be sexy.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: And to think this was our first date.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Next time, skip the shower.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Craig’s very weak, but the doctors say it
looks promising. He’s probably going to have to walk with a cane, but
that’s the worst of it… I’m just thankful.</p>
<p><strong>chloe</strong>: Come on Ricky, let’s get a hot chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I can’t believe I almost lost everything
that means… I don’t know how I can ever thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ryan</strong>: I do. Don’t ever call me again.</p>
<p><strong>ecu of security footage of the parking lot murder</strong>: A
CELL PHONE RINGS on a nearby table. They turn to look at it, neither one
