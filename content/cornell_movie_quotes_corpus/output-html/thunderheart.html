<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey. Nice tie.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t get too attached.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Ya got the paper?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re my hero, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Heroes ain’t supposed to shake. I’m shakin’,
man, look at me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Breathe, Carl. Four, nice, deep ones.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Anyone stops us going in, we’re with the
Bowen-Hamilton Textile Company. We have rug samples.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Rug samples.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We are one-dimensional, boring peddlers of fine
carpet, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>black man</strong>: Hey, look who’s here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Louis, my man, what’s happenin’?</p>
<p><strong>fence man</strong>: Clean ones?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Immaculate.</p>
<p><strong>fence man</strong>: What ya got there, seventy-five
thousand?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: A hundred and ten. Count it.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Have the girl count it, we can’t sit around
here countin’ bonds, we got things to do here.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: F.B.I.! Get your face on the fuckin’ floor!
MOVE!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Slam dunk.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Beauty. Beauty…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Jesus Christ, Larry, what the fu– Larry.
That’s not even your name, is it? What’s your real name, you fucking
scumbag?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Don’t have one, Carl. I have a number, man.
Just like the numbers on those treasury checks. You stole from your own
country, Carl. Shame on you.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Sugar Ray.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: They want ya Home. Upstairs wants to see
ya.</p>
<p><strong>louis</strong>: Make sure ya spell my name right.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: We just spent four months together… I thought
he was my friend… what the fuck, man? He had dinner at my mother’s.</p>
<p><strong>intercom</strong>: SA Levoi, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Ray…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mister Tully.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Do you want a coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No. No, no. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Levoi, Cooch. Raymond Levoi, Criminal
Division.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Oh, yeah – right.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Ray this is –</p>
<p><strong>ray / tully</strong>: Frank Couture.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>couture</strong>: Hello, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s an honor.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Ray, we’re taking you off the street. We need
you out in South Dakota.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: South Dakota… Did I do something
unsatisfactory, Sir?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: No, Ray. You’re gonna have to blame that on
your grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Interesting bloodline you have, Ray. French,
Scots-Irish, Italian, …and one-eighth American Indian.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Sioux Indian, right?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not that sure. Yeah, I think –</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: – yes, Teton Sioux. Father’s side.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: Ray, there’s been a homicide out in an area
known as The Badlands. Indian Reservation.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: It’s not the first. There’s been several. And
our field office in Rapid City is getting a lot of heat… none of the
investigations have turned up jack shit.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: The main problem is, Ray, these people are
extremely distrustful of outsiders, non-Indians. Relations have not been
amicable.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Different culture. Hard to penetrate. The
Indians don’t like white cops poking around. And that’s why we’re in a
position where we have to bring in an American Indian agent.</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: With an Indian representative out there, we
hope to keep hostilities dormant; this is a COINTELPRO, Selective
Operations Unit, and it’ll be easier on Agent Couture if you can gain
the people’s trust and maybe –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Woh, excuse me, Sir… I see what you’re saying…
I’ve got a little Indian blood, that’s true. But – I am not an… an
Indian. I can’t just go in and –</p>
<p><strong>tully</strong>: – your father was part Sioux.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I didn’t know him, Sir. He passed away when I
was six.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Seven.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Don’t worry about it, Ray. As long as the
people have proof that we sent them one of their own, no one’s gonna ask
you to weave baskets or make it rain.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Eight murders in less than a year. All of them
Indian. All of them unsolved. Is the law a non-entity out here or
what?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Those are two agents who went into a
reservation a few years ago to serve a warrant. They were executed at
close range. That one there is a police officer killed by the Mohawks up
in Canada more recently.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: The agents who have worked out here say its
like going into Nam. Unfamiliar terrain, foreign language, foreign
customs… and you never know when you might walk into a few rounds. They
hold a lot of old anger for the white man out here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Were you in Nam?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Airborne. That’s where they used to get us
agents from. Now we get ’em from Carnegie-Melon, Ivy League. Accountants
and computer whiz-kids. Yuppies with guns. That’s scary shit.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Not as scary as a Hoover man with a
computer.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Hey, hey, hey. J. Edgar would’ve loved you.
He’d love anybody who joined the bureau to, what was it? “To enforce the
laws of my country and protect her interests”?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You crashed my file?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: No. I consulted it. We’re going into Indian
Country, I wanna know what kind of individual is covering my ass. Don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’ve been in the bureau for thirty years. You
survived The Hoov, the Black Panthers and Abscam. I don’t see any bullet
holes. That’s good enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Who found him?</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Indian kids. Hunting fossils.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Okay. I think Agent Levoi and I can proceed
from here. What are your call signals?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: PX-10 and 11. Anything we can do to help
you out, just radio.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Good. Thanks, Guys.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Leo Fast Elk… Thirty seven… single… Member of
the Tribal Council.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Looks like Fast Elk wasn’t fast enough to
outrun that load. What do you make of the damage?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Six rounds. 357.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: That’s what it looks like, doesn’t it? But
that’s what a ten gauge, choke-bored, shotgun will look like when it
hits your lower back from five feet away.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Somebody was serious about doing this guy,
that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Ray.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Taking ol’ Leo somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Leo’s been out here too long, man. I’m
taking him to ceremonial burial.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: This is a restricted area.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Check him out, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Nice piece. You come back here to cover your
tracks, Geronimo? What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: It ain’t Geronimo.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: I think maybe you guys got off the wrong
exit, yeah? This is the Bear Creek Indian Reservation.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: I know where I am. I’m on federal land, doing
a federal investigation, and if you don’t wanna cooperate you can take a
ride in a federal car, and spend the rest of the day in a little room,
answering federal questions. It’s your call. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: I’m a full blood Oglala Sioux, born and
raised on this reservation.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: You’re a wise-ass. Ray check his wallet.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Who the fuck is he?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: – a fucking cop.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Walter Crow Horse. Tribal Police.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: He’s a fucking cop.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: We got the wire ya was comin’. You’re
the Indian official, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: No. No, that’s Ray, here. Ray, uh… Ray…
Little Weasel.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Leo’s gotta get to burial, Brother. He’s
gotta make the journey.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: What journey?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Tell him, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Leo has to take the journey, Cooch.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: We’ll have to give Leo a refund. Because he’s
gotta go to the M.E. In case you don’t know, Officer, violation of the
Major Crimes Act on –</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: – an Indian Reservation is within the
jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau of Intimidation. I know that.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Good. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: I said when can Leo be taken to
ceremony?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: After we’ve completed our investigation.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: That’s a nice suit.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Somebody must be doing something somewhere in
your jurisdiction, Officer Crow Foot.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You ain’t gonna cut his hands off and
send ’em to Washinton, are ya? They done that to one of our girls once.
Leo did quillwork, he’s gonna need his hands.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Leo’s gonna need his hands, Cooch. He does
quillwork.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: I think Leo’s retired from quillwork for the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Respect the dead, Hoss. Because when
–</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: – did you understand me when I said that
–</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: – violation of the Major Crimes Act on
an Indian Reservation is within the jurisdiction of the Federal Bureau
of Instigation. I know that.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: What the hell you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: His mother needs a piece of his hair.
It’s for the Keeping of the Souls Ceremony. Has to be kept for four
days.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Keeping of the souls. Do they still burn
their dead or something?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Beats the hell outta me.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Sorry, Ray. You’re gonna have to wait in the
car. I’ll bring you out a cheeseburger.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: You made it. Was-te.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: You must be… President Clear Bone.</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: Clear Moon. Moon. You must be the
Sioux.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: No. That’s Ray here. Ray…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Ray Levoi, Sir. Pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: It’s about time they sent us one of our
own. Was-te.</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: Things are no good here. It is like war
zone. We need an official who understands what is good for the Indian
people. Who knows Indian way.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I thought we were staying on the
reservation.</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: Yes. Rooms thirteen and fourteen are on
Indian land.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: Are you hungry? I have some nice raw
kidney in the truck.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh, I’m set, Sir. I’m set.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: He’s starving, Mr. Clear Moon. Get him some
raw kidney. He hasn’t had any Indian food in days…</p>
<p><strong>white local</strong>: Where you goin’? Back to the res?</p>
<p><strong>white local</strong>: What ya doin’? You drunk?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Let’s take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: What’s goin’ on here? I can’t walk across the
goddamn street without some breed-ass fallin’ all over me?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Watch out now, he wants a kiss, Ray, wants a
kiss –</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Go ahead, skin, get your ass back on your
sacred land. Get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Get outta here. Drive.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: So what type of salesmen are you gentlemen
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Liquor. We heard they like their drink on the
reservation, and we were gonna see if we couldn’t unload some surplus on
the way to Nebraska.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Now keep that between us, Dennis, cuz I don’t
know what kinda Johnny Law they got here.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Hey, Brooks, come over here. I want you to
meet a coupla fellas from Denver.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Liquor salesmen. Be nice to them, maybe
they’ll give you a sample of some of that gin you like. He likes that
Russian shit that –</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: They ain’t liquor salesmen. They’re</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Brooks, what’s a perceptive fellow like you,
doing in a joint like this? Let me buy you a glass of some of that
Russian shit you like.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: FBI? What you investigatin’?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: A murder. On the reservation.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Again. Figures, man.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: You’ll never find out who did it.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: You underestimate me, Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: No. You underestimate these grass niggers.
They’re killing each other. That’s all they do. Get drunk and kill each
other. Then cover for each other. Who gives a damn really as long as
they stay on their reservation. You ask me, the government shouldn’t
care one particle.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You know how in your big cities, you got
your niggers and you got your Puerto Ricans? Well out here we got
Indians. That’s just the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: The only good Indian is a dead Indian, does
that old adage still hold true out here?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: That set-to you saw out front, was nothin’
more than a message we were sendin’ to the sonsabitches that are
divertin’ water from the river.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: We got rights. We got a ranch just up
here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Did any of you gentlemen know Leo Fast Elk?</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: You fellas are here to investigate a Indian
crime, you should keep to Indian land, and talk to them, not us. But you
wanna drink here and shoot stick here, that’s your right, and we respect
that. Come on, Son, we’re up on the table.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: You fellas wanna play doubles?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Water. Worth killing for out here, I’d
think.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Get the plate numbers off everyone of these
cars.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I already did.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>recorder</strong>: – out here we got our Indians. And that’s
the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: By the time you get to the main village,
sun’ll be up. I want you to fraternize. Socialize. Penetrate.
Infiltrate. Eat some raw kidney, and get these Indians talking. I’m
gonna Powwow with Big Chief Clear Moon and find out more about Leo.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks- Dreamer.
Hello, I’m looking for Hobert Standing- Buffalo-That-Walks… Dreamer.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Good morning. I’m looking for Hobert-
Buffalo-Dreaming… Hobert Standing-Buffalo-That-Walks–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: –Dreamer.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Ray Little Weasel. FBI. I like the way
ya sneaked up on me. Must be Indian.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What are you –</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You’re steppin’ on sign.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey. Hey, you, listen up –</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: – Leo wasn’t killed here. He was dumped
here. Out of a vehicle. Bald tread. Muffler held on with baling
wire.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: The man you want… stepped outta the car,
dragged Leo out, laid him down. Then walked over here and made a circle
in the earth with a stick. I can’t find the stick. He stuck an eagle
plume in the circle, got back in his car, dustin’ his own prints with a
pine bough for about six feet, but he missed a print, right here, see.
He got in his car and went Hell- bent-for-Holy-Sunday outta here. He
ditched that pine bough three miles across the flat, in the Little Bear
River, it floated down to Thundershield Gap. The car hit paved road, and
was outta here.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: The killin’ was done where Leo’s mother
lives. But he was driven here into these Badlands.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Big sonuvabuck. Based on the depth of
that print, pressure releases… I’d say he goes two-ten, two-fifteen
–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: – Well, maybe two-seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re trying to tell me you can read all that
from a track?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: No. Not just a track. You gotta listen
to the trees, man. To the leaves. To this sand, you FBI’s kicked all up.
You gotta listen to the earth.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is that right? Well, listen to this: drag your
ass. This is a restricted area.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: No, this is the home of the Oglala Sioux
and I want the dog-fucker who killed Leo. Whether you get him or I get
him, I just want him. Shit’s been goin’ on too long.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’ve got no jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You got no know-how. About Indian Way.
Or about Jack Shit for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Maybe you’re not aware of this, Crow Horse, but
I just flew in from a place called the Twentieth Century where we have
such things as electrostatic tracking methods, psycholingusitics, DNA
fingerprinting; I don’t have to crawl around with the scorpions and talk
to the fucking trees to get answers. Leo was killed right here.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Go back to the M.E., take a look inside
Leo’s exit wounds and tell me how chicken feed got in there. Trust me,
there ain’t chickens in the Badlands. His mother’s place is –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: – his mother never lived here. She was from up
in North Dakota.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: I’m talkin’ his spiritual mother. Maisy
Blue Legs.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: His spiritual mother…</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: To us Indians, our spiritual relatives
are as close as family. I’ve got seven mothers on this reservation.
Sisters. Brothers. You ain’t one of them.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Thank God. Now listen to me, asshole. I’m
giving you a break. But if my partner finds out you’re here, you’re
gonna be reading rat tracks in Sioux Falls Maximum Security.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Easy. Easy… I’m goin’.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Hey, Little Weasel.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You weigh one sixty-three, yeah? Not a
beer drinker. You’re one of these tofu and pilaf characters. Pack your
gun, under your coat – left shoulder. But you got backup; a little .32,
.38 maybe, in a ankle holster that gives you a right foot drag, Shoes
are too tight at the toe but, man, they look cool. And that’s what
counts.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Crow Horse.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mrs… Blue Legs? Can I ask you a few questions
–</p>
<p><strong>maisy</strong>: – go away. Leave us alone…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Ma’am, Please –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mrs. Blue Legs. I’m Indian.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m Sioux.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Shit. Mrs. Blue Legs! It’s okay!</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: X21, give me a 20.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Black Tail District, X22. You ready for this?
Leo wasn’t killed in the Badlands. I… I found the location.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Maisy Blue Legs place?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How’d you know?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: I got one up on ya.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: I’ve got the doer. I know who he is.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Meet me at base. Over.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Cooch. You’re my hero.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Jimmy Looks Twice.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: One of the leaders of the Warriors of All Red
Nations. Militant organization.</p>
<p><strong>close on - file photo</strong>: a raging fire and six
long-haired, fist-raising Indians, yelling at the camera.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: The progressive Indians don’t like them
because they want everybody to go back to the old Indian ways, and the
old way Indians don’t like them because they use violence to get
attention.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: White eagle feather through the circle. That’s
their symbol.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: They obviously wanted it to be known that they
offed Leo. Some kind of statement.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Jimmy Looks Twice put Leo’s head through a
glass door of the tribal offices three months ago. And threatened him
several times since. President Clear Moon and the regional FBI feel he
made good on that threat.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’d just like five minutes alone with the
motherfucker who hung that flag upside down.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Easy, Cowboy. No vendettas on my ship. Now:
remember what I told you about Nam? Watch the grass, watch the trees,
watch the shit house, be on your toes, and if we get committed, don’t
hesitate to empty that sucker.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Alright. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: It’s show time.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: On the ground.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mitakue Oyasin!</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: This is the FBI! Come on out of there nice
and slow. Let’s move it! Hands on your head!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hands on your head, Sir. Come on, come on…</p>
<p><strong>looks twice</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: James Looks Twice?</p>
<p><strong>looks twice</strong>: That’s right. What are you doing here?
This is a religious ceremony you’re desecrating.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’re FBI, James. We just need to ask you a few
questions.</p>
<p><strong>looks twice</strong>: We are in the middle of a sweat lodge
ceremony. Do you drag people out of your churches when they’re in the
middle of prayer?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Let’s take a walk, Jimmy. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Go ahead. You can all go home.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: We just wanna take a look around your place,
Jimmy. We’re not here to bust your balls.</p>
<p><strong>looks twice</strong>: What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Your good friend Leo Fast Elk.</p>
<p><strong>looks twice</strong>: You think I killed him? Cuz he was an
apple? Well, let me tell you something about Leo, Man –</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: – don’t “man” me, Jimmy. Where’s the key?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Ray, use the federal master key.</p>
<p><strong>looks twice</strong>: No. Don’t do that. Don’t deface the
property, man. The key’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>looks twice</strong>: Inside… in the coffee can.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: There’s no coffee can in –</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Jesus… Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Get him…</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Assault on federal officers. Suspect has left
the area. One officer down. Issue a Fugitive Alert immediately.
Over.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Has the officer been shot, X-22?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: No, the officer’s been bitten by a fucking
badger, okay? Get a Fugitive Alert fucking now! Over.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You’re an easy man to track, Ray. Ya
walk like a penguin with a hard-on.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is that right? What are the trees saying
today?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: They’re sayin’ that nobody’s gonna talk
to you cuz they don’t give away one of their own. But they did say
there’s somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk
to you.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He sent me to find ya. He says he’s got
information.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty
medicine.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Medicine. As in medicine man?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Why does he wanna see me?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Good question. Hardly sees anybody
anymore. Hasn’t left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some
tobacco?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: When you go see an elder, you always
bring some tobacco as a gift.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He wants to know if you ever watch the
Cookie Monster. He says the Cookie Monster is not to be trusted – a
trickster.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He says there’s something wrong with Big
Bird – he’s crazy, He says you stopped the Inipi ceremony last
night…?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: But he is not unhappy with you because
he knows you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He knows me?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He says he saw you in a vision some time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: I guess he had this vision some time
ago, in the Moon of the Popping Trees – uh, back in the winter. He says
you come from Wasi’cu city in the East but that your people… way back…
are of the Minniconjou Sioux. But you yourself don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He says he knew you’d be coming to Bear
Creek. He was told. It is the will of Tunkasilia – the grandfather that
you come here. He says let’s smoke the caanunpa the sacred pipe, symbol
of truth. So that there will be no lies between us.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s he smoke in that?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Sacred herbs. Tobacco. Don’t worry, we
don’t smoke no Mexican agriculture in The Pipe. That’s a white man’s
myth. This is a sacrament.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: Mltaku Oyasin.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You don’t smoke with him, it means
you’re hiding something.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He says Wakan. Sacred. Five hundred year
old turtleshell rattle, passed down from the Grandfathers. Heavy
duty.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He says, it is good. The Spirits are
here. The Spirits want to know what you’re doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Tell him I’m trying to find the man who
murdered Leo Fast Elk. Ask him if he knows where he is.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He said he doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He just did the Gettysburg Address in Sioux.
What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Uh… Grandpa likes to trade; no one stops
by here without gettin’ stuck in the old Indian barter. He, uh… he likes
your shades.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What was he saying?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Why should I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Because he was talking to me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Does he know something?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: The old man saw an owl. Over there in
the dry wash. Last week.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: And…</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He saw an owl.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: The owl is a messenger. When one shows
itself to a Sioux… it means someone’s gonna die. The owl told him about
Leo.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The owl told him about Leo. That’s incredible.
I guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn’t we?
Evidence doesn’t get any harder than that – not for my money. Is there
anyway we can seduce this owl into Federal Court?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He also said “listen to the water.”</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also
said, don’t trust the fucking Cookie Monster.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Go back to your DNA finger-printin’.</p>
<p><strong>over this, a screaming. a high-pitched, chilling,
scream</strong>: that takes us straight into –</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Was-te Yelo! Let’s have five more veterans.
Five more veterans. Hoka Hey!</p>
<p><strong>chasing hawk</strong>: What is that that you honor there,
uncles? After all the Wasi’cu country has done to you, after all he
still does to you, you honor that flag?! That flag has been desecrated
by the United States, because they have not honored what that flag
represents!</p>
<p><strong>chasing hawk</strong>: To them, we are the Bank of America.
Whenever they get into a little difficulty, they go to The Bank,
withdraw a little land, withdraw a little oil –</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: Okay. Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Who’s this guy?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Anderson Chasing Hawk. Second in command
behind Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Magedelana Eagle Bear. Eagle’s claws and a
bear’s balls.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: She keeps an AR-15 assault rifle in her
truck. And she’ll use it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mr. Clear Moon.</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: Our police are afraid of them. Please
get them out of here.</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: They’re going to kill me next. That’s
what I hear. These new Indians are destroying everything. Our people are
a quiet people.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: They can lead us to Jimmy. Just let them go.
We’re tightening the net on him. We know he’s on the reservation.</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: Help us.</p>
<p><strong>agent sherman</strong>: Where’s Jimmy? We thought he’d be
dancing today.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: Are you the Washington Redskin?</p>
<p><strong>agent miles</strong>: Say hello to Richard Yellow Bird,
Ray.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Ray, get to Jimmy’s place and keep it tight.
I’m gonna get a tail on his Warriors.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: down below the van, a small, patchy RES DOG
with a missing leg is looking up at him with his tongue long and
salivating.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: the truck parks. Someone jumps out, gracefully.
Indian. Long braid. Quick steps. Front door. Inside.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: X22. Read.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Go ahead, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I have a pick-up truck. No plates. Subject –
Indian – entering suspect’s house. Over.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Okay, Ray. I’m coming in. If he starts to
leave the area, move in. And hold him. Over.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: FBI, freeze, Motherfucker – drop it, drop
it!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Turn around, put your hands on the roof of the
truck.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re the Indian FBI.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s right. Turn around.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: The people are glad they sent you. They
usually send in guys who come at ya with highbeams, screamin’ “drop it,
Motherfucker”, stick a gun in your face, frisk ya down. Even if ya got a
child with ya. No, it’s good to have ya. It’s gonna be was-te times on
the res.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I was gonna warn ya about messin’ with
somebody’s medicine bundle but I forgot you know all about that
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: This Jimmy’s?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re not gonna catch him. He can
shape-shift into different animals. Bear. Elk. Porcupine.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is that like an hereditary thing, Magdelana, or
can one take classes?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Jimmy didn’t kill Leo. Why do you wanna do
this?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He tried to kill him twice before. That’s a
good place to start don’t ya think? Leo was on the other side, wasn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: – Leo was an apple, that’s right. Red on the
outside, white on the inside. And Jimmy hated him. Kicked his ass a
coupla times. But he didn’t kill him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Who did?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You’re the FBI. That’s your job, isn’t it?
Ya know how many of our Warrior brothers got killed out here? I never
saw any investigating then. Why now? What’s going down here?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: A Fugitive Alert for a murder suspect. Before
somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Try the Fort Laramie Treaty. All over
again.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Look. You and I can stand here in a culture
clash til the sun comes up, talking about what’s right and what’s wrong.
You’re from the reservation. It’s a different world.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: I’m from Minneapolis. Fifth Street. I did
four years at Dartmouth before I ever set foot on this res. So I know
about the other world, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Are you gonna keep that medicine bundle or
are you gonna respect its power?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: When you see Jimmy, tell him the sooner he
turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in… the sooner
we back off this reservation. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Grandpa Reaches says you come from heavy
Indian blood. I used to think Grandpa was gettin’ senile. Now I know he
is.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Move it, Magdelana.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Ray, you alright?</p>
<p><strong>agent sherman</strong>: What do we got, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It was just Eagle Bear. I questioned and
released her.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: What’d she say?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: She talks a lot of shit. We’re not doing our
job. Jimmy’s innocent. “What’s the FBI really doing here.” Some shit
about the Fort Laramie Treaty.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: She took something from the house. What she
called a medicine bundle. Most likely Jimmy’s.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Let’s see it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I gave it back to her.</p>
<p><strong>agent sherman</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: If it is Jimmy’s, she’s taking it to him. We’ll
have a runner. But I borrowed a little mojo…</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Way to go, Raymond. Miles, take that to lab.
Sherman, I want you to go back to base and produce some written
material. Something that indicates that our girl Maggie is leaking
information to us. And make sure that material finds its way into the
hands of the Warrior Movement.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: You gentlemen missed that medicine basket. Go
back through the house, and make sure you missed nothing else. And lay
some wire, too. Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: That’s good goddamn work, Ray. Let the salmon
run. Let ’em run Upriver.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Why we setting Eagle Bear up as an
informant?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Her own people start to suspect her, it
creates discord from within. The Warriors don’t know who to trust, they
start infighting, and Jimmy loses his support.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Her oil pan is shot.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Cooch. What’s the Fort Laramie Treaty?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Jesus, I don’t know. You tell me. You’re the
Indian.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Get a tail on her, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Cooch. Where the fuck did they send us?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: A long way from home. You be careful out
there.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: For all I know, you’re Jimmy. And you’re just
waiting for a shot at my jugular. Drink, Jimmy. Milk is good for you
–</p>
<p><strong>in the side mirror</strong>: Crow Horse, racing up on the
left of the van. Ray pulls his hat down low, and sits back. The
motorcycle passes on the left, slowing enough so that Crow Horse can
flip Ray the middle finger. Then he races on, far down the road.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Don’t be mad. That was just an old
traditional gesture that means hello, how are you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I see. Forgive my cultural ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Jimmy didn’t do it, Ray. I checked it
out. You can stop taggin’ my sister.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: She’s your sister?</p>
<p><strong>ray and crow horse</strong>: Spiritual sister.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Gotchya. We just nailed a genetic match between
the eagle feather left at the murder site and one in Jimmy’s medicine
bundle. It came from a white eagle. Same bird.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: So did this one. Wambli is a rare and
sacred creature. When someone finds a dead one, the feathers get around
the res. We share everything. A lot of power in the eagle feathers. But
you think that’s bullshit too, don’t –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: – Leo Fast Elk was sitting in the outhouse at
Maisy Blue Legs when a car pulled into the yard. He came out, approached
the vehicle then saw that the man behind the wheel was Jimmy. He tried
to get back into the trailer, but the car came highballing at him. He
started running for the open grass. With the car moving, Jimmy hung his
shotgun out the window, took aim – missed once, hitting the shitter –
fired again, and severed Leo’s spine. Leo fell, rolled, and came to a
stop in the grass. And some chicken feed. Stale chicken feed with four
days mold. Electromagnetic printing.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Was-te. ’Cept for one thing. Jimmy Looks
Twice was nowhere near there. Ya see, when Jimmy was twelve years old,
his mother and father was killed in a car wreck right down there near
Elk Mountain.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t see the connection.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: The connection is, it did a head number
on him. He’s petrified of cars. Won’t drive. I’ve known him all my life,
and he’s never gotten behind the wheel of a vehicle. He rides passenger
and he rides horses, and that’s it. The man that shot Leo down was
behind the wheel of a moving car.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s not solid.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You want solid? That one, single, print
he left in the Badlands – the one the FBI missed and then stepped all
over – it belongs to a man who walks heels first. Like a white man.
Jimmy has a serious Ind’n walk – ball of the foot first. The man who
murdered Leo walked like a Wasi’cu.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re saying a white guy did it…</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: When Leo was dumped out there in the
Badlands, he was dropped on his back. Our man made an effort to turn him
over, onto his face. It’s an old Ind’n belief that if a dead man is
turned face down, his spirit won’t leave. And in the killer’s case, it
won’t come back and jump all over his shit. That’s an Ind’n thing a
white man wouldn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: And that’s the way it is. Write it
down.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You laugh all you want, Breed. Sunset
tonight, I get my man.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Alright, Crow Horse. I’m listening. I’m
listening to the trees, to the stones. Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Damned if I know.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: But the Old One. He did a Yuwipi
ceremony last night.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The old man? He’s gonna tell you who killed
Leo?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Go catch Jimmy, Ray. Really. He’s
gettin’ away. Go ahead, go get him. I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey. Hey, those are my sunglasses you’re
wearing.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Grandpa traded with me. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He says, back behind Red Deer Table,
where the Elk-People-used-to-live… there are strange creatures from
another world who eat stones… and who will kill anyone who crosses into
this place.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He says, in the Yuwipi ceremony last
night, he saw you… going back into the land beyond Red Deer Table. I was
with you. But that was all the Spirits let him see so he doesn’t know if
you were killed or not. But he thinks you probably were.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Go to the land where the Elk-People-
used-to-live and you will find the answers you came here looking for.
But you must go as two. That is the vision. I have spoken. And this is
so.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He wants to trade. He likes your
watch.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I can’t do that, It’s a Rolex.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m sorry, this is – – this is very, very
expensive. It’s – Tell him this is an expensive watch.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He says, you need to go on Indian time.
He says your watch is ruining your life anyway.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Red Deer Table, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Don’t tell me: heavy duty.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Heavy, heavy duty. Taku Wakan. Wanagi
Spirits. It’s one of those few places we’d never go to as kids. Still
don’t. Some of the old people say Crazy Horse is buried back there. We
have to go Ray. Together. Like his vision.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Walter. When I fill out my 302, do I say that
evil spirits are killing everybody on the reservation?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Ray –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: – no. No offense to the old man. I appreciate
you trying to help. But I put my ass on the line coming out here,
man.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: What’d you expect to hear?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Not Native American myths and legends. I’m with
the FBI, Walter, remember? Not National Geographic.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: What you call myths, we call our
history.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s not real.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: What’s real to you? Wall Street? Capital
Hill? Now they are myths.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I can’t be dicking around here. That’s all I’m
saying. I don’t carry crystals, I don’t wanna come back in another life.
I just wanna do my job, and do it right, and get the fuck outta
here.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You ain’t no Indian. You’re a Sal Mineo
Indian.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: Knock it off!</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: Will ya knock it off? You’re actin’ like a
couple of old women.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: For cryin’ out loud. Knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He speaks English.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Only when he’s really pissed off.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: Come inside. Watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Don’t accuse nothin’ of not bein’ real,
Little Weasel. Cuz the only thing around here that ain’t real is
you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Take care of yourself, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p><strong>sa sherman</strong>: We’ve gotten word that Jimmy has been
trying to hook up with Maggie Eagle Bear… but some of the Warriors have
been sending word to Jimmy that she may be an FBI operative. So he
doesn’t know where to go.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Bingo. It’s working.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: He’s out of room. All the reservation exits
have been watchdogged. We got him. I give it twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Well we better use those twelve hours to
apprehend the right man.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: The right man? Talk to me, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Whoever dusted Leo, dusted him from the
driver’s seat of a moving car then drove those eight miles to the
Badlands. Jimmy Looks Twice has never been behind the wheel of a car.
It’s a known fact out here that he’s petrified of driving. His parents
were killed in a car wreck.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: That’s not very solid.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: There was also a print found in the Badlands
that indicated diagetic locomotion. Heels first. Jimmy’s walking pattern
doesn’t match. He has a distinct Indian walk.</p>
<p><strong>sa miles</strong>: Indian walk? You been smoking hooch in the
peace pipe, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: They don’t smoke hooch in The Pipe, Miles. They
smoke something called kinickinick, it’s like a tobacco.</p>
<p><strong>sa sherman</strong>: Well, you’re right about X21 being a
Washington Redskin, that’s for sure. What else, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: You boys want a soda?</p>
<p><strong>sa miles</strong>: Oh, yeah, a Coke. You buying?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: No, Ray’s buying. Sherman? Coke?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Oh… no. No, Cooch, I’m working on a coffee
here. Indian walk?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Genetic ditto on evidence found at the site
with evidence you found in his belongings. An incontrovertible motive.
And definite footprints on Jimmy Looks Twice at Maisy Blue Legs
house.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: When did we get that?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Today. And now you – there’s a dog in the van
–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: – I know. I fed it, and I can’t get rid of
–</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: You weren’t sent here to go off on your own
detail, Ray. You were sent here to assist in a Selective Operations
Unit. These regional agents are inept – that’s why they were sent out
here to The Graveyard, to Indian Country. I need you behind me, Ray. Not
pulling against me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not trying to pull against you, Cooch. I’ve
just been having nightmares about the way Leo was killed.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Your first homicide, that’s gonna happen,
Ray…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I just wanna make sure no one else gets done in
that way because we were in bed with the wrong doer.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Ray. I never get into bed with somebody
unless I know for sure. Just the way I was raised.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Alright. Alright…</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Yeah, alright, alright – fuck you – give a
yuppie a badge and he wants to take over the world. Go get a tail on
Eagle Bear, and stay with her. Cuz Jimmy’s gonna show. And I want you to
make the collar.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Ray.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: I’ll sleep around a little.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Thanks, Cooch.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: And get rid of the dog.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: stars. Millions of stars. And an incredible
full moon. It hangs huge over distant fields, a perfect sphere. The top
half of the moon is yellow, the bottom half a lava red.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Bastards…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: All I could think of was… not here. I don’t
wanna eat it on an Indian Reservation, three thousand miles from
home.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: He’s out there. He’s out there playing
Sitting Bull with us. I want the motherfucker so bad I’m getting a
bleeding ulcer.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It may have been Maggie’s way of saying “get
off my ass.”</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: She’s that subtle?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Eagle’s claws and a bear’s balls that’s what
her profile says.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Well, she’s running now, too. These fucking
people like to run, don’t –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: – Cooch. Woh. Stop.</p>
<p><strong>ray’s pov</strong>: Four-hundred feet across a flat area of
sandstone and grass clusters, something shimmers in the undulations of
the harsh morning sun. Something of pea green and rusty metal… glass
catches sunlight and makes prisms. A car. An old res car, sitting in a
long, chasm in barely a foot of green water.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Tread matches. It’s the car.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: But this doesn’t make any sense, Ray. If it’s
just been sitting in this dry wash for seven days… why the hell didn’t
we find it?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Because this isn’t a dry wash.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s the Little Walking River.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: And it was full of water when I drove by here
three days ago. Full. I mean… a river.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: The Little Walking River. You’re right. This
is part of it. So whoever sunk this car didn’t compensate for drought.
Goddamn.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Listen to the water…</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Agent Little Weasel, Federal Bura of
your Imagination.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Jesus Christ. You’re hammered. What are you
doing?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You’re right about the old man. His
power’s long dried up. He’s supposed to be a medicine man but he won’t
go see the people. He says we changed, and we don’t listen. Well, he
don’t go out and talk no more. I haven’t had a drink in three years but
I just turned my sobriety chip into that man behind the bar, and this
Hoss is gettin’ watered.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Cut the shit. You shouldn’t be in here,
Man.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Cuz I’m a skin?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Cuz you’re a cop.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Not no more.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You tell me. You tell me who went to the
B.I.A. – Bureau of Indian Annihilation and said I was messin’ with your
case, man. I don’t give a goddamn about your case.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: And I don’t give a goddamn about whether you
wear a badge or not, Crow Horse, but I didn’t cut you.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Still after Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: They found prints at Blue Legs’ place.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Yeah. Jimmy’s prints are there. But they
cross over Benjamin Black Star’s prints. And he wasn’t there until six
o’clock the mornin’ after to get eggs from the chickens. So Jimmy wasn’t
there til the next day. Follow?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Look, man… you better bust Jimmy and get
out before somebody shoots up more than your car next time.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Next time I’ll be ready. You get the word to
who ever it is.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: I can’t, Hoss. I don’t talk to
FBI’s.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You think you was sent here cuz you’re a
good cop?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No. I was sent here cuz I’m Indian. And a good
cop.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You ever think that maybe you was sent
here cuz the FBI’s need one good reason to take out the entire Warrior
Movement. And what better reason than one of their men, gettin’ blown
away on the res. A low-rent, expendable public servant sent in to take a
bullet for his country.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m sick of your shit –</p>
<p><strong>rancher</strong>: I’m sick of the two of ya timber niggers
spewin’ off.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Sorry, we don’t speak United States.</p>
<p><strong>rancher’s son</strong>: Yeah, well I do. Get the Jesus up,
and get the Jesus out or I’m gonna go out to my truck and come back with
my hardware.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Woh, hold on there, Jack, you’re –</p>
<p><strong>rancher’s son</strong>: – don’t “jack” me, Squanto. I’ll bury
your lazy ass right here.</p>
<p><strong>rancher’s son</strong>: I’m talkin’ to –</p>
<p><strong>brooks</strong>: No! No, you butt holes! He ain’t skin! He
AIN’T SKIN!</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Yeah he’s In’dn. Miniconjou Sioux.</p>
<p><strong>rancher’s son</strong>: You ain’t Indian?</p>
<p><strong>older rancher</strong>: What’s so damn funny?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Well, it’s just that the cavalry used to
always threaten the Lakota. The cavalry ain’t around anymore. The Lakota
still are.</p>
<p><strong>rancher’s son</strong>: I got no trouble tellin’ where you
come from, Fat Red.</p>
<p><strong>bar man</strong>: Sorry. On the house.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No plates. No registration. Serial numbers
removed. And all prints washed off by the river. That’s great. This is
turning out to be a walk in the park, do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Come back?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Ray. X22.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I read, Cooch.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Remember that upside down flag back at
Jimmy’s house? Somebody took it down.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: They took it down, set fire to it, and threw
it on the doorstep of room 13 at the Buffalo Butte Motel. Your room.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: We traced the number of the truck that dumped
it, and it belongs to one Maggie Sanders, also known as Maggie Eagle
Bear. She’s been all over the res, riling up the traditionals, telling
them not to break, and to keep Jimmy in hiding. She’s a problem now. And
she’s yours. Get her off the reservation.</p>
<p><strong>little girl</strong>: Are they all right under here?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Two-hundred and sixty-seven men, women, old
people. And little ones like you. Many killed running along that road
you see there.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Where were they runnin’ to?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: A place called The Stronghold. They died for
a dream. But you live. You are their great-great grandchildren and you
live. We have to honor their dream. Of protecting the Mother Earth. And
being proud of being Indian.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: My mother told me that they call us
Indians cuz Columbus was lookin’ for India when he discovered our
country.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Yeah, well, let me tell you something,
Henry: just be glad he wasn’t looking for Turkey.</p>
<p><strong>maggie’s pov</strong>: on the hill, a figure stands, hands in
his pockets, hair blowing in the wind. Ray.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Richard. Sing the Honoring Song with them.
I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: We’re praying at the grave. Do you wanna
join us?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, Maggie. But you’re gonna have to join me
for a ride. I’m taking you to Rapid City.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: So much power. I see it in your eyes. This…
hunger for power. Or for what you think is power.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You burned an American flag today. And left it
for me…</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: – You desecrated it, it had to be
burned.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I desecrated it?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: You forced an innocent man to run like an
animal. You’ve tried to poison my people’s hearts against me with your
manipulation, with letters I never wrote… you’ve been watching me eat,
work, raise my family… wash myself in the river. And now you’re here,
arresting me at a sacred place. In your eyes, that’s power.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: So I plant this tree for you. And I take all
this stuff that you’ve laid on me and my people, and I put it in this
hole with this pine cone. And I bury it. Cuz ya know what it is, Ray?
Bullshit. And shit is fertilizer. And The Mother will turn your lies
into something that lives.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: That’s what power is, in the Indian way.
Take me to Rapid, Ray. I’m the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: If I told you… that I think Jimmy’s innocent…
but I’m in over my head… would you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: See those Black Hills out there, Ray? When
the people lost the land in 1868, the government took everything but
those hills. They allowed us to keep those Black Hills, to live there.
Signed a treaty. Until they found gold. Then they told us we had to
leave because of National interest. They broke that treaty. Anyone who
fought or spoke out against it, wound up dead or in jail. And the people
wound up here. On a reservation.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: While up there, in the Black Hills… they
carved the faces of four presidents.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Your relatives must’ve taught you
something.</p>
<p><strong>no.</strong>: My father never told anybody he had Indian
blood. But he still used a few Indian words around the house. He called
me Washee. Said it meant… good boy.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Wa-shee is like… a dumpling. Like tallow we
put in stew. I think he was calling you chubby boy.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You ever see that car before?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Who’s it belong to?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Help me, Maggie…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I didn’t see you today, Maggie. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>maggie</strong>: Goodbye… Wa-shee.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Anyone who fought or spoke out against it…
wound up dead or in jail.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That was 1868, Maggie…</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: rain is coming down, and Maggie is getting the
children into the back of her truck. She helps them get a tarp over
their heads. Then as Yellow Bird pulls himself into the cab of the
truck, she hefts the wheelchair and two boys load it in.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Jesus, you alright?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah. I… I fell asleep. I can’t believe it. I
–</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Never turn your radio off! I thought I was
gonna find you scalped! Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sorry, Cooch. I lost Eagle Bear –</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: – never mind Eagle Bear. We’ve got Jimmy
nailed. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Where is he, Sam? Where’s Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: He’s a medicine man, Ray. The “spiritual
leader” of the Warriors. That right, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Trailer’s clean, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: You been the one making it rain like that,
out there, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, put that down.</p>
<p><strong>sherman</strong>: Can you make Jimmy outrun an M-16, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sherman!</p>
<p><strong>looks twice</strong>: Brother, the old man told me about you.
Listen to me: what was Leo trying to tell me? He wanted to meet me at
Maisy –</p>
<p><strong>fed</strong>: Save your speeches for prison, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Damn. That’s one hard running Indian.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: It’s over, Ray. I aged five years. But it’s
over. At least I’m gonna look like I’m ready for the advisory desk.
Let’s go get a beer.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Look… I’m not who you think I am. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: Out back that way… is a placed called
Wounded Knee.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: I was one years old there when our people
were shot down. My mother hid me in the snow in a blanket. One of those
killed was a Holy Man called Wakiyan Cante – Thunder Heart. They killed
him while he was running for The Stronghold. It is his blood – the same
blood that spilled on the grass and snow at Wounded Knee – that runs
through your heart like a buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>grandpa</strong>: Thunder Heart has come. Sent here to a
troubled place to help his people. That’s what I am told. Maybe you’re
right and I am mistaken. Your mind is young, mine is old. If so, so be
it. Ho Hecetu Yelo. I’ll speak no more.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Buffalo burgers and cold beer, Raymond. Don’t
worry about the sign out front… you don’t have to be Indian anymore.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: You have a fever. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Listen: when we get back tomorrow, you’re
gonna find Tully laying a promotion on you. S.A.C. He wants to prove
that his yuppie agents are making good. He’s offering you New York. Tell
him you want Atlanta.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Cuz I want New York.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Cooch. They sent us out here because the place
was being neglected. Now, all of a sudden, there’s two five man SWAT
teams out there tonight. Bell Huey choppers flying all over the place.
Federal occupation to catch one guy. Why, Cooch? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: National security, Ray. Get some sleep.
Tomorrow, we fly.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: the polaroid of the res car he gave to
Maggie earlier. She</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m looking for Richard Yellow Bird.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: The Washington Redskin. Thought you’d
be gone by now.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: What ya want?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Must be a bitch getting around in that
wheelchair. How long you been in it?</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: Since I got a iron pipe put across my
knees, man. Fight with three wasi’cus, ya know.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: At Sioux Falls Pen?</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: No, that was Leavenworth. This – was
Sioux Falls. What ya want?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Leavenworth a tough joint?</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: You ever try solitary confinement?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No. Can’t say that I have, Richard. Richard do
you know why I’m here?</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: Washington sent ya. I know that.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yes, Washington sent me, Richard. They sent me
here because this whole thing has been fucked. Do you know what I mean
when I say this whole thing has been fucked, Richard?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: An arrangement was made between you… and us. Do
you remember that arrangement?</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: I’m here, ain’t I?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Not for long, Richard. You got early parole
under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you
didn’t deliver.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: What the fuck you talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Get up out of the chair, Richard.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: What’s with you people? Why do ya have
to fuck with my head all the time? I came through, man.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Get up out of the chair, and walk toward the
backdoor, Richard.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: I get thrown in solitary until I don’t
know my own fuckin’ name, and then you people tell me I can beat nine
years if I help you. I helped you!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Get up!</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: They said I’d never see FBI again, and
I’m livin’ with you fuckers. I don’t feed ya information on the
Warriors, it’s back to the pen. I don’t do this, back to the pen. Your
word against my word. Against a con Indian’s word. I really got a
chance, man, right?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: They sent me here, Richard because they said
you didn’t hold up your end of the arrangement, and I have to transport
you back to Leavenworth.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: What the fuck, man? What do you people
want? I did what you wasi’cu’s told me to do.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Leo Fast Elk… is alive.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: No way. No fuckin’ way.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How the hell do you know?</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: I blew his back out with a buffalo gun,
that’s how I know! Now you’re gonna say I didn’t, so you can throw me
back in solitary?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The men who came to see you at Leavenworth. The
one’s who made the arrangement… who were they? Maybe I can talk to
them.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: Miles. Three other suits. That’s all I
know ’em as – suits. Were you there?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You turned Leo over on his face. But the
coyotes must’ve turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. It’s
out, and it knows.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: What do you know about spirits? You
ain’t no In’dn.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell
Jimmy. But you must not know how serious it was or you would have
delivered. Do you realize what Leo could have told Jimmy?! Do you?!</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: I took him out before he got the
chance. He didn’t say nothin’ about Tashka Sha. And now his spirit is in
the dirt. Forever.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s Tashka Sha, speak English, speak
English!</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: Red Deer Table! What’s with you,
man?</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: Wait a minute. Wait – what are you
doin’? You ain’t a FBI. You ain’t the law. Let me see your –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m the fucking law!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Keep talking, Yellow Bird…</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: All I know… is I did what I did… and I
ain’t in solitary, gettin’ pumped up with downer, gettin’ beat to shit.
But I tell you what, Suit. Take me back. Cuz I can’t take this shit no
more.</p>
<p><strong>yellow bird</strong>: Man, I don’t know who the fuck I am no
more.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You and me both.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Maggie!</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Five-hundred year old turtleshell
rattle…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Crow Horse, listen –</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Where’s Maggie? Where’d ya take her.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Nowhere. I’m trying to find her.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You got Jimmy. Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Crow Horse, listen. You have to come with
me.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Why? So you can get rid of me, too?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No. So we can do what the old man said. Red
Deer Table, Walter. We have to go.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Maybe the old man’s visions are still
strong.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Do they come in dreams, these visions?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Oh yeah. Dreams. Sometimes durin’
sickness. Vision quest. Sweat Lodge. Ya never know when.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just before we caught Jimmy… I had a dream that
I was being chased. And I was running with other people. Old- fashion
Indian people. I got shot in the back. Like Leo.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Where was this?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: At Wounded Knee. I mean, that’s where I was,
and that’s where the dream was. Why?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You were running with the old ones. At
The Knee. Heavy duty.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Well, it was just a dream, I –</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Sonuvabuck! What’s with you, Man? Who
are you?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Nothin’. Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You had a vision. You had yourself a
vision. A man waits a long time for a vision. Might go his whole
lifetime and never get one. And along comes some instant Indian with a
Mastercard and brand-new shoes, has himself a vision.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: I’m a full-blood Oglala.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’ve driven a long way. Where is this
place?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Maybe it was just a dream. Ya know, just
one of them, what do ya call ’em, fitful dreams?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah. Fitful dreams.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Bullshit. You had a vision. You got sign
from the old ones.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What the hell do you want me to do?!</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Ain’t prayer flags, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Jesus. Oil?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Uranium. Test holes. Somebody came in
from the Nebraska side, and did some shotgun testin’. They’re gettin’
ready to suck this baby dry.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: 1868…</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s what we’re doing here. National
interest. National security. Only this time it’s not gold. It’s
uranium.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: We’re standin’ on broken treaty ground,
Ray. This ain’t supposed to be here. It’ll poison the water.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Leo knew about it. Tried to tell Jimmy, get the
Warriors involved.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: So they took care of Leo.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Listen to the water… the river keeps goin’ down
then rising again.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: They’re drainin’ our water table. That’s
our life, man…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No. No…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: This Clear Moon’s house?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Yeah. It’s time to beat the drum. You
better wait here. He don’t trust the white man.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Alright. Shit’s comin’ down. He’s
callin’ council fire. All the old chiefs and the warriors, too. I gotta
be at Grandpa’s place in two hours. We need to get the tribe together.
We need to block this thing.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What we need… is Richard Yellow Bird.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: I thought it was a rare case of a
brother getting a break in the courts. We did an honorin’ song for him
and everything.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’s looking at a few hundred years in
Leavenworth. He’s not gonna come out without a fight.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: X21. Read. X21…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: X21. Come back.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Ray. What’s your 20?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Reservation.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: What are you doing on the reservation?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m on my way back in. Over.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Ray. Ray, don’t let go now, Man.
Ray…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You go to the council fire. I’m going back
in.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Ray.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Ray!</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Couldn’t sleep, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I had to finish something with Crow Horse.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: That’s where you were. You had to go back and
have it out with the Indian law…</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: You fucking hot head, we can get in trouble
for that.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Why didn’t you tell me what we were doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’re running a cover-up and you didn’t –</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: You ever put your hands on me again and
you’ll be doing the books for a baitshop in the fucking Everglades,
Mister.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You didn’t tell me about Red Deer Table –</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: – what the hell is Red Deer Table?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What is it? It’s genocide, that’s what it is.
It’s a Pay Zone for some U.S. corporation and a Dead Zone for the people
here. Uranium, Cooch.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Jesus Christ. What are you doing? What the
hell were you doing out there?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: This was a Selective Operations Unit, Agent
Levoi. There is classified information pertaining to our national
security. You don’t question that, you don’t go digging into that shit –
that’s insubordination. Jesus Christ –</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: – if they mine uranium there, these people will
have no place left to go…</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: We were sworn in on the Constitution to
protect federal matters, Ray. I don’t know about uranium, I don’t know
about Red Dog Table – all I know is we did our job. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We neutralized anybody with a voice. Leo,
Jimmy… Eagle Bear. Anyone who was standing in the way of the land. Is
that it?</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: No. We neutralized enemies of the United
States. Anti-American radicals who have killed federal officers out
here!</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Jesus, Ray. You think I don’t like the
Indians? Not true. These were noble people but their day is gone.
They’re a conquered nation. They want all of America back but they can’t
even keep the garbage out of their own front yards. It’s sad, Ray. But
it’s just the way it is. We have to function as a colonial police force
out here.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: You gentlemen ready – hi, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Yeah, we’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: Ah, there you are. The Sioux.</p>
<p><strong>clear moon</strong>: You got the troublemakers off our land.
Good, Was-te.</p>
<p><strong>in his mirror</strong>: a car has pulled out from behind the
shack. CROW HORSE observes this. Then twists the fuel throttle hard.</p>
<p><strong>ray�s pov</strong>: swerving and reckless as he races
forward. Sherman, walking around to one of the cars has to run out of
the way. The other agents clear out, looking in confusion as Ray cuts a
hard U – sweeps PAST THE BAR, SMASHES INTO AND THROUGH the old hitching
post – and HEADS TOWARD the reservation which lies vast before him.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: No, damn it. You call teams in and this is
gonna be a fucking media event. Get me three cars, six agents, block all
reservation exits. It’s under control.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Crow Horse!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Crow Horse!</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Ain’t no Council Fire, Brother. Clear
Moon…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I know. Come on. We gotta get off the
reservation or we’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Hoka Hey. It’s a good day to die.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Bullshit, let’s get outta here,</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Grandpa…</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: X21, please read. Ray. Ray. X21, please read.
This is Cooch. Please come in, Ray. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: He hasn’t left this place in twenty
years. They got him.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: X21. Ray. Ray, please come in.</p>
<p><strong>miles</strong>: We have a renegade agent, Cooch? He gets off
the reservation…</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: – he’s not getting off the reservation.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: They got us sealed. What are we gonna
do?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’re going for The Stronghold.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Ray. Can you hear me? You are fucked. There’s
no way out of this. If you won’t listen to your own laws, then listen to
this: This is President Clear Moon. This nation does not want your
sympathy. You cannot use this reservation as a sanctuary. Stop where you
are now.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Whatever you are trying to do is futile,
Raymond. You have nothing. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yellow bird… is gonna sing.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Yellow Bird committed suicide at three
o’clock this morning. Some gung-ho agent from D.C. pushed him into a
corner. You’re playing a losing game. Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>recorder</strong>: How the hell do you know? I blew his back
out with a buffalo gun, that’s how I know. And now you’re gonna say I
didn’t and put me back in solitary?!</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: You people tol’ me I could beat nine years if
I helped you. I helped you! I could beat nine years if I helped you. I
helped you!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Walter.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: The Stronghold – a narrow opening in hulking
rock formations. Large enough for a car to get in, and keep followers
out.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: That’s it. The Stronghold. Get us in
there, we got a chance.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’re in there. We’re in there –</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Crow Horse, get your face in the dirt. Ray…
come forward. Let it go. Let’s just let it go…</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Come on, Ray. Come forward.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No way, Cooch.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Ray. I’m coming to talk to you. I’m gonna
walk you out of here. And we’re gonna get the hell outta this place.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re right, Cooch. It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>chasing hawk</strong>: All the exits are blocked. There’s two
more fed cars tryin’ to get in. And some press.</p>
<p><strong>cooch</strong>: Ray…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Let the press through.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: The people are already talkin’ about
their vote for a new tribal prez. They wanna vote for Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What about the water…</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You bought her some time, Kola. Ain’t
never gonna be over… but you bought her some time.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Some Indian time?</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Indian time.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Where ya gonna go, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll have to see what the visions say about
that one.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: You didn’t have another vision…</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Yeah, right here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You take care.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: If you ever need a place to come back to
and listen to the trees a little… we’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: Ain’t no word in Sioux for goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>crow horse</strong>: We will be here.</p>
