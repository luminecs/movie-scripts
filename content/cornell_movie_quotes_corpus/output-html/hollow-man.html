<h1 id="hollow-man">hollow-man</h1>
<p><strong>fade in:</strong>: On complete darkness. A SMALL DOOR swings
open. A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the length of
a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a gloved hand dangling a rat.
The hand shoves the frightened rat into the tube and closes the door
behind it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to pad down
the tube s length. After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly
lit cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops. The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING
whispers in the rat s ears. The rat turns round to head back down the
tube, but a door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle. The rat cowers
as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING. The rat s head jerks around, looking
for signs of danger, but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish
on the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and dashes toward it.
But an invisible force descends. The rat squeals in agony as something
smashes down on its body, crushing it. A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the
rat flies into the air, halting a few feet off the ground. Its body
writhes, struggling against the unholy force. Then a sick crunch of tiny
bones snapping. All life quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead
eyes… The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white fur of the
rat explodes in a shower of blood. HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear,
as do the red-slicked ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites
again into the rat.</p>
<p><strong>int. bedroom - night</strong>: In the background we hear Jay
Leno s monologue from the Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a
computer screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with the
shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry framed and wearing
only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips coffee from an Einstein coffee mug. He
peers at a complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his screen.
He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts slightly, then falls apart.
Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the cellophane and
sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard with renewed vigor. Another
molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s fingers fly across the
keyboard. The molecule blinks on and off, it trembles and twists
apart.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Damnit. Sebastian pears out his window.
Across the courtyard, a light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees
a BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her living room.
The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses it and then begins to
undress. Sebastian loans over to the window, getting interested. But
when the brunette reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window
and lowers her shades. SEBASTIAN Damnit. Sebastian leans back in his
chair and closes his eyes. He s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and
stares up at the ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big
red letters is a brief reminder - You Should Be Working. Sebastian
sighs, leans forward and begins pecking away again.</p>
<p><strong>later:</strong>: The television is now only static. We pan by
his alarm clock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his
computer. He gets an idea… slides back in his chair. Types away again.
The molecule reforms on the computer screen. He types a few more keys,
waits, watches the molecule. Nothing happens. He hits a few more keys
and watches intently for a reaction.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I am a goddamn genius. He hits a few more
keys and a telephone keypad appears on the screen. He dials.</p>
<p><strong>int. another bedroom - night</strong>: Digital phone rings.
In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a deep sleep. As she
straggles out of bed and over to her desk, we notice a young man
sleeping next to her. The ringing continues. She moves her computer
mouse around and her screen comes to life. She click on a telephone icon
and the ringing stops. A beat later, Sebastian appears in a window on
her screen.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian, do you know what time it is?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You know Da Vinci never slept. Said it
was waste of time.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What is it this time?</p>
<p><strong>intercut: sebastian s bedroom</strong>: Sebastian peers at
the image of Linda in the computer window. He notices something behind
her in the bed, the young man sleeping face down.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Who s that? Linda pulls the camera off
the top of the of the computer screen and positions it so Sebastian can
t see the bed.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Not your business. Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Touche.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: So you calling about anything in particular,
or were you just hoping to catch me sleeping in the nude?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I cracked the reversion. Upon hearing
this, Linda receives a jolt of adrenaline.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You cracked it?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Look at this. Sebastian hits a couple of
keys. A moment later the molecular structure appears on Linda s
computer.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: 91% sure.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Eleven months with no progress and you
suddenly come up with it out of the blue? How?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: The usual. Coffee and twinkies.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I hate you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I know. You think you could hunt down
Matt and get to the lab early. I want Isabelle prepped for a live
test.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah, I think I can find him. What are you
going to do?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Well y know. It s daylight in
Switzerland. I gotta call the Nobel Committee and tell them to get our
prizes ready. See you in a few. ON LINDA S COMPUTER SCREEN as Sebastian
clicks off. Linda crosses to her bed, and shakes the guy awake.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hey… come on. DR. MATTHEW KENSINGTON, late
20s too, stirs from under sheets.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian just called. We gotta get to the
lab. Matt bolts up.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Shit! You didn t tell him I was here, did
you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Give me some credit, will ya.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: So what s the rush?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He cracked reversion. Matt pulls his jeans
on.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Wanna ride down?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We better take our own cars.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You re gonna have to tell him about us
eventually.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I know. It s just You re his best friend. He
ll feel betrayed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. washington d.c. skyline - day</strong>: From a distance,
the Nation s Monuments stand awash in the harsh light of morning. CAMERA
finds a BLACK PORSCHE as it pulls to the security fence of a warehouse.
The imposing structure is surrounded by a chainlink fence and barbed
wire. The Porsche is waved through security and heads straight into the
warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>int. warehouse -day</strong>: The Porsche pulls to a halt in
a reserved parking space and Sebastian exits, wearing a Hawaiian shirt,
shorts, and Birkenstocks. He notes the other cars parked in the lot,
then crosses to bunker in the center of the warehouse, guarded by a
MARINE, shouldering an M-16.</p>
<p><strong>marine guard</strong>: Morning, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Morning, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>marine guard</strong>: Your team s in early. Something
special going on?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Sorry, Ed. You know the rules. Sebastian
presses his thumb against a glass screen. A laser reads his print. Scan
readout: CAINE, SEBASTIAN Clearance: ALPHA ALPHA THREE Division:
CLASSIFIED The doors whisk open and Sebastian steps inside.</p>
<p><strong>marine guard</strong>: Have a good day, sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. elevator - day</strong>: Inside the elevator is a
numberless keypad. Sebastian taps in his floor code.</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: Authorization please.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Caine zero zero two seven.</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: Authorization verified. Good morning,
Dr. Caine. The elevator descends with a groaning hum. It passes below us
and keeps descending into the belly of the earth, the shaft goes down
forever.</p>
<p><strong>int. habitat s corridor</strong>: We slowly push down a
hallway panelled by Plexiglas chambers. Each chamber looks as if it s
tailored for a specific animal, although no animals are visible. As we
pass one habitat, something slams into the Plexiglas and begins barking.
Another HOWL joins in. Then SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with
a dozen animal cries. THUMP.</p>
<p><strong>thump.</strong>: The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates
as if angry animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals are
seen. Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES revealing
heat signatures of the various animals, but they remain invisible to the
naked eye. MATT taps on a sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another
seemingly empty cage.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Isabelle … The woodchips on the floor shift
and suddenly the Plexiglas steams up right in front of Matt s face. The
Plexiglas begins to shake violently. MATT Calm down baby. Calm down. It
s okay… Matt takes a pair of thermal goggles from his belt and pulls
them down over his eyes. THERMAL POV - A rather large heat signature,
ape-like in shape, rattles about the cage. Matt slowly unlatches the
Plexiglas door and reaches inside. MATT It s okay, baby. It s okay. I m
not going to hurt you. Come here. THERMAL POV - he reaches out to the
creature. He grabs hold of it, firmly. Stroking it. The creature COOS.
Matt reaches for a hypo and brings it up to the creature. MATT Just hold
still. Something clamps down on his hand, breaking his skin. Blood
erupts in a bite pattern. MATT Ow, shit. Matt drops the hypo and falls
back. The cage door flies open and something runs out. Matt pulls
himself up to see the heat signature running down the hallway. He turns
around to see another heat signature coming at him. Matt pulls off his
goggles to see Linda coming up the Corridor.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: She bit me.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yeah. She s become a lot more aggressive in
the last few days. Linda takes the goggles from Matt. LINDA Go take care
of that bite. I ll get her.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: And give you a chance to pull ahead? Never.
Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and pulls out a two
tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt.</p>
<p><strong>around the corner</strong>: A slight distortion shimmers as
something runs past us. We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS. Looking down the
shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a haunting heavy breathing. The
control door is closed though and something large and angry is throwing
itself against it. We can t see anything. A few moments later, Linda and
Matt round the corner, wearing goggles and leveling their pistols.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Shh. Be vewy, vewy quiet. I m hunting simians.
heheheheh.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Knock it off. Isabelle! THERMAL POV - Dark
hallway. Movement. A red shimmering heat signature. It comes running at
Linda. HOWLING. Linda fires. A T-DART flies. Thwack… It stops in
mid-air. Then falls. But it doesn t hit the floor. Instead, it stops
inches above the ground. THERMAL POV - the heat signature lies in a heap
at Linda s feet.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Good shootin , Tex.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What s that make it?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I m still ahead. 6 to 5. Like a smug
gunfighter, Linda blows imaginary smoke from the top of her tranquilizer
gun.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: But I m catching up.</p>
<p><strong>int. corridor - day</strong>: The elevator doors open and
Sebastian steps out. He s met by SARAH KENNEDY, early thirties, a fiery
red-head.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Can I have a word?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Most normal people say good morning.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don t you think you should test the protocol
on the liver samples before you inject Isabelle?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How many tissue samples have we
successfully regressed? Hundreds, right? How many have gone on to work
on the full system? None.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That s beside the point.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No, that is the point. I m not going to
waste six months of my life on an outmoded testing procedure. This thing
works. I know it. I feel it. Linda comes down the corridor, listening in
on the tail end of the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Fine. You can mop up afterward.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You think I m going to kill Isabelle?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Kill? More like liquefy.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Sarah, thank you for your opinion, but I
m the project leader. Understand? She says …</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yes, Sir. … but somehow it feels like Fuck
you. She storms off. Sebastian turns to Linda.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How did you ever convince me to hire
her?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You said you wanted the beat vet in the
country.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yeah, well she cares more about the
animals than the research.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Maybe that s why she s so good.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: CLOSE ON: MATT as he shuts off the spinning
cyclotron. As it s spinning slows to a halt, he pops the top and reaches
in, removing…</p>
<p><strong>a glowing vial of orange liquid.</strong>: Sebastian peers at
the vial.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Who da Man? You da Man.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: As we pull out we see we are.</p>
<p><strong>int. laboratory - day</strong>: Almost feels like a dungeon.
Think high-tech Frankenstein. Walls lined with video displays, technical
readouts, bizarre medical equipment. On a table in the middle of the
room, a sheet drapes over a humanoid form, strapped down at it s
invisible limbs. The straps move slightly… ghostly. Wires lead from the
body to lots of machinery.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Protocol is hot.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Vitals? Sarah, checks over the various
readouts … heartbeat, blood pressure, the rest.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Normal. CARTER ABBEY, the late thirties lab
assistant, wheels in a cart of equipment. Linda taken a seat by the
table and pushes aside the sheet.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How many times do I have to tell you,
Frank you aren t God. I am.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sorry, Boss. Forgot. Sebastian glance up at a
glass booth overlooking the Laboratory floor. TWO PEOPLE in the
booth.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You guys ready to roll?</p>
<p><strong>int. observation booth</strong>: FRANK CHASE, early thirties,
and tech expert JANICE WALTON, early twenties, man a small booth above
the lab. They re dressed more like band roadies than scientists. The
room is crammed with electronic and recording equipment. A handful of
monitors display different images of the lab. Thermal and regular video.
Another screen monitors vital signs.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We are live and in color. On your mark. Frank
and Janice looks down on their colleagues. Sebastian nods their way.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Okay. Roll em.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Okay. We are rolling record on videos one
through twelve. Frank hits a series of buttons and speaks into a
microphone. Recording.</p>
<p><strong>int. laboratory - day</strong>: Frank s voice echoes through
the chamber.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Subject Isabelle Two. Currently in phase
shift… one hundred twenty six days, eighteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Testing De-Phase protocol. Injecting serial
protein Caine One Two Five. Linda removes a glowing vial of orange
liquid from a centrifuge nearby.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Maybe if you stopped naming them after
yourself, you d have better luck.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Why thank you, Dr. Kensington, for that
keen scientific observation. I ll be sure to include it in my
memoirs.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: A whole mention? And I thought I was just
gonna be a footnote. Matt unwraps a hypodermic needle and jabs the
needle into the vial, drawing up the colored liquid.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Okay. Frank and Janice monitor Isabelle s
vitals.</p>
<p><strong>int. laboratory - day</strong>: Tension in the air.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ready. She wraps a bungee cord around
nothing and pulls it tight. She then takes some dye and sprays it. A
surface appears, floating beneath the restraints. It sheens in the light
as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps the surface several times. A
small bulge appears, like a vein.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Propped.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Let s make some history. Matt lowers the hypo
to the vein. But Sebastian takes the hypo from Matt s hand.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Nice try, Sparky. Matt relinquishes the
needle.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Come on, Isabelle. You can do this. Sebastian
lowers the hypo. The skin bonds and gives. The needle remains in sight
after it slips through the visible surface. Matt presses down on the
hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream. The gold liquid
twists into a long snaking tube up and down the limb. It s the shape of
a vein. The liquid begins to react. Small flashes of light blip up and
down the strand of color. Ba-bump.. ba-bump… the heartbeat starts to
speed up.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Elevated heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>int. observation booth</strong>: Janice analyzes the
screens.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: We re still in the green.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Confirmed. Vitals still in the normal
range.</p>
<p><strong>int. laboratory</strong>: The glowing liquid turns from gold
to red as the complex webbing of a bloodstream appears.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It s reacting. Spreading out from the
bloodstream, soon becomes visible.. the shadow of a skeletal system.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Do you see this?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It s working. It s actually working. Matt
pulls the sheet back. Muscles are beginning to appear. And eyeballs.
Frightened eyeballs.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Heart rate s up. She s scared. Sarah soothes
her. SARAH It’s okay, baby. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Subject began manifesting almost
Immediately. Protocol is reacting quickly. Isabelle starts to struggle
against her restraints. She begins to howl.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Subject may be in pain or extreme
discomfort.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Goddamnit. Blood pressure elevating. Brain
activity going through the roof. The brain appears, seemingly growing
from the inside out. The shape of a large half-formed monkey grows from
the inside out. A SKULL APPEARS howling in pain, in horror. SARAH We ve
got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What? What problem! Sarah checks her
monitors.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It s her heart. We can see the heart beating
in the ape s</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I got an erratic heart beat.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: She s going into cardiac arrest.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Got the crash cart. Carter charges the crash
cart and rolls it in.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We re losing her. Her machine flatlines.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No! It s got to work. The body is only
half there. It looks as if its caught in decomposition. Linda rubs the
cardiac paddles together.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Clear! Linda slams the paddles on the monkey
s chest. The jolt of electricity makes the monkey visible again for a
brief moment. Then the skin and flesh fade away again.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We ve got something! The heartbeat starts up
again. The body continues its march toward,visibility. SARAH Still.
erratic.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Come on Isabelle. Come on. You can do it. You
can fucking do it. Everybody s pulling for her.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Come on, monkey.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Do it. Do it. Come on. Muscles spread like a
rash on bone as the monkey twists and turns, frightened. Then skin. The
monkey howls. Skin forms over the muscles reappearing like it was being
painted on before our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Stabilizing. The entire form glows, then
blinks, then glows again, as if it was discharging some stored
energy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Brain activity returning to normal. The
monkey grunts and groans. Blinks its eyes. Linda hovers over it stroking
its fur.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Welcome back, Isabelle. Sebastian puts his
hand on Linda s shoulder… a move that does not go unnoticed by Matt. We
did it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I think she s gonna be okay</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Amazing. She’s normal, absolutely healthy.
If you didn’t know any better, you’d think nothing had happened to
her.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yeah. I can’t wait to slice up her brain and
trace her neural pathways.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Screw you, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well maybe not right away.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We should celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: To the finest research team I’ve ever
known.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I thought you’d gone.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Where would I go?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: A little “I am become death… the shatterer of
worlds”?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Since the day I met, all you wanted to do was
change the world.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Actually it does. I guess since you were
there from the beginning, you know me better than anyone else on this
godforsaken planet.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re positively maudlin. You should be
happy. Do you have any idea what you’ve accomplished?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yeah… but I was working so hard, I didn’t
realize I’d have no one to share it with.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Nothing. It’s just… He is who he is.
Sometimes I just have to be reminded.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What’s it like? Talk goddamnit! Tell me
what it’s like!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Six years ago, this committee
commissioned me with a very specific task…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: To successful phase-shift a human being
out of quantum sync with the visible universe and then return him
safely, with no after affects.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: But now?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: But now… But now, we feel we are closer
than ever to resolving this issue. We’ve been experimenting with a new
regression formula that looks rather promising. A FOUR STAR GENERAL
leans forward.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Son, as you can imagine, we are very
anxious to field test this tactical asset. How long till you resolve
this issue?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Shouldn’t be more than another year,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yo. Reality check! What the hell was that
about?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: The protocol works. Why’d you tell them it
didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I wasn’t ready for them to know.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: But they’re the oversight committee. They’re
supposed to know.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m sure he had a reason. You did have a
reason, didn’t you, Sebastian?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I had more than a reason. I had a goddamn
epiphany.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s their money, Sebastian. It’s going to
happen eventually.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I know. But not yet. There’s too much for
us to learn. I don’t want my hands tied by their political agenda when
we go to phase three.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well, then… mind telling us how you’re gonna
get a human test-subject for phase three without the committee finding
out?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: That’s easy. I’ve decided to test the
procedure …</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: … on myself.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Was Jonas Salk nuts?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah. Pretty sure he was.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: And remember, for every Jonas Salk, there
are a bunch of guys who aren’t famous cuz they died.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: If we’re that unsure, how can we morally
justify testing it on someone else?</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Isn’t it a little soon to be moving into
phase three anyway?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: She’s right. We haven’t even finished
collating the phase two research.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: We’ll have plenty of time to collate and
cross-reference later. Monkey data doesn’t matter anyway. The only real
data is human data.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You don’t even know if any of the protocols
will work on humans.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How are we gonna find out? Besides, we’ve
succeeded with a gorilla and their DNA is 98% the same as humans. And
the 2% is not that significant.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian … humans can talk, build houses and
cook in microwave ovens. Gorilla’s live in trees. That’s a helluva 2% if
you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: We’re all concerned. I know that. But if
we’re gonna move forward ever, this is something we have to do.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why you? Why not one of us?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: The risks. I couldn’t ask…</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What if we volunteer?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What if you’re too valuable to lose?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m Project Leader. It’s my formula and
my call. The best way to express your concern is to make damn sure you
do your best work. I’ll want about four weeks to…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: To put your affairs in order?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: To run some more reversions and tissue
tests and then we’ll attempt the phase shift. I’ll stay shifted for
three days of testing and then we’ll perform a quantum regression.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: In the past six years, I’ve never once
challenged your decisions, but this … Sebastian. I don’t think you
should do this.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh please. How long were we together? You
must’ve said it a million times … Nobody knows who built the lunar
lander. All they remember in the first man on the moon.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Lin, trust me… nothing’s going to
happen.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He refuses to listen to reason.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Can we talk about this later? I’m trying to
make love to you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sorry. I just can’t let it go.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I know how you’re feeling. Hell, he and I’ve
been friends since freshman year.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: So how can we let him do this?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What if you were given the opportunity to be
the first person on ,Mars, would you go?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: In a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What if they didn’t know whether or not they
could get you home?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Let me ask another question.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Is about who gets to be on top?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Is the human race really ready for what we’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Why do you always get philosophical before
we’re about to get physical?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No really. Is it ready? We’re barrelling down
a road that begs moral and ethical questions that I don’t think we can
answer.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: They said the same thing about the bomb. They
said we’d never survive the nuclear age… but here we are.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This night is still young. I mean, when you
think about it, it’s creepy. Do we really want to live in a world where
people can just disappear in the blink of an eye?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We made our deal with the devil years ago.
Might as well stick around to cash in.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’s not too late to back out. I’m happy to
take your place.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No. I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Nervous?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Ever tell you the one about Superman and
Wonder Woman?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: So Superman’s flying around the city, and he’s
horny as hell. Lo and behold he looks down and sees Wonder Woman,
completely nude, sunning herself up on the roof of the Justice League. I
mean she is lying there naked and spread eagle. So Superman starts
thinking, “man… this is too easy. I could go down there, do a little
fast pumping and be gone before she even sees me.” After all he is
faster than a speeding bullet, right? Anyway, he swoops down, takes care
of business so quick, you can’t even see him. Well … I tell ya. Wonder
Woman looks up, surprised as hell and says “What the hell was that.” And
the Invisible Man replies “I dunno know, but it sure hurt like
hell.”</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You know, that could be the last joke I
ever hear.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: C’mon, man. That’s funny shit.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: O.K. How’re you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Pulse 88, BP 140 over 95. A bit elevated.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: To be expected.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No reason for concern. He’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Hey… it’s gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Start recording.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: We’re hot. All systems nominal, Houston.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay, kids. Let’s make some history.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Subject: Male, Age 29, weight 166 lbs.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’ll inject myself. If anything goes
wrong, they can’t blame you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We can still shut down, Sebastian.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Any last words?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yeah. If I’m killed, pretend I said
something deep and clever.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Injection was administered at … 18:23:47.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Nothing so far.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Vitals are stable.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Nothing’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Human DNA structure is slightly more complex…
it’s possible that it may take more time…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Maybe we overlooked something.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Recheck the protocol. It can’t be non-
reactive.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Kinda like a firecracker with a bad
fuse…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No change in bio-electric.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Shit… it’s starting to burn… Oh god. It
hurts. I didn’t think it would hurt.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Heartbeat’s elevated. Pulse at 100. … 130
…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What do you feel? Keep talking. KEEP</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Pain!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Pulse is 165 … 170 Blood pressure 180 over
100. …</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: He’s going to blow out his heart.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Prop the crash cart.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We’ve got to stop it!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We can’t!</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Something’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Listen up! Electric activity increasing in
all limbs. Brainwaves are through the roof.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: I didn’t think the human brain could spike
that high.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe it can’t.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Pulse is 180 …. holding stable.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Pulse is dropping. 170.. 150 …. 160..</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Bio-quantum phase shift occurred at
18:26.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No. He passed out from the trauma.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Vitals returning to normal. Pulse 110 …
dropping. Blood pressure 130 over 75.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Electrical activity is stabilizing.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Pulse steady at 70.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Un-fucking-believable.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You did it, Sebastian. You’re the first.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Let’s get him into recovery.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: S’okay. You nodded off.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: His breathing’s hypnotic. How long’s it
been?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Seventeen hours.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Where are the others?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: In the lab crunching numbers. We’ve got enough
data there for two lifetimes of research.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I keep looking at that hole, wondering if
he’s really there.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He may be coming out of it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: The lights! Turn off the goddamn
lights! Ah Christ!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Your eyelids are transparent.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: So I … I’m…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: My arms. I can.. where? … I can
feel them…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Your arms … your whole body… It worked,
Sebastian. It worked.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Mirror. I … I want to see.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Over here in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: I … It’s hard to think.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It was painful?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: At first… but then everything
went black. I couldn’t see or hear or feel anything. It was all just
black… like I wasn’t connected.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Your system received quite a shock.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: At least my senses are starting
to return… You’re wearing your Shalimar, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: This is weird. I’m looking
through myself at the floor. I’m looking right through myself. I can’t
tell …</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sebastian?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: You really can’t see me. Can
you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Gimme symptoms. Dizziness, nausea, headache,
body-ache, disorientation.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: No, just tired. It’s funny. I can
see everything… more than before… but I can’t see myself.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Hey. How’s he doing?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why don’t you ask him?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sebastian, how do you feel.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Not to bad, considering.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He can’t close his eyes so they’re sensitive
to light.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: So, what was it like?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Over here.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: C’mon Sebastian. Knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Sorry. Couldn’t resist.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I feel like we’re playing Marco Polo.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Well, I see the procedure hasn’t changed your
personality.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No worries. I’m on it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Boy, you people have no sense of
humor.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Stop there.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Index Mark. 112125.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s late. Time you got some rest.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Just a little longer.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hate to pull rank, but you’re my patient now
and you need rest. We’ve got a busy day tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We’ve set up a thermal camera for observation
and I’ve arranged one of us to be here 24/7 in case you need anything.
The team’s gonna be on alpha- call alert for the duration. If anything
goes wrong, we can all be here within…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Thirty minutes. Yes,,_I know. I
wrote the procedure.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I was trying to be reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: You like this don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Being in charge.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Please. I’m just doing my job.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A video screen. A thermal lump lays
stretched out on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You gonna be okay?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Fine. It’s not like I have anything else
going on in my sad pathetic life.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Carter’ll be in at six to spell you and I’ll
be in by nine. Call me if anything happens, okay?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m fine. Go on ahead.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Man, I’m tired. That was a long day.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Days only get longer from here.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Sarah. Are you awake?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are you in
here?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Dr. Caine, please report in.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Dr. Caine, report in please!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I found him later in the lab, running
samples.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Why didn’t you call me?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Because I wasn’t sure. I’m still not. I mean,
I could’ve easily been dreaming.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It doesn’t sound like something Sebastian
would do.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: God, I feel so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I can talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. I mean… It was probably nothing. I
shouldn’t’ve mentioned it.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yeah, I’m sure. I mean, y’know, why would he
do that, right? Just, this place at night can be kinda creepy,
y’know.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: So, how was your first night?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Restless. Hard to sleep when you
can’t close your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yeah? What’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Got up a couple of times. Knocked
about.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Yeah, Sarah mentioned you weren’t in your
cubicle. She said she called you over the intercom and you didn’t
respond.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I guess I didn’t hear. I had the radio
on.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’d be helpful to us if you’d tell whoever’s
on duty where you’re going to. I mean, if something were to happen, we’d
want to know where to find you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I didn’t think it was a problem.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It isn’t. I just don’t want it to become
one.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Next I want to run a VV and UVF
analysis of the platelets.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We’ll have to draw some more blood.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yeah. Why?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You just seem a little nervous.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. I…I’m fine. Hold still. This might hurt a
bit.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: No. I was looking at the clock.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Just felt like someone was staring at me.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian? Goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: You’ve no idea how much fun I’ve
had. I’m going to hate going back.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s what worries me.?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What happens when we turn the project over to
the Army. Ever wonder how much fun they’re gonna have?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Maybe we won’t give it to them.
His voice comes from behind her now.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Stop it, Sebastian. It’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Well, don’t do it for me. Do it
for science.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Grow up.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Oh well. Missed your big
chance.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Got some sleep. Big day tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Recording?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Recording. Subject Doctor Sebastian Caine.
Currently in phase shift… Three days, seven hours.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: De-Phase protocol. Injecting Serial Protein
Caine One Two Seven.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Not really. I was just starting to enjoy
myself.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Tough.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Okay, man. Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Wait… something… something
doesn’t feel right.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Heartbeat elevated.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Vitals still nominal..</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I can’t br… br…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He’s not breathing.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Subject manifesting.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Pulse erratic.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Carter!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Get a tranq. Stat.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s reverting. Got him on the table.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I got no pulse. No pulse.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Start CPR.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Getting a pulse.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Holy shit. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian… can you hear me? Can you hear me?
How are his pupils?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I can’t see his goddamn pupils!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I think he’s going into shock.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Just got the tissue sample results. Cellular
cohesion is stable.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Guess so. I was just thinking about the
Apollo missions. Y’know? Grissom, White and Chaffee… What it was like
for them on that launch pad that day, thinking they were gonna reach the
stars only to burn to death.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sometimes the test pilots make history.
Sometimes the planes crash and people die.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: But he didn’t die, did he? What if we can’t
bring him back? What then?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’s just a little hitch is all. He’ll be the
first to tell that he’ll crack it and I’m sure he will. It’ll just take
time. Listen, let’s got out of here. We could drive up to the old
observatory. We’ll take some wine and go count the stars and forget all
this for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No. I want to be here for him.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: So I guess it didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: You look worried. It must’ve been
bad.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You almost died.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Well, remember your Nietchze.
Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I should be making you feel better. Not vice
versa.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: I guess if I’m going to be stuck
this way for awhile, I’d better make some adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Not too bad.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: The latex’ll limit the amount of light
delivered to my optic nerves.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You could almost pass for human.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Well, it gives you a face to talk
to at least, and we can all work in normal light again.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: The testing’s making me sick.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Could be the barium or the radiation.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You’re physiology has changed and, well, all
bets are off.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I can’t believe I have to spend another
night here. Suppose you’re gonna go home now, meet up with that
boyfriend of yours now.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Do you want me to stay?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No. That’s okay. It’s just, being a
guinea pig is more work than I thought. I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Dr. Caine. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Just stopped by to let you know, I’m
going out for a bit.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Going out? Hey wait a sec!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: What do you mean going out for a bit?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: If I don’t get out of here, I’m gonna go
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: But you’re not supposed to leave the
compound.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: That’s the rule.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yes, but I made that rule. It’s my rule
and I’m changing it.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You can’t just change it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Carter, I was suppose to be like this for
three days. Three fucking days and I’ll be damned if I’m going to spend
the rest of my life as a prisoner in this godforsaken dump. Now I’m
going out. I’ll be back in a couple of hours. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yeah, it’s Carter. We got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>marine guard</strong>: Hey, Doc. Haven’t seen you for
awhile?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Yeah, well. You know how it in
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>marine guard</strong>: You got that right, sir. I was
beginning to worry ’cause your car hadn’t moved.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Thanks, but everything’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He could be anywhere. Hell he could be right
behind us.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’ll meet you at the lab. I’m gonna swing by
his place, just in case.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: See you there.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t want him to see.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What a mess.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: What are the tranqs for?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Use your imagination.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Are you saying he’s dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We’re just saying we need to be cautious.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: The Metro stops running after midnight and
he’s on foot, so he can’t have gotten too far.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Look, this isn’t a monkey we’re talking
about. It’s Dr. Caine. Don’t you think you’re over reacting?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This program is classified. If he’s out there
it means someone might find out about him. He could destroy the whole
program.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Relax, Linda. No one’s gonna find
out.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Where the hell have you been?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I got a little stir crazy, so I went to
my apartment to pick up some stuff.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Bullshit! I went to your apartment and I
happen to know you did a helluva lot more than pick some stuff up.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You, of all people How could you?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Just what did you see in my
apartment?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I saw your face and your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It was bad enough you left without an escort,
but to take off the… out in public?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Don’t make a mountain out of molehill. I
didn’t let anyone see me.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s not good enough. When you’re outside
the lab there are a thousand variables none of us can control. It’s just
not safe for you to be out there.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Come on, Linda. You don’t expect me to be
some kind of prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You volunteered for this, Sebastian. You knew
going in there could be consequences. For the security of this project,
I’m gonna have to ask you to confine yourself to the compound.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m still Project Leader, Linda. It’s my
decision to make.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re right. It’s your decision. But if you
leave the compound again, I’ll notify the oversight committee. Then they
can make the decision. You understand?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Matt?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sorry, man. You’d do the same if it were the
other way around.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Pack ’em up… Everyone go home.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Hold still.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: How much blood do you think you’ve taken
so far?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Not enough to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Every day… feels like you’re sucking me
dry.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: The shoe being on the other foot. You
getting to run things.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I didn’t ask for this, Caine. But when a
classified experiment disappears in the middle of the night, someone’s
gotta run the show. Look, I know how hard this has been for you.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Don’t patronize me. And for the record,
you’ve got no idea what it’s like. I get up every morning and you people
stick needles in me. You bombard me with radiation until I vomit. And
then at six it’s over for you. You get to go home. But Sebastian is
still here. Sebastian can’t leave, or else. That’s the worst part, you
know. Here I have this … this GIFT and I can’t even use it.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Now it’s a gift?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You’re goddamn right it’s a gift. And if
you weren’t so goddamned short sighted, I’d be out there right now
trying to master it.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Where’re you going?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Looks like I’m going nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Come on, man. We’ve got a ton of tests
scheduled today.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Do them yourself.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: “We are the hollow men, the stuffed men,
headpieces filled with straw.”</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Funny, huh? I’ve become a literal
metaphor.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t want to fight you. I just want what’s
best for the program.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I know. And you being right doesn’t make
it any easier for me.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You can be scared. That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m not scared of being stuck this way.
With a little more make-up and practice, I could… … pass. Y’know, get by
in the world. But the testing…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You’re talking like you’ve given up. It’s
only been a few months.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What if it’s years? I don’t know how much
more testing I can take.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: 60% reversion. 70% … 75% … 80% … 85 …</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: We’ve got it. We’ve got it.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: 93% … 95%… 95%</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s all we need.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Come on, baby. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Full quantum cascade at 95%. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You’re sorry? You’re fucking sorry?</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: I don’t blame him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’ll go talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Leave him alone. He just needs to blow off
some steam.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m going to the lab.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Waste of time. Da Vinci never slept.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. I’m here if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Quiet. He worked in the lab till about 10:30
and then went to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ah, my two favorite people. Good
morning.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Why so cheery this morning?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You know some days you just wake up
feeling the world is full of potential. Like your eyes have been
opened.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I’m happy if I make it to my coffee
machine.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I restructured the third genome on your
radiated protein strand. Thought you might want to take look.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Cook up a batch and let’s see where we
go.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I thought you’d want to take a look at
it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I trust you. Now if you’ll excuse me, I
need to have my head examined.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m telling you, I know him. Something’s
going on.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Think he knows about us.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: If he knew about us, he’d be angry and that
wasn’t angry.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: When you were a kid, you ever
dream about being invisible?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Sure… all the time.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: What did you imagine you’d
do?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: The usual.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: What’s the usual?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Hanging out in the girl’s locker room.
Kicking Jimmy Margiani’s ass.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Jimmy Margiani?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: School asshole. Drove a red Trans Am. Back
then, I was the size of a small planet and made a rather large
target.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Ever think up anything along the
grand scale?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Sure. World domination. Manipulating stock
markets, consolidating a political power base. But those are more recent
fantasies.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: And what if it weren’t fantasy? What if
you were out there in the world and could do whatever you wanted with no
consequences whatsoever. How far would go? I mean… if it were real?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I don’t know, man. Out in the real world… I
mean, there’s a responsibility…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Let’s say you saw a woman with amazing
tits. Would you brush against them?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Hell, I try and do that now.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Human nature. So if you could get away
with more, would you do more?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: I read that in a survey at a major
university they asked college students “Would you steal if you were
guaranteed to get away with it?” 82% said yes.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Eighty two percent? Makes you wonder if
the world’s ready for what we’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: So, Doc what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: When you were out.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I just walked around. Y’know.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Aw, you just walked around? Come on. There’s
more, right?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Man, I’d be walking up to people saying shit
like “This is God, go,get a haircut.” Or hanging out in the changing
room at Victoria’s Secret.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Kind of sophomoric, don’t you think.
Besides, it was late and I wasn’t out that long.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Well, did you see anybody?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: There was this one girl.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Yeah? And did you mess with her?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Naw…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s fine. I just didn’t know you were there.
Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Thanks. No, just checking. ’Kay, bye.
Phew.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Relax… it’s nothing. Where were we?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Be quiet!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Shhhh. It’s Nobody-It’s
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You awake?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: I am now.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Notice anything unusual last night.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Franklin Three. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: What of?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: His neck was broken and his windpipe
collapsed.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: How’d that happen?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I thought maybe you could tell me.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Sarah… You saying I had something
to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He was alive last night when I left and he
was dead this morning. And you were the only one down here.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: I was in my room all night.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: That’s all twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He never left the room.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: A windpipe doesn’t just suddenly collapse.
Someone or something killed it.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: You saw the tape. The man was in his
chamber.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Then we have a problem, because I the cage
was locked from the outside. That means it was opened, the dog was
killed and the cage was closed and locked again. Only a human could do
that.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Well, it wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: And it wasn’t him.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Are we sure?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Any big plans for tonight?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Quiet night at home. Maybe a book.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Really? Whatever happened to that guy
your were seeing?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s still in the picture. Why?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Being locked down here, I’m forced to
live vicariously. Someday you’ll have to tell me what he’s like.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Maybe someday I will. See you in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Au domain.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Forgot something.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: What the hell?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Pretty clever really. All it does is recycle
the signal. He flips this switch, it takes a snapshot and that’s all we
see.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Asshole.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: And you think he’s violent?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He killed a dog with his bare hands.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Dogs aren’t people. Are we in any danger?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Either way, we aren’t equipped to handle
this. We have to inform the committee.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: What if he doesn’t come back?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: They’ll go after him. Who has tonight’s
shift?</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Pretend nothing’s wrong. Everyone just do
what you’re doing so he doesn’t become suspicious. Okay? Matt and I’ll
go tell Doctor Kramer and we’ll lot the committee deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: I’ll call General Caster right now and
convene the oversight committee tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What do we do in the meantime?</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Just sit tight and wait for my call.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kramer</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Just a little trouble at work.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kramer</strong>: You coming up?</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: In a minute. I have to make a few calls.</p>
<p><strong>kramer</strong>: Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: What? No good morning for me?
Don’t you like me anymore?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh, sorry. I…I’m in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: That’s okay. It’s going to be
busy day.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: When did he say held call?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He’s probably meeting with the committee
trying to figure out what to do.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m gonna call him.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s dead. Drowned in his pool last
night.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Let me see that.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’ll be right back with help.</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: Authorization please.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: Authorization invalid. Request denied.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s a first.</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: Authorization please.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Foster One Delta Eight Three Five.</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: Authorization invalid. Request denied.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Let me try mine.</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: Authorization please.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Kensington Two Romeo One Five Nine.</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: Authorization invalid. Request denied.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Tell me this isn’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We’ve got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: How long before anybody starts looking for
us?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There’s no set check in procedure. It could
be weeks.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Already in. It was only a second level
encryption.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Some security system.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh the system is fine. It’s just I’m just
extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with the system. Our
codes have been removed.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Removed? By who?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Here’s a clue. Only one code remains.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Whose?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Dr. Sebastian Caine.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: He’s not in there.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Okay, Sebastian. Fun’s over. Tell us where
you are.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: I’m sorry. But I can’t lot you
turn me in.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian… where are you?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: You have no idea what it’s like.
The power of it. The freedom. I can’t let that go.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: C’mon Sebastian. You’re scaring me. Tell me
where you are and we can talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: There’s nothing to talk about.
See … I’ve done things that can’t be undone.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian! Sebastian! I want search parties.
Thermal goggles and tranquilizers.</p>
<p><strong>janice</strong>: Dr. Caine? Are you in here? Dr. Caine?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Doctor Caine?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: This is bad.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There’s something over there.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: She was strangled. Multiple blows to her
head.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Intercom… the phone lines. They’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Gimme that.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What the fuck is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Did you find him?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Janice is dead.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: It’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The man has checked out of reality.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What happened? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Isn’t it obvious? Right now, we’re the only
ones who knows he exists. If he gets rid of us, no one knows and he
becomes the most powerful man on earth.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But he’s not a killer.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He wasn’t. He is now.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Can you fix the elevator? Restore our
codes?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’d take hours to crack the encryptions.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Right now that sounds like good news.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: So what do we do until then. Sit around
waiting for him to kill us off?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No. We find him, before he finds us.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: You sure this’ll work.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We designed it to help find the rats we kept
dropping in year one. They were too small for thermal scans.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Systems hot. Activating motion detectors.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’ve got movement in Corridor Six.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: That’s him.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Got ’em.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Check. Check.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Just watch our backs. Hey Carter, ready?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Take a right at the next accessway. He’s
working his way back to the offices.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: If we split up, can we trap him on corridor
eight?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: If he keeps heading in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Going Thermal.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I lost him. Matt, I lost him.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He probably just stopped moving.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Do you have anything?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: How did he get by us?</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: He couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sebastian! We’re here to help. Sebastian.</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: There. Behind those pipes. He’s not
moving.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We see him. But he’s not responding. The heat
signature doesn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: C’mon… C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: Covered.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What the…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He was there.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Looks like… looks like we’re pumping out
heat…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I got movement again! He’s right on top of
you!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No fucking shit!</p>
<p><strong>carter</strong>: H…Help… MMmmphg</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Where is he? Where the fuck is he?!?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Right on top of you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: What’s going on? Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Carter’s down. Hurt bad. Bleeding from a head
wound.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Matt, he’s coming toward you.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Got outta there.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s close!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Goddamnit. The doors are closing. He’s
shutting me in.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s coming right at you!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Twenty, maybe thirty feet.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Goddamnit, I got thermals all over the place.
Eight, maybe ten of them. Must be ghosts.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Those signatures … they’re coming from the
heating vents.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I’m starting to lose resolution on my
thermals.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Get out of there!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If the room temperature is the same as his
body temperature, thermal visors’ll be no good.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I’m going!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Linda…it’s not safe.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: That’s why I’m going. Corridor eight is
clear. Get Carter to the lab. We’ll meet you there.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Marco…Polo… Marco… Polo…</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: So… just out of curiosity, how long has
my best friend been fucking my ex- girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sebastian. Get a hold of yourself. You aren’t
thinking rationally.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: She’s a pretty sweet fuck, isn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Calm down, Sebastian… we can talk this
through. It’s not too late.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: C’mon Sebastian. Don’t do this. I’m your
friend.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: I’m sorry, but I just feel that
our friendship is holding me back. I’m sure you understand.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s pretty severe. We have to get him to the
lab.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s got to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: For godsakes, help me.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He was going to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I know. He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: We’ve got to got out of here.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Habitats.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Oh god. That’s right between us and the
lab.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: His pulse is faint.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: This’ll hold him but he needs blood.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Supply is right down the hall. I’ll be two
seconds.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sarah, wait for the others</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: If I wait, he’ll die. Keep pressure on the
wound.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Ahh! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s let the animals out. It wasn’t him we
were tracking.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It won’t kill me unless it gets infected.
You?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Me …. Don’t ask about me. If he freed all the
animals, we could have dozens running around the lab.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: So he could be anywhere right now.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Get to the lab, lock the goddamn doors and
pray to God Frank can reprogram the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Frank?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: You missed.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Please no. Let me go. Oh god, let me go.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: I’ve always liked your
feistiness.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sarah! Sarah! Goddamnit. Stay with me now.
Don’t you let up… Sarah! Sarah!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She went to the supply room. Carter needed
blood.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I said no one goes anywhere alone.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: She didn’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh god. Sarah!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Her too?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This didn’t happen. This hasn’t happened.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It happened alright. Now we have to deal with
it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah? And just what are we supposed to do
now?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Now? Now you die.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s here!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: I don’t know if you can understand this, but
what you’re experiencing is a psychological breakdown. This isn’t who
you are.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: I would say that what I am
experiencing is psychological awareness. I like you being in complete
and absolute control.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You goddamn bastard! You goddamn bastard.
You’re gonna pay for this. I’m going to bring you back to visibility and
then I’m going throw your ass in jail.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: You’re never gonna bring me back
Linda. I never want to come back.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Or maybe I’ll fuck you. One last
time for old times sake.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Don’t listen to him. It’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Come on, Matt. Let’s go get the elevator back
on-line so we can got out of this hell hole.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He does anything, anything at all, come get
us. I’ll be back to check on you in five.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Imagine you two, carrying on
right under my nose. Out of curiosity, what did he give you that I
couldn’t?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Shut up, Sebastian. He’s more of a man than
you’ll ever be.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Okay, sweetie. I’ll be quiet. If
that’s what you want…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian? Sebastian? No.. No…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: Figured it out? You were always
so clever.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You won’t get away with this. They’ll find
out about you. They’ll hunt you down.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: The villagers with their torches?
Lock up your daughters! Sorry, Lin. It’s not gonna happen that way.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: How can you be so brutal?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian’s voice</strong>: I guess because I don’t have to
look at myself in the mirror anymore Remember that first night I was
out? I did something bad, just to see if I could get away with it. And
when I did, I realized I could have it all. I can kill in broad
daylight. And nobody’s gonna tell the police they were fucked by a
ghost. Anything I desire I can make happen, but not if people know.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I’m dizzy. I can’t feel my legs.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Just keep going. I’ll fix you later.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Matt… Matthew. Stay with me now.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He surprised us. We weren’t expecting…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Shhh. Don’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Lin…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You feel that?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: A little…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Your losing blood, but he didn’t hit the
vitals.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: This is temporary.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Barely.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Just keeps getting worse.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: There’s no way out.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: There’s got to be.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: They say freezing to death isn’t so bad. You
just kinda pass out.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Matt! MATT!</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: Authorization please?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Caine. One One One One One.</p>
<p><strong>elevator</strong>: Authorization valid. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Sebastian!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You said it yourself, Lin. I shouldn’t
hold on to the past.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Aaaaaaahhhh!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: You wanna see God? I’ll show you God.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I’m gonna find everyone in your family
and kill them-. Your sister… she never liked me. I think I’ll go after
her and her little boy first.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Thought I’d… thought I’d save you for a
change.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Nitro…</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: He said it himself… All they’ll find is a pile
of charred corpses.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: He’s rigged the centrifuge.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: In an enclosed space, he’ll wipe out the whole
lab.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Grab on.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Forget about me. You go.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Fuck you. Give me your hands.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Climb!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Climb!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I can’t. I’m going to pass out.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Oh God!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Don’t look.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Move!</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’s coming down!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: C’mon. Before it slips.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Sebastian, you fuck.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Get off me.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Let go of me.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Remember the day we met? You were wearing
a red dress and you were so pretty. Now… Now look at you.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: Get off of her!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: You fucked it all up.</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>marine guard</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>linda</strong>: We lived.</p>
