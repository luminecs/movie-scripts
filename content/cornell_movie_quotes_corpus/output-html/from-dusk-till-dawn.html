<h1 id="from-dusk-till-dawn">from-dusk-till-dawn</h1>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: A light switch is flipped on.</p>
<p><strong>mcgraw</strong>: Hot goddamn day!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Haven’t felt it a bit. Been inside with the
air conditioner blastin’ all day long.</p>
<p><strong>mcgraw</strong>: Not even for lunch?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’m by myself today, ate my lunch outta the
microwave.</p>
<p><strong>mcgraw</strong>: Jesus Christ man, that microwave food will
kill ya as quick as a bullet. Those burritos are only fit for a hippie
high on weed. Pull me down a bottle of Jack Daniels. I’m gettin’ tanked
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Whatsamatter?</p>
<p><strong>mcgraw</strong>: Awww, it’s just been a shitass day. Every
inch of it hot and miserable. First off, Nadine at the Blue Chip got
some sorta sick, so that Mongoloid boy of hers was workin’ the grill.
That fuckin’ idiot don’t know rat shit from Rice Krispies. I ate
breakfast at nine, was pukin’ up pigs in a blanket like a sick dog by
ten thirty.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Isn’t there a law or something against retards
serving food to the public?</p>
<p><strong>mcgraw</strong>: Well, if there ain’t there sure oughta be.
Who knows what goes on inside Mongoloid’s mind?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You could sue the shit out of her, ya know.
That kid belongs under a circus tent, not flippin’ burgers. You could
own that fuckin’ place.</p>
<p><strong>mcgraw</strong>: What the hell would I do with that grease
pit? Besides, Nadine’s got enough of a cross to bear just taking care of
that potato head. Then all this Abilene shit happened. You heard about
that bank robbery in Abilene, didn’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: That’s all that’s been on the box all day.
They killed some people didn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>mcgraw</strong>: Four Rangers, three cops, and two civilians.
And they took a lady bank teller as a hostage.</p>
<p><strong>mcgraw</strong>: They’ll probably make a run for the border,
which would bring ’em this way. And if we get our hands on those shit
asses, we’re talking payback time. We’ll get ’em all right. I gotta
piss. I’m gonna use your commode.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Knock yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>black suited man #1</strong>: Do you think I’m fuckin’
playing with you, asshole? Do you want this little girl to die? Or that
little girl? Or your bosombuddy with the badge? Or yourself? I don’t
wanna do it, but I’ll turn this fuckin’ store into the Wild Bunch if I
even think you’re fuckin’ with me.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What do you want from me? I did what you
said.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Letting him use your toilet? No store does
that.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: He comes in here every day and we bullshit.
He’s used my toilet a thousand times. If I told him no, he’d know
something was up.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I want that son-of-a-bitch out outta here, in
his car, and down the road or you can change the name of this place to
“Benny’s World of Blood.”</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Were you giving that pig signals?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What? Are you kidding? I didn’t do
anything!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: He says you were scratching.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I wasn’t scratching!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You callin’ him a liar?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I’m not calling him a liar, okay? I’m simply
saying that if I was scratching, and if I did scratch, it’s not because
I was signaling the cop, it’s because I’m fuckin’ scared shitless.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: The Ranger’s taking a piss. Why don’t I
just go in there, blow his head off and get outta here.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Don’t do that! Look, you asked me to act
natural, and I’m acting as natural – in fact, under the circumstances, I
think I ought get a fuckin’ Academy Award for how natural I’m acting.
You asked me to get rid of him, I’m doing my best.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, well, your best better get a helluva lot
fuckin’ better, or you’re gonna feel a helluva fuckin’ lot worse.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Everybody be cool.</p>
<p><strong>mcgraw</strong>: Yeah, and I’m gonna be right back at it
tomorrow. So tonight I’m gonna sit in front of the box and just drink
booze. How much is the bottle?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Six-fifty.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What the fuck was that about?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: He signaled the Ranger.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I didn’t. You gotta believe me, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: When they were talkin’, he mouthed the
words “Help Us.”</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: You fuckin’ liar, I didn’t say shit!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What the fuck is wrong with you –</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Seth, he did it. You were by the beer
cooler with your back turned. I was by the magazines, I could see his
face. And I saw him mouth:</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Start the car.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You believe me don’t cha?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Shut up and start the car.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Richie? You okay?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m not dead, but I’m definitely shot! I
told you that bastard said, “Help us!”</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I never said help us!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well that don’t matter now, ‘cause you got
about two fuckin’ seconds to live! Richie!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: When I count three, shoot out the bottles
behind him!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Gotcha!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: One… Two… Three.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What did I tell you? What did I tell you? Buy
the road map and leave.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What am I supposed to do, Seth? He
recognized us.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: He didn’t recognize shit.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Seth, I’m telling you, the way he looked at
us – you especially – I knew he knew.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Low profile. Do you know what the words “low
profile” mean?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: We got about two more hours of day light
left. That’ll get us into El Paso, which is right next to the border.
We’ll stop at a motel –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Stop? We’re not going to actually stop at a
motel, are we?</p>
<p><strong>scott and kate</strong>: We’ve got a Winnebago. We don’t need
those over priced roach havens. We’re self contained.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Okay, Okay, maybe I was a little overzealous,
but give me a break, I just bought it.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Why, just look at all this. You got your
kitchen –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: – you got your microwave –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: – you got your sink –</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: – you got your shower –</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: – see this, television!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Feel this, real wood paneling. That’s real
wood, too, not that fake stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Unless you two wiseacres wanna be introduced
to the joys of hitchhiking, what say we drop this?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: The truth hurts.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s the bitterest of pills.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You two ought to start a stand-up act,
because you’re just wasting your humor on me.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Ain’t it the truth.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Why do you want to stop?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Lie in the back, Dad, I’ll drive us into
Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I just bet you would. Don’t even thin about
it. Besides, I want to have one night’s sleep in an honest-to-goodness
bed. The beds in the home are okay, but they’re not like a real bed.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Hey, if we go to a motel, we can swim.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I’ll be right back. I’m gonna go to the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Dad, when I called the machine to check our
messages there was one from Bethel Baptist. Mr.Franklin said he wouldn’t
permanently replace you until we came back. He said when we come home,
if you still feel the same way –</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: That’s very nice of Ted, but I’ll call him
tomorrow and tell him not to bother waiting.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I didn’t want to talk about this in front of
Scott because he gets upset. But you don’t believe in God anymore?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Not enough to be a pastor. Look, I know this
is hard on you kids. After Jenny’s death, this is probably the last
thing you need. But I can’t do it any longer. My congregation needs
spiritual leadership. Well, they can’t get that from me anymore. My
faith is gone. To answer your question, yes, I do believe in Jesus. But
do I love them? No. After Jenny died, I just thought, what’s the
point?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s just, all our lives you’ve been a pastor.
For twenty years you’ve preached trust in the lord. And then one day you
wake up and say fuck him?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I didn’t say fuck him. I’m just not connected
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: That happens, you’ll get it back.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Kate, give your old man a little credit.
Every person who chooses the service of God as their life’s work has
something in common. I don’t care if you’re a preacher, a priest, a nun,
a rabbi or a Buddhist monk. Many, many times during your life you’ll
look at your reflection in the mirror and ask yourself, am I a fool?
We’ve all done it. I’m not going through a lapse. What I’ve experienced
is closer to awakening. I’m not trying to shake your faith. I’ve just
decided not to devote my life to God anymore.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What do you think Mom would say?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Mom’s got nothing to say, she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: COUNTER BELL. A hand slams down on it.
RING.</p>
<p><strong>texas voice</strong>: Hold your horses!</p>
<p><strong>old-timer</strong>: Whatcha want?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Whatcha think I want, ya mean old bastard? I
wanna room.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Do they have cable?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Do they have an X-rated channel?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Do they have a waterbed?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: They don’t have anything except four walls and
a roof, and that’s all we need.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Open the door. We gotta do this fast.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: KEY going into the trunk lock,
turning.</p>
<p><strong>trunk pov</strong>: Seth looking into the camera.</p>
<p><strong>seth’s pov</strong>: A WOMAN in her late forties is lying
scrunched up in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Don’t say a word.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You. Plant yourself in that chair.</p>
<p><strong>hostage</strong>: What are you planning on doing with –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – I said plant yourself. Plants don’t talk.
You wanna get on my good side? Just sit still and don’t make a peep.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: How’s it feel?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: How ya think, it hurts like a
son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I got both rooms on either side of us, so we
don’t gotta worry about eavesdropping assholes. How’s that feel? You
okay?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Feels good.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m gonna go get the money.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It’s about five o’clock. What time does it get
dark around here?</p>
<p><strong>hostage</strong>: About seven.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Good. I’m going towards the border to check
things out while it’s still daylight. Call Carlos and arrange the
rendezvous.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hey, when you talk to him, see if you can
arrange a better deal than thirty percent.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s their standard deal, brother. They
ain’t about to change it for us.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Did you even to try to negotiate?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: These guys ain’t spic fire cracker salesman
from Tijuana. They don’t even know the meaning of the word “barter”. You
wanna stay in El Ray? You give them thirty percent of your loot. It’s
scripture. So it is written, so shall it be done. You want sanctuary,
you pay the price, and the price is thirty percent.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: All I’m saying –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: – This conversation is over.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Now, we need to have a talk. What’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>hostage</strong>: Gloria.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hello, Gloria, I’m Seth and that’s my brother
Richie. Let’s cut to the chase. I’m gonna ask you a question and all I
want is a yes or no answer. Do you want to live through this?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Good. Then let me explain the house rules.
Follow the rules, we’ll get along like a house on fire. Rule number one:
No noise, no question. You make a noise… …Mr. 45 makes a noise. You ask
a question, Mr. 45 answers it. Now are you absolutely, positively clear
about rule number one?</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Rule number two: You do what we say, when we
say it. If you don’t, see rule number one.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Rule number three: Don’t you ever try and
fuckin’ run on us. ’Cause I got five little friends, and they all run
faster ’n you can. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Open your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Gloria, you hang in there, follow the rules,
and don’t fuck with us, you’ll get out of this alive. I give you my
word. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’ll be back in a bit.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Wanna come up here on the bed and watch TV
with me?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Things are real hot here. Crossing’s gonna be
a bitch. Don’t worry, we’ll get across. But when we do, where do we go?
Can we make it as close to the border as possible? Texas wants our
balls. The quicker we’re in your protection, the better I’ll feel. Okay,
where? The Titty Twister? I love it already. Okay, Carlos, I’ll see you
and your men at the “Titty Twister” tomorrow morning. Bye, my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: This bloody crime spree started just a
week ago today. The oldest of the two brothers…</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: …Seth Gecko was serving time in
Rolling’s Kansas State Penitentiary for his part in the 1988 Scott City
bank robbery in which two law enforcement officers lost their lives.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: Having served eight years of his
twenty-two year sentence, Seth Gecko was brought to Wichita Municipal
court house for his first parole hearing. It was while at the court
house that this man…</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: … his younger brother Richard Gecko, a
known armed robber and sex offender, pulled off a daring daylight
escape…</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: …resulting in the death of four Wichita
law enforcement officers, and this woman…</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: …Heide Vogel, sixth grade teacher who
was run over by the Geckos during a high speed pursuit through downtown
Wichita.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: From there the brothers traveled from
Kansas through Oklahoma…</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: …into the great state of Texas, and
then finally…</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: …into Abilene.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: The list of the dead climbed up three
more notches since our last telecast.</p>
<p><strong>photo</strong>: OFFICER SHERMAN GOODELL in full police
uniform.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: Officer Sherman Goodell, who was in
intensive care following the gun battle outside of the Valley Federal
bank building…</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: …died about forty-five minutes ago at
Hopkins General hospital. And about six hours ago, during a daylight
liquor store robbery in Big Springs, The Gecko Brothers killed another
Texas Ranger…</p>
<p><strong>photo</strong>: EARL MCGRAW in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: …Earl McGraw…</p>
<p><strong>photo</strong>: PETE in a Hawaiian shirt holding up a big
fish.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: …and liquor store clerk Pet
Bottoms.</p>
<p><strong>video footage</strong>: Of Benny’s World of Liquor burning
down.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: Then they proceeded to burn the store
down to the ground.</p>
<p><strong>video graphic</strong>: Picture of The Gecko Brothers with a
tally underneath:</p>
<p><strong>death toll</strong>: 13</p>
<p><strong>texas rangers - police officers - civilians</strong>: 4 7
2</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: That changes the death toll to fifteen.
Five Texas Rangers… Eight police officers Three civilians.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: And one hostage…</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: … bank teller and mother of four,
Gloria Hill.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: Heading the case to bring these
fugitives to justice is FBI agent Stanley Chase. We talked with agent
Chase earlier this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>stanley chase</strong>: For the time being we are very
confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty-eight hours.
The Bureau, local law enforcement and the Texas Rangers have all joined
forces in forming a dragnet to snare Seth and Richard Gecko.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: Agent Chase, does it appear that they
are heading for Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>stanley chase</strong>: Yes, it does, Kelly. We have already
alerted the Mexican authorities. They intend to cooperate every way
possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: Are you optimistic about the safety of
the hostage they took in Abilene, Gloria Hill?</p>
<p><strong>stanley chase</strong>: We’ve received no news one way or the
other. We can only hope for the best.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: What about the report from an
eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was
shot?</p>
<p><strong>stanley chase</strong>: This can’t be confirmed at this time,
but we do believe it to be true. We have reason to believe it was the
youngest brother Richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck
and shoulders by the store’s clerk.</p>
<p><strong>kelly houge</strong>: Is it safe to assume that because the
death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers,
that the Bureau, the Rangers and the police force are taking this
manhunt personally?</p>
<p><strong>stanley chase</strong>: I would say that’s a very safe
assumption.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Is it safe to assume since the law
enforcement authorities in the great state of Texas are homosexuals of a
sick and deviate nature, that they will be too busy fucking each other
up the ass to actually catch The Gecko Brothers? I would say that’s a
very safe assumption.</p>
<p><strong>casper</strong>: Would you play with me?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Sure, little boy… A GHOST!!!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Shit, I started to get worried. Where the
fuck ya been?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Sight seein’.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What’d ya see?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Cops.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Didya look at the border?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, I saw the border. Through binoculars
from on top of a high building. That’s about as close as I risked
getting. What’s the TV say?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: They’re going to apprehend us in
forty-eight hours.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I gotta figure a way to get across that
goddamn border. Longer we fuck around El Paso our lives ain’t worth a
shit.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Look, fuck the border. Let’s just dig in
and wait for things to cool down.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Richie, it’s gonna get a lot fuckin’ worse
before it gets any fuckin’ better. We showed our ass in Texas. We killed
Texas fuckin’ Rangers. They ain’t gonna stop lookin’ till they find us,
and when they find us, they’re gonna kill us. Texans take it very
personal when ya kill their law enforcement officers. The El Paso police
have already started a motel and hotel search for us.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I heard it on the radio. We gotta get our
asses into Mexico tonight. Carlos is gonna meet us tomorrow morning at a
rendezvous on the other side, then Carlos and his boys will escort us to
El Ray and –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Where’s the woman?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What’d ya mean, what? The fuckin’ woman, the
hostage. Where the fuck is she, Richard!?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: She’s in the other room.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What the fuck is she doin’ there?!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Seth, before you open the door, let me
explain what happened.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Oh, Richard, what’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Now, Seth, before you flip out, let me just
explain what happened.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, explain it to me. I need an explanation.
What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with me, brother.
That woman tried to escape and I did what I had to do.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No. That woman wouldn’t of said shit if she
had a mouthful.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong,
wrong! Once you left, she became a whole different person.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Is it me? Is it my fault?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It’s not your fault, it’s her fault!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Is this my fault? Do you think this is what I
am?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: This is not me! I am a professional fucking
thief. I steal money. You try to stop me, god help you. But I don’t kill
people I don’t have to, and I don’t rape women. What you doin’ ain’t how
it’s done. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Seth, if you were me –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Just say yes! Nothing else, just say yes.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yes, Seth, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes, Seth, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We get into Mexico, it’s gonna be sweet
Rosemary, hundred-proof liquor, and rice and beans. None of this shit’s
gonna matter.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I can’t believe he’s stopping here. This place
looks totally cruddy.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Dad, why are we stopping here?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: There’s nothing wrong with this place.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s a flop house.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s not a flop house. It’s basic and simple.
That doesn’t make it a flop house.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: If it doesn’t have a pool, we’re looking for a
new place.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It has a bed. That’s all I care about.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Other places have beds, they also have cable
TV, a gym, room service…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Owww, my head.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Watch where you’re going!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: What’s this guy’s problem?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I have no idea.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Anytime, man.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Creepy guy.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m your neighbor in room 9, I hate to
disturb you, but I’d like to ask a favor.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I hope none of this is disturbing you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hi there, I’m from room 9, my name is Don
Cornelius. No, not the Don Cornelius from Soul Train. Me and my lady
friend need some ice and we don’t seem to have an ice bucket. Could we
possibly borrow yours? I’ll bring it right back.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It’s called a punch.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Good boy.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Okay, Jacob, get up and sit your ass down on
the bed. Make a wrong move and I’ll shoot you in the face.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Okay, move the Jap over there.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Upsy daisy.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What’s the story with you two? You a couple of
fags?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: He’s my son.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: How does that happen? You don’t look
Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Neither does he. He looks Vietnamese.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Oh, well, excuse me all to hell.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s this about, money?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It’s about money, all right, but not yours.
You see, me and my brother here are in a little hot water and we need
your assistance.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We’re having a wet bikini contest, and you
just won.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s okay, honey. Everything’s going to be
all right.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Just listen to daddy, sugar, and don’t do
nothin’ stupid. You two, Simon says sit the fuck down!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Where are the keys to the motor home?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: On the dresser.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Richie, take the keys. Start that big bastard
up, and drive it up front.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Richie, will you do me a favor and eat my
pussy?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Richard!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Not when you get around to it, now.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You, Gidget, go in the bathroom and put on
some clothes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You got three minutes. One second longer, I
shoot your father in the face. Do you understand what I just said?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Do you believe me?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You damn well better. Go.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Look, if you want the motor home, just take
it and get out.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Sorry, Pops, it ain’t gonna be that easy.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Get ready to move out, we’re all going on a
little ride.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Not a chance.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Come again?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: If you’re taking people, take me. But my kids
aren’t going anywhere with you.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Sorry, I need everybody.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: My children are not going with you, and
that’s that.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s not fuckin’ that… this is fuckin’ this.
Go sit over there.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I ain’t got time to fuck around with you, so
I’ll make this simple. Take your kids and get in the car, or I’ll
execute all three of you right now. What’s it gonna be, yes or no
answer?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Good. Your old man’s all right, he just saved
your life.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Times up, Princess.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Okay, ramblers, let’s get to rambling.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Where are you taking us?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What’s in Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Mexicans.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Jacob Fuller. Jacob, that’s biblical, ain’t
it? What am I askin’ for, of course it is. What are their names?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Scott and Kate.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Scott and Kate… Kate and Scott… Scott Fuller…
Kate Fuller…</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: My wife.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Where is the little lady?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: In heaven.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: She’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yes, she is.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: How’d she die?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Auto wreck.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Come on, gimme some more details. How’d it
happen? Some fuckin’ drunk kill her?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No. It was a rainy night, the brakes on the
car weren’t great. She had to stop suddenly. She slid on the road, she
crashed, she died.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Died instantly?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Not quite. She was trapped in the wreck for
about six hours before she passed on.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Whewww! Those acts of God really stick it in
and break it off, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yes, they do.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Is this real?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’ve seen one of these before. A friend of
mine had himself declared a minister of his own religion. Away to fuck
the IRS. Is that what you’re doing, or are you the real McCoy?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Real McCoy.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You’re a preacher?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I was a minister.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Was? As in not anymore?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why’d ya quit?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I think I’ve gotten about as up close and
personal with you as I’m gonna get. Now if you need me like I think you
need me, you’re not gonna kill me ’cause I won’t answer your stupid,
prying questions. So, with all due respect, mind your own business.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I seem to have touched a nerve. Don’t be so
sensitive, Pops, let’s keep this friendly. But you’re right, enough with
the getting to know you shit. Now, there’s two ways we can play this
hand. One way is me and you go round an’ round all fuckin’ night. The
other way, is we reach some sort of an understanding. Now, if we go down
that first path at the end of the day, I’ll win. But we go down the
second, we’ll both win. Now, I don’t give a rat’s ass about you or your
fuckin’ family. Y’all can live forever or die this second and I don’t
care which. The only things I do care about are me that son-of-a-bitch
in the back, and our money. And right now I need to get those three
things into Mexico. Now, stop me if I’m wrong, but I take it you don’t
give a shit about seeing me and my brother receiving justice, or the
bank getting its money back. Right now all you care about is the safety
of your daughter, your son and possibly yourself. Am I correct?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I thought so. You help us get across the
border without incident, stay with us the rest of the night without
trying anything funny, and in the morning we’ll let you and your family
go. That way everybody gets what they want. You and your kids get out of
this alive and we get into Mexico. Everybody’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: How do I know you’ll keep your word?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Jesus Christ, Pops, don’t start with this
shit.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You want me to sit here and be passive. The
only way being passive in this situation makes sense is if I believe
you’ll let us go. I’m not there yet. You have to convince me you’re
telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Look, dickhead, the only thing you need to be
convinced about is that you’re stuck in a situation with a coupla real
mean motor scooters. I don’t wanna hafta worry about you all fuckin’
night. And I don’t think you wanna be worrying about my brother’s
intentions toward your daughter all night. You notice the way he looked
at her, didn’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Didn’t like it, did ya?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Didn’t think so. So, as I was saying, I’m
willing to make a deal. You behave, get us into Mexico, and don’t try to
escape. I’ll keep my brother off your daughter and let you all loose in
the morning.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You won’t let him touch her?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I can handle Richie, don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I give you my word.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: My words, my law. Better you not take it, and
that’s just where we are, then take it and not mean it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: If he touches her, I’ll kill him. I don’t
give a fuck how many guns you have, nothing will stop me from killing
him.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Fair enough. You break your word, I’ll kill
all of you. Kate, honey!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You must have a bible in here, don’t cha?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Yeah, we got a bible.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Get it and bring it up here, will ya,
please?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hold it right there, sweetie pie. Put your
hand on it.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Swear to God, on the Bible, you won’t try to
escape and you’ll get us across the border.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I swear to God I won’t try to escape and I’ll
do my best to get you into Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You best better get it done, Pops.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I swear to God I’ll let you loose in the
morning. And your daughter will be safe. And I also swear if you do
anything to fuck me up, I’ll slit all your throats.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Did ya mean what you said back there?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: In the room. Were you serious, or were you
just foolin’ around? I’m just bringing it up, ’cause if you really want
me to do that for you, I will.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What you said to me in the room.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You asked me if I would –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Richard!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I told you to watch those kids, I didn’t say
talk to ‘em. You guys ain’t got nothin’ to say to one another. So cut
the chatter.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We’ll talk later.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Okay everybody, it’s show time. Richie, take
Kate in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Scott, you come up front with your daddy.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m telling you, don’t hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: As long as you’re cool, she’ll be cool.
What’re ya gonna say?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I don’t have the slightest idea.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well, you just keep thinkin’ of that gun next
to Kate’s temple.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m gonna try and get us across the
border.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: No, dad, you gotta tell ’em that they’re back
there.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: This isn’t gonna work.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Shut up. It’s gonna work just fine,</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I just want to go on record as saying this
is a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Duly noted. Now, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: They’re gonna search the van.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: As long as you don’t act like a fuckin’ nut,
we’ll be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You just called me a fuckin’ nut.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yes, you did. You said as long as I don’t
act like a fuckin’ nut, implying that I’ve been acting like a fuckin’
nut.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Take a pill, kid. I just meant stay cool.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You meant that, but you meant the other,
too.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: This ain’t the time, Richard.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Fuck those spic pigs! You called me a
fuckin’ nut, and where I come from, that stops the train on its
tracks.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Or what?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Have you forgotten about your sister?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: They’re gonna kill us. They get us across the
border, they’re gonna take us out in the desert and shoot us.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: If they get over the border, they’re gonna
let us go.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Dad, I watch those reality shows. They never
let anybody go. Any cop will tell you, in a situation like this, you get
a chance, you go for it. This is our chance.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What about Kate?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: They’re gonna kill her anyway. At least now
with all these cops we’ve got a fighting chance.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Son, I have this situation under control. I
know exactly what I’m doing. You’re going to have to trust me on
this.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: If trusting you means trusting those fuckin’
killers, I can’t do that. If you don’t tell the cops, I will.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Now, you listen to me. You ain’t gonna do a
goddamn fucking thing, you hear me! Nobody cares what you think, I’m
running this show, I make the decisions.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: He’s running the show.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m running the show. I make the plays, and
you back the plays I make. Stop thinking with your fucking balls. Kate
in a room with a couple of desperate men with nothing to fucking lose
ain’t the time to “go for it.” I need your cover. Cover my ass.</p>
<p><strong>border guard</strong>: How many with you?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Just my son and I.</p>
<p><strong>border guard</strong>: What is your purpose in Mexico?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Vacation. I’m taking him to see his first
bullfight.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m curious. What was the nuttiest thing I
did?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: This ain’t the time.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, I know, was it possibly when your ass
was rotting in jail and I broke it out? Yeah, you’re right, that was
pretty fuckin’ nutty. Not to mention stupid. But you know what? I can
fix that right now.</p>
<p><strong>border guard</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh, that’s just my daughter in the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>border guard</strong>: You said it was just you and your
son.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I meant me, my son and my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>border guard</strong>: Open the door. I’m coming aboard.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>border guard</strong>: It’s the Border Patrol. Open up.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: It’s open.</p>
<p><strong>he sees</strong>: Kate by herself, pants around her ankles,
sitting on the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Do you mind? Shut the fucking door.</p>
<p><strong>border guard</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: It’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Goddamn, that was. intense!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We did it. We’re in Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Come here, Kate!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You were magnificent! You told him to shut the
fucking door. I’m hiding in the shower, and I’m thinking to myself, “Did
I just fuckin’ hear what I just fuckin’ heard? And what does he do – he
shuts the fucking door!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: If I was a bit younger, baby, I’d fuckin’
marry you!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I gotta hand it to ya, Pops, you raised a
fuckin’ woman.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: We did our part, we gotcha in Mexico. Now
it’s time for your part, letting us go.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Pops, when you’re right, you’re right, and you
are right.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re gonna let us go?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: In the morning, darlin’, in the morning, we
are G-O-N-E and you are F-R-E-E. Now, I know I put you guys through
hell, and I know I’ve been one rough pecker, but from here on end you
guys are in my cool book. Scotty, help me pick Richie up, and lay him
down. Jacob, keep going on this road till you get to a sign that says,
“Digayo.” When you get to Digayo, turn this big bastard left, go on down
for a few miles, then you see a bar called “The Titty Twister.” From
what I hear, you can’t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Then?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Then stop, ’cause that’s where we’re
going.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: C’mon, kid, wake up. Don’t make a career out
of it.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, I think so. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I don’t know, you just passed out.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I did?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, we were just standing there. You said
something about your shoulder hurting, then you just hit the ground like
a sack of potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, when you fell your head smacked the
toilet hard. It scared the shit outta me. Sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, I guess. I’m just a little fucked
up.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well, let me tell ya something, gonna clear
your head right up. We are officially Mexicans.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We are… “South of the border down Mexico
way.”</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: We are?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yep. We’re heading for the rendezvous right
now. We get there, we pound booze till Carlos shows up, he escorts us to
El Ray. And then me and you, brother, kick fuckin’ back. How ya like
them apples?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Far out. Where are my glasses?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: They broke when you fell.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Oh, fuck, Seth, that’s my only pair!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Don’t worry about it, we’ll get you some
glasses.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: What dya mean, don’t worry about it. Of
course I’m gonna worry about it, I can’t fuckin’ see.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: When we get to El Ray, I’ll take care of
it.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, like a Mexican hole-in-the-wall’s
gonna have my fuckin’ prescription.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It’s not a big deal, unless you make it a big
deal. Now, I’m real happy, Richie, stop bringing me down with
bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Guys! We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>the titty twister</strong>: Hiker/Trucker bar, Dusk till
Dawn</p>
<p><strong>ext. the titty twister night</strong>: The neon sign sits on
top of the rudest, sleaziest, most crab-infested, strip joint,
honky-tonk whorehouse in all of Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>the death, featuring the lovely santanico
pandemonium”,</strong>: “ATHENA AND DANNY THE WONDER PONY”, and “THE
SLEAZY TITTY</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Pussy, pussy, pussy! All pussy must go. At the
Titty Twister we’re slashing pussy in half! This is a pussy blow out!
Make us an offer on our vast selection of pussy! We got white pussy,
black pussy, Spanish pussy, yellow pussy, hot pussy, cold pussy, wet
pussy, tight pussy, big pussy, bloody pussy, fat pussy, hairy pussy,
smelly pussy, velvet pussy, silk pussy, Naugahyde pussy, snappin’ pussy,
horse pussy, dog pussy, mule pussy, fake pussy! If we don’t have it, you
don’t want it!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Okay, troops, this is the homestretch. Here’s
the deal; this place closes at dawn. Carlos is gonna meet us here
sometime before dawn. Which by my guesstimate is somewhere between three
or four hours from now. So we’re gonna go in there, take a seat, have a
drink – have a bunch of drinks, and wait for Carlos. That could be an
hour, that could be three hours, I don’t know which. But when he gets
here, me and Richie are going to leave with him. After we split, you
guys are officially out of this stewpot. Let me just say I’m real happy
about where we’re at. We got a real nice, “I don’t fuck with you – you
don’t fuck with me” attitude going on. Now, if everybody just keeps
playin’ it cool – and I’m talking to you, too, Richie – everybody’s
gonna get what they want. Comprende, amigos?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Okay hard drinkers, let’s drink hard. I’m
buyin’.</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot - night</strong>: The camper door FLIES OPEN
and the two brothers and the Fuller family step out into the night.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Out of the stew pot and into the fire.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Shit, I been to bars make this place look like
a fuckin’ 4-H club.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I gotta say I’m with Jacob on this. I been
to some fucked up places in my time, but that place is fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Aww-w, whatsa matter, is the little baby too
afraid to go into the big scary bar?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: That’s what you think?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s how you’re lookin’, Richie.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m lookin’ scared?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s what you look like.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You know what you look like?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No, Richie, what do I look like?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: You’re lookin’ green.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Where are you right now?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m here with you.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: No, you’re not. You’re sippin’ margaritas
in El Ray. But we’re not in El Ray. We’re here – getting ready to go in
there. You’re so pleased with yourself about getting into Mexico, you
think the job’s down. It ain’t. Get back on the clock. That’s a
fuck-with-you-bar. We hang around there for a coupla hours, in all
likelihood, we’ll get fucked with. So get your shit together,
brother.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: My shit is together.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: It don’t look together.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well, it is. Just because I’m happy doesn’t
mean I’m on vacation. You’re just not used to seein’ me happy, ‘cause
it’s been about fifteen fuckin’ years since I been happy. But my shit is
forever together.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Okay, just checkin’.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Take advantage of our penny pussy sale. Buy
any piece of pussy a tour regular price, you get another piece of pussy,
of equal or lesser value, for a penny. Now try and beat pussy for a
penny! If you can find cheaper pussy anywhere, fuck it!</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: What’s this? A new flavor approaching. Apple
Pie Pussy.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Step aside, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Not so fast, Slick.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Now, is my shit together, or is my shit
together?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Your shit is forever together!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Now this is my kinda place! I could become a
regular.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Whiskey!</p>
<p><strong>razor charlie</strong>: You can’t come in here.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What dya mean?</p>
<p><strong>razor charlie</strong>: This is a private club. You’re not
welcome.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Are you tellin’ me I’m not good enough to
drink here?</p>
<p><strong>razor charlie</strong>: This bar is for bikers and truckers
only. You, get out!</p>
<p><strong>big emilio</strong>: Walk, Pendaho.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Take your hand off me.</p>
<p><strong>big emilio</strong>: I’m going to count to three.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: No, I’m going to count to three.</p>
<p><strong>big emilio</strong>: Uno…</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Two..</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Now wait a minute, there’s no reason to get
ugly. There’s just a misunderstanding going on here. You said this bar
is for truckers and bikers, Well, I’m a truck driver.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: If you look outside your door, parked in your
parking lot, you’ll see a big ass recreational vehicle. That’s mine. In
order to drive that legally, you need a class two driver’s license. That
is the same license that the DMV requires truck drivers to carry in
order to drive a truck. of his wallet and lays it That is me, and this
is my class two license. This is a truck driver’s bar, I am a truck
driver, and these are my friends.</p>
<p><strong>razor charlie</strong>: Welcome to the Titty Twister. What
can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Bottle of whiskey and five glasses.</p>
<p><strong>razor charlie</strong>: Coming right up.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Good job, Pops.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s just fuckin’ typical. Biggest number
one problem with Mexico, it’s not service oriented. I was feelin’ so
good, and those fuckin’ spies brought me down.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Fuck ’em, shake it off.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You serve food, Jose?</p>
<p><strong>razor charlie</strong>: Best in Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I kinda doubt that. We’re grabbin’ a table,
send over a waitress to take our order.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Anytime you want a lap dance with that
broad, say the word. It’s on me, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>razor charlie</strong>: They’re not the normal road trash we
normally feed on. But it’ll be okay. No one knows they’re here.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Who else?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Pass.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why not, against your religion?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No, I do drink, I’m just not drinking
now.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Suit yourself, more for me. Scotty?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: How ‘bout you? are safer in here with us than
wandering around a Mexican border town all night long. Just don’t do
nothin’ stupid and we’ll all get along fine. Scotty, you sure you don’t
want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Okay, I’ll have one.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Sorry, Pops, but I’m drinkin’ and I don’t like
drinkin’ alone. Bottoms up, boy.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: How about you, cutie pie? Ready for round
two?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Hey, Dr. Frankenstein, I think you just
created a monster.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Why are you so agitated?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m still stewing about that ape laying hands
on me. And that fuckin’ bartender sticks a weed up my ass, too.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: He backed down.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: He’s smilin’ at us. But behind his smile, he’s
sayin’, “Fuck you Jack.” I hear that loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m gonna just sit here and drain this bottle.
And when I’ve drunk the last drop, if I still feel then, the way I feel
now, I’m gonna take this bottle and break it over his melon head.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Before we stepped in here, you told all of us
to be cool. That means you, too.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I never said do what I do, I said do what I
say.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Are you so much a fucking loser, you can’t
tell when you’ve won?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: What did you call me?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Nothing. I didn’t make a statement. I asked a
question. Would you like me to ask it again? Very well. Are you such a
loser you can’t tell when you’ve won? The entire state of Texas, along
with the FBI, is looking for you. Did they find you? No. They couldn’t.
They had every entrance to the border covered. There’s no way you could
get across. Did you? Yes, you did. You’ve won, Seth, enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Jacob, I want you to have a drink with me. I
insist.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: To your family.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: To yours.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Now, is your shit together?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Forever together.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: In that camper out there I saw a guitar. I
take it that’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yeah, it’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Go out and bring it in. I feel a song coming
on.</p>
<p><strong>razor charlie</strong>: And now for your viewing pleasure.
The Mistress of the Macabre. The Epitome of Evil. The most sinister
woman to dance on the face of the earth. Lowly dogs, get on your knees,
bow your heads and worship at the feet of</p>
<p><strong>santanico</strong>: Drink up.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Now that’s what I call a
fuckin’ show!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Earth to Richie. Don’t you wanna ask your new
friend to join us?</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well, then ask her, dumb ass.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Por favor, Senorita. Would you care to join
us?</p>
<p><strong>santanico</strong>: Muy bien, gracias.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Richie, you lucky bastard! Now, little lady,
you could of just as easily done that to me. Who a Nelly! You got my
dick harder ’n Chinese arithmetic.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Which reminds me of a joke. Little Red Riding
Hood is walking through the forest and she comes across Little Bo Peep,
and Little Bo Peep says: “Little Red Riding Hood, are you crazy? Don’t
you know the Big Bad Wolf is walking these woods and if he finds you
he’s gonna pull down your dress and squeeze your titties?” Then Little
Red Riding Hood hitches up her skirt and taps a .357 Magnum she has
holstered on her thigh and says: “No he won’t.”</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh, shit. Seth –</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Not now. So finally she comes across the Big
Bad Wolf and the Big Bad Wolf’s laughing and says: “Little Red Riding
Hood, you know better than to be walking around these woods alone. You
know I’m just gonna have to pull down your dress and squeeze your
titties.” Then Little Red Riding Hood whips out her .357, cocks it,
sticks it in the Big Bad Wolf’s face and says: “No you won’t. You’re
gonna eat me, just like the story says.”</p>
<p><strong>razor charlie</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: This piece of shit broke my finger and my
nose… then this fag kicked me in the ribs while I was down.</p>
<p><strong>big emilio</strong>: Up!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Fuck off, ape man!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Scarred for life, that’s how I am!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You thought it was pretty funny, didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Everybody be cool, or you’ll be just as dead
as these fucks!</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: Blood drips down the side of Seth’s
face.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: It splatters to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: Blood drips from Richard’s shoulder. It
falls to the floor, splattering.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Richie, look out!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Shoot her! Shoot her! Get her off!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Fucking Bitch!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Richie.</p>
<p><strong>whore</strong>: Dinner is served!</p>
<p><strong>santanico</strong>: Let’s see if you taste as good as your
brother.</p>
<p><strong>santanico</strong>: I’m not gonna drain you completely.
You’re gonna turn for me, You’ll be my slave. You’ll live for me. You’ll
eat bugs because I order it. Because I don’t think you’re worthy of
human blood, you’ll feed on the blood of stray dogs. You’ll be my foot
stool. And at my command, you’ll lick the dog shit from my boot heel.
Since you’ll be my dog, your new name will be “Spot”. Welcome to
slavery.</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: A WHISKEY BOTTLE FLIES THROUGH the AIR,
sailing end over end.</p>
<p><strong>big emilio</strong>: Noooooo!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: We may be in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hey, you, monkey man!</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: Anything you gotta say to them, say to
me first.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: You know what everybody says about me? I
suck!</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Stop the pain, stop the pain, stop the pain,
stop the pain, stop the pain…</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Ain’t they supposed to burn up or
something?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Richie, I’m sorry I fucked things up. You’d
really like it in El Ray. We’d find peace there. I love you little
brother, I’ll miss ya bad.</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: I’m glad you feel that way, Seth. I love
you, too.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Touch my brother with that stake, biker, and
vampires won’t need to suck your blood, they’ll be able to lick it up
off the floor.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: He ain’t your brother no more.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: That’s a matter of opinion, and I don’t give a
fuck about your’s.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Don’t be an idiot, he’ll kill us all!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>richard</strong>: Yeah, shut up.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Hold him down.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Richie, here’s the peace in death I could
never give you in life.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Peachy! Why shouldn’t I be? The world’s my
oyster, except for the fact that I just rammed a wooden stake in my
brother’s heart because he turned into a vampire, even though I don’t
believe in vampires. Aside from that unfortunate business, everything’s
hunky-dory.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Bullshit! You hate us. If you had half a
chance you’d feed us to them!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Then why didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I saved your life. I didn’t have to, but I
did. And I’m sorry you lost your brother. I’m sorry he’s dead. I’m sorry
everybody’s dead. Now, if we’re gonna get out of this we need each
other. And we need you sober and thinking, not drunk and…</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: At first I just thought it was birds.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: No, it’s more of a gnawing sound. Birds
peck, they don’t gnaw. Rats gnaw.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: It’s bats.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Give me a hand!</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: Watch out, girly!</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: Goddamn fuckin’ vampires.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: Fire!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: We’ll put this out. You stake the rest of
these fuckers.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: Way ahead of ya. What’s your name,
girly?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Kate, what’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: Sex Machine. Pleased to meet’cha. Kate,
let’s stake these blood-sucker fuckers.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: We got a problem!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Get this bastard off of me!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Is everybody okay?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Okay, does anybody here know what’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Yeah, I know what’s going on. We got a bunch
of fuckin’ vampires outside trying to get inside and suck our fuckin’
blood! That’s it, plain and simple. And I don’t wanna hear any bullshit
about “I don’t believe in vampires” because I don’t fuckin’ believe in
vampires either. But I do believe in my own two fuckin’ eyes, and with
my two eyes I saw fuckin’ vampires! Now, does everybody agree we’re
dealin’ with vampires.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You too, preacher?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m like you. I don’t believe in vampires,
but I believe in what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Good for you. Now, since we all believe we’re
dealing with vampires, what do we know about vampires? Crosses hurt
vampires. Do you have a cross?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: In the Winnebago.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: In other words, no.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: What are you talking about? We got crosses
all over the place. All you gotta do is put two sticks together and you
got a cross.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: He’s right. Peter Cushing does that all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I don’t know about that. In order for it to
have any power, I think it’s gotta be an official crucifix.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s an official cross? Some piece of tin
made in Taiwan? What makes that official? If a cross works against
vampires, it’s not the cross itself, it’s what the cross represents. The
cross is a symbol of holiness.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Okay, I’ll buy that. So we got crosses
covered, moving right along, what else?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Wooden stakes in the heart been workin’
pretty good so far.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: Garlic, holy water, sunlight… I forget,
does silver do anything to a vampire?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: That’s werewolves.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: I know silver bullets are werewolves.
But I’m pretty sure silver has some sort of effect on vampires.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Does anybody have any silver?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Then who cares?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: When’s sunrise?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: About two hours from now.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: So all we have to do is get by for a few more
hours and then we can walk right out the front door.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: Yeah, that’s true, but I doubt our
barricades, that door, those plastered windows and these walls will last
two more hours with those bat fucks fuckin’ with ’em.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Has anybody here read a real book about
vampires, or are we just remembering what a movie said? I mean a real
book.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: You mean like a Time-Life book?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: John Wesley Hardin, so mean he once shot a
man for snorin’.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I take it the answer’s no. Okay then, what do
we know about these vampires?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Aside from they’re thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Well, one thing, they might got super human
strength, but you can hurt ’em.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yeah, that bottle upside the head of
Santanico didn’t kill her, but it didn’t feel too good either.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: Another thing, you try and ram a broken
chair leg in a human, you better be one strong son-of-a-bitch. The human
body is one rough-tough machine. But these vamps got soft bodies. The
texture of their skin is softer, mushier. You can push shit right
through ‘em. Conceivably, if you hit one hard enough, you could take
their fuckin’ head off.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: You could take their head off.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Actually, our best weapon against these
satanic cocksuckers is this man. He’s a preacher.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: As far as God’s concerned, we might just as
well be a piece of fuckin’ shit. But he’s one of the boys. Only one
problem, his faith ain’t what it used to be.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’ve had enough of your taunts.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m not taunting you. We need you. A faithless
preacher doesn’t mean shit to us. But a man who’s a servant of God can
grab a cross, shove it in these monsters’ asses. A servant of God can
bless the tap water and turn it into a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I know why you lost your faith. How could true
holiness exist if your wife can be taken away from you and your
children? Now, I always said God can kiss my fuckin’ ass. Well, I
changed my lifetime tune about thirty minutes ago’ cause I know, without
a doubt, what’s out there trying to get in here is pure evil straight
from hell. And if there is a hell, and those monsters are from it,
there’s got to be a heaven. Now which are you, a faithless preacher or a
mean, mother fuckin’ servant of God?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I’m a mean, mother fucking servant of
God.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I don’t know if I can take two hours of that
noise.</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You can. You’ll take it ’cause ya got no
choice. How’d ya like twenty four hours of it, lying in a muddy ditch
with only the rotting corpses of your friends to keep you company?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: Back in ’72 I was in Nam, trapped behind
enemy lines, lying in a rat hole with my entire squad dead. They thought
they killed everybody, and except for me, they were right. But it wasn’t
for lack of trying. A grenade blew up right next to me, that’s why I’m
so pretty.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Thirst.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Thirst.</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: Stop fucking saying that!</p>
<p><strong>two male voices</strong>: Thirst!</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: That bite weren’t nothin’. It just hurt
like a son-of-a-bitch, that’s all. It barely punched the skin.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Thirst… Thirst… Thirst…</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: …and then when I came back to my senses, I
realized I had killed the entire V.C. squadron single handedly. My
bayonet had blood and chunks of yellow flesh on it like some cannibal
shish kabob. And to this day I don’t have the slightest idea how I –</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: I been bit! He fuckin’ bit me!</p>
<p><strong>frost</strong>: You’re dead, mother fucker! You’re gonna bite
me! You just turned me into a vampire, asshole!</p>
<p><strong>sex machine</strong>: What are you gonna do about it?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Good lord!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You wanna suck something, suck on this!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: We have to go back for Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Daddy’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Noooo!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: He’s right, Kate. Daddy’s dead! He was too
far away. If flinging that door and filling this room with those
bat-things would save him, I’d fling it. The only thing it’ll do is turn
us into one of them.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: He needs our help!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: He’s beyond our help. You saw him get bit. I
saw him get bit. We all saw it. You can’t help him. I’ve got no one left
to lose but you. I can’t be alone again. We’re sticking together.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Did he…?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Fuck, piss, shit! Mother fuckin’ vampires!
Mother fuckin’ vampires! Goddamn mother fuckin’ vampires!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You all are gonna fuckin’ die! I’m gonna
fuckin’ kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You bet your sweet ass you are, and I’m gonna
help you do it. But we ain’t got much time.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You’re gonna be okay, aren’t you, daddy?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No, I’m not. I’ve been bit. In effect, I’m
already dead.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Children, listen to me. I love you two more
than anybody. And I just want you to know you’ve made me proud all your
lives. But never more so than tonight. And I wish we could sit here and
cry till I pass on, but we can’t. Because I’m not going to pass on. I’m
going to turn into a monster. And when I do, I’m going to be dangerous.
But before that happens, just know I love you. Now, I’d say in the next
twenty or thirty minutes our friends outside will bust in this door. And
I’ll probably turn into a vampire within the hour. Now, you have two
choices. You can wait for me to turn, then deal with me, then wait for
them to burst inside here and the three of you will deal with them. Or,
we can kick open that door and the four of us can hit ’em with
everything we have, and carve a path right through ’em to front
entrance. But if we’re gonna go at ’em, we gotta go at ’em now. I
confused them, I scared them, I took them off guard. But they’re going
to get unconfused, they’re going to get unscared, they’re going to get
together and they’re going to hit that door like a ton of bricks. And
when that moment arrives, we gotta be ready.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What’s this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: My guess is that this little dive’s been
feeding on nomad road waifs like bikers and truckers for a longtime.
This is probably some of the shipments they stole off the trucks.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Well, I say lets tear this place apart for
weapons. So when they burst through that door, we’ll make ’em wish they
never did.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I don’t give a shit about living or dying
anymore. I just want to send as many of these devils back to hell as I
can.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Before we go any further, I need you three to
promise me something. I’ll fight with you to the bitter end, but when I
turn into one of them, I won’t be Jacob anymore. I’ll be a lap dog of
Satan. I want you three to promise you’ll take me down, no different
from the rest.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Kate, Scott?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Scott?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yeah, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Why don’t I believe you? I’m gonna ask you
two again, then I want you to swear to God that you’ll kill me. If you
don’t, I’m gonna just kill myself right now. Now, since you need me I
think you better swear. Kate, do you swear to God that when I turn into
one of the undead, you’ll kill me?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Kate, we don’t have all day, so I’m only
gonna count to five. One…two… three… four…</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Okay, okay, I promise I’ll do it!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Not good enough, swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I swear to God, our father, that when you
change into one of the undead, I will kill you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Good girl. Now, Scott, we have even less
time, so I’m only giving you the count of three. One…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: You don’t believe in suicide.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It’s not suicide if you’re already dead.
Two…</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Okay, I’ll kill you when you change, I swear
to God in Jesus Christ’s name.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Thank you, son.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Okay, vampire killers, let’s kill some fuckin’
vampires.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Kill ’em all!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Why did they block the door again?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: To keep the daylight out! This is where they
sleep! Get to the door!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Seth!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Okay, dead boys, come on! Take a bite and feel
all right!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: I’m going for ’em!</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Everybody goes home!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Die, monster, die! Die, monster, die!</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Watch my back!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I swear to God, in Jesus Christ’s name.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Fight now, cry later.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You bastards!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Kill me, Kate!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: How many bullets left, kid?</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Not many.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well, when you run out of weapons, just start
cold cocking ’em. Make ’em sing for their supper.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Should I use the last bullets on us?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You use ’em on the first couple of these
parasites that try to bite you.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Shoot more holes!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m looking for my friend. Is Seth in
there?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Carlos! Help us, bash the door. Bash the door
in!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Danny, Manny, knock down the door. Hurry,
hurry!</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: What the fuck was going on in there?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Whatsamatter with you? Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Why the fuck, outta all the god forsaken shit
holes in Mexico, did you have us rendezvous at that place?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I don’t know, one place’s as good as
another.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Have you ever been there before?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: No, but I passed by it a couple of times.
It’s out in the middle of nowhere. It seems like a rowdy place, so there
wouldn’t be a lot of police. And it’s open from dusk till dawn. You said
meet you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Well, because you picked that place out of a
hat, my brother’s dead now. And this girl’s family’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that. What were they,
psychos?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Did they look like psychos? They were fuckin’
vampires. Psychos don’t explode when sunlight hits ’em, I don’t care how
crazy they are.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Oh, Seth, how can I ever make it up to
you?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: You can’t, but fifteen percent instead of
thirty for my stay at El Ray is a good start.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Twenty-eight.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Jesus Christ, Carlos, my brother’s dead and
he’s not coming back, and it’s all your fault. Twenty.</p>
<p><strong>seth and carlos</strong>: Twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: You like the car?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I said new, this is an ’90.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: It’s hardly been used at all. I got it from
a drug dealer who only drove it 5 times in as many years. Swear to God.
That’s like new.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: So do I just follow you?</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Yeah, follow us.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: So let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>carlos</strong>: Vamanos!</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: Seth.</p>
<p><strong>kate</strong>: You want some company?</p>
<p><strong>seth</strong>: Kate honey, I may be a bastard. But I’m not a
fuckin’ bastard.</p>
