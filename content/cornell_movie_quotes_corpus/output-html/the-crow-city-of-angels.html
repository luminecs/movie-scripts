<h1 id="the-crow-city-of-angels">the-crow-city-of-angels</h1>
<p><strong>ext. limbo - day/night</strong>: A heavy mist hangs before us
- endless and impenetrable. And out of that primordial fog a CROW
materializes, flying toward the camera in slow motion.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I believe there’s a place where the restless
souls wander. Burdened by the weight of their own sadness, they cannot
enter Heaven…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And so they wait, trapped between our world
and the next, endlessly searching for a way to rid themselves of their
pain - in the hopes that somehow, some day…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: … they will be reunited with the ones they
love.</p>
<p><strong>“city of angels - october 29th - la noche de san
lucas”</strong>: CLOSE ON A PAIR OF HANDS tearing open a tiny glassine
envelope filled with powder - our drug du jour - Trinity. The face of
the envelope has been stamped with an image - a cartoon imp with a
shit-eating gring giving us the thumbs-up sign.</p>
<p><strong>following the envelope</strong>: as it flutters to the
ground, landing “imp-side” up. Let the rush begin.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: Garbage-poisoned waters
wreathed in fog. Although once part of a thriving shipping industry,
decades of decline have seen these docks become a hellish dumping
ground. Case in point:</p>
<p><strong>a father and his young son</strong>: are kneeling next to one
another at the end of a pier, their arms linked together, then tied
behind their backs. DANNY CORVEN is quietly sobbing. ASHE , tries to
calm the frightened boy.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m sorry, Dad…I’m sorry… I didn’t mean to
look…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: It’s okay, Danny. It’s okay…</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: Lights…</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: …camera…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A camcorder lens as it auto-focuses,
bringing Danny’s distorted face into view via the lens’ reflection.</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: …action.</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: Make-up.</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: Flowers for the dead, Senor?</p>
<p><strong>camera pov</strong>: Ashe stares directly into the
camera.</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: No? Suite yourself, then.</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: You’re wasting your breath, angelito.
Nobody up there’s listening.</p>
<p><strong>whoosh!</strong>: We cut to an extreme high-angle shot -
God’s omniscient POV, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: leans up against his motorcycle a few yards
away - big, burly, shaved head, a ciggie hanging from his lips. He’s got
a custom paint-job on his pearl drop gas tank - a buxom blonde doing the
“wild thing” with the Grim Reaper. Curve’s also the one who just dusted
himself</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Let’s get this over with. Judah’s
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I’m scared, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Listen to me, please. He’s just a kid. Let him
go. He can’t hurt you. He doesn’t even know who you are…</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Nothing personal, sport. Guess you were just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Dump ’em. Let’s get this cluster-fuck on the
road.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: motions to Kali and Spider Monkey. Together,
the three of them heave Ashe and Danny into the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Bon voyage, shitheads.</p>
<p><strong>ashe’s pov</strong>: falling further and further away from
the light of the surface world. Bit by bit, Ashe’s struggles subside.
All we hear now is an ever-slowing HEARTBEAT. Darkness begins to close
in around us, womblike, peaceful…</p>
<p><strong>…and out of the darkness,</strong>: something takes shape - a
CROW. Winging its way from Ashe’s dream-like death up through watery
depths into a smog-bound cityscape…</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: rides the thermals above an urban sprawl
riven by fires, floods, and earthquakes. Smog hangs in the air like an
army of ever-present ghosts. We pass over a roof where someone has
painted a smart-ass welcome mat for the benefit of anyone flying
overhead - “GO BACK”. Nevertheless, we continue on.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: They say that time cancels pain. I don’t know
about that. Eight years ago I lost two of my best friends. Two thousand
miles later I find I’m still living in the past…</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: sweeps down into man-made caverns of
pigeon-shit concrete and grimy glass. Through the bird’s eyes we glimpse
the city’s silent HOMELESS. Automobile hulks littering the streets like
insect husks. The shifting searchlights of police helicopters…</p>
<p><strong>we pass over sarah’s rooftop</strong>: The Crow circles
downward…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Every night when I close my eyes the dreams
come. That’s how the dead talk to us, I guess. In the dark, when our
souls are off wandering…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I just wish I understood what they were
telling me.</p>
<p><strong>crow’s pov</strong>: SARAH, early 20s, lies asleep in bed.
She stirs, troubled by uneasy dreams, rolls over, opens her eyes…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Hey, Gabriel…</p>
<p><strong>sarah’s artist loft</strong>: is furnished in thrift-store
treasures. The loft has an earthy warmth to it, in stark contrast to the
urban decay outside - an island amidst a sea of unrest, dominated by an
arching half-circle window through which Sarah can view the local
wildlife on the streets below.</p>
<p><strong>on sarah’s canvasses</strong>: Turbulent oils reminiscent of
history’s brooding symbolist painters. Give Sarah’s childhood
inspiration, the subject matter is no real surprise.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: reaches the shower, strips off her clothes.
Her back and upper arms are decorated with graceful tattoo work - a pair
of black angel wings sweeping over her shoulder blades. She’s got a ring
in her navel, another in a nipple…</p>
<p><strong>tarnished wedding ring</strong>: Once Shelly’s. There’s an
inscription inside - “FOREVER”.</p>
<p>****: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>a pale face</strong>: in a shadowed entryway. It’s a TEENAGED
GIRL , strung out on drugs. The girl cowers in a narrow stairway,
hugging herself, shivering from withdrawal.</p>
<p>****: Nice place you’ve got here.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: No place else to go.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Gotta name?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Grace. So what?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Listen, Grace, how does some hot coffee
sound? Maybe a little food?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Nothing. Guess you just remind me of someone
I used to know.</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: perched on a nearby rooftop, watching
them.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Almost finished. Doing okay?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Yeah, stings a little.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s why they call me the Mistress of
Pain.</p>
<p><strong>later -</strong>: Noah is closing up shop, while Sarah
sterilizes some needles in an autoclave.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: What a downer - this kid wanted me to tattoo
“If you’re reading this, you’re too close” on his bleedin’ bum!</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Christ, I’m knackered.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Beats pushing ink in Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: That it does, Princess, that it does.</p>
<p>****: Oh, I bought you a little present…</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: They do ’em for the Day of the Dead. Nice,
huh? Necrophagia, Princess. Eat the dead.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: “Life is just a dream on the way to death.” I
like that.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Want to grab a beer, then?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No, I gotta go home. Haven’t been sleeping
much lately.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: So, what’s the dirty dog’s name?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ve just been having some weird dreams.</p>
<p>****: You ever dream that you’re dying someone else’s death?</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Sorry, we’re closed.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: appears outside. He POUNDS harder on the
door.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Open the fucking door!</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: stands, moves to the door.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Look, I said we’re…</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: You think what you did to me is funny? Some
kind of joke?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What are you talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: I’m talking about the fucking tattoo you gave
me! I took off the bandages. Look…!!!</p>
<p><strong>curve’s tattoo</strong>: It’s a crow, rendered in bold
slashes of black. Or is it? Upon closer examination the crow looks like
something else - two demons fighting. The design is a classic ambiguous
figure - like the picture of the woman in front of a vanity which can
also be seen as a skull.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: A crow…</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Then what-the-fuck is it doing there?!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t know, I was just going from the
design you gave me…</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: What’s it going to be, hero? Ready to kiss
your faggot-ass good-bye? I think so. I think you’re shitting yourself
you’re so goddamn ready.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Over here, ass-hole…</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Agh!!! SHIT!!!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Shoulda killed me while you had the chance,
sugarplum. Be seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Fuck me, wonder what they’ll be snorting
next?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I just can’t do this anymore… I’m so tired of
this.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Easy there, luv. It’ll all work out.</p>
<p><strong>sarah’s pov</strong>: The Crow is perched on the hood of her
car. Sarah HONKS her horn in frustration. The Crow doesn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Get out of here! Go!!!</p>
<p><strong>camera moves up</strong>: over the side of the box. Although
mere inches in height, this enclosure might as well be the Great Wall as
far as our little member of the Coleoptera is concerned.</p>
<p><strong>as the camera continues to pull back</strong>: we see crime
lord Judah Earl’s lair in all its sepulchral glory…</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Talk to me, Sibyl. Tell me what you see.</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: I see Death returning from the veil of tears.
He has your name on his tongue.</p>
<p><strong>judah earl,</strong>: A sinewy, slash-mouthed Byronic figure
with a guttural voice. Old before his time, touched by childhood visions
of his own death. The tower is Judah’s prison in more ways than one.</p>
<p>****: It’s finally beginning, isn’t it? What mask will Death wear,
can you tell me that?</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: I see the face of one of your victims.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: All my sins remembered.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: SOMEONE’S SPEED-INDUCED POV. Performers
flaunt their flesh on a raised stage. CROWDS OF SEXUAL LIBERTINES and
CUTTING EDGE FETISHISTS writhe as one on the dance floor. Lots of
rubber, latex strap bodices, Victorian hoop skirts - it’s a modern-day
De Sade’s wet-dream.</p>
<p><strong>reverse angle</strong>: on Curve as he pushes his way
upstairs and through the tangle of flesh.</p>
<p><strong>the bartender,</strong>: a barrel-chested Samoan, sets a
drink down in front of Curve, nods a greeting. Curve sits back, opens
his shirt, nudges Spider Monkey.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Spider Monkey, what’s this tattoo look like
to you?</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: This a test?</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Come on, man, just tell me what you see.</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: A bird.</p>
<p>****: Think about it a minute. Don’t you see two demons?</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: Nope. I see a bird.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Ah, fuck you, then.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: …ohgodohgodohgod…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do you want from me?!</p>
<p><strong>close on sarah</strong>: Calm now, realization and a sense of
purpose dawning.</p>
<p><strong>presently the bodies of ashe and danny</strong>: come into
view, caught up in a tangle of razor wire.</p>
<p><strong>close on ashe’s face</strong>: Unaltered by the ravages of
time. His eyelids flicker, dreaming. A SINGLE TEAR escapes, flowing down
his cheek. We push on INSIDE</p>
<p><strong>his head…</strong>: We see brief MEMORY FLASHES of he and
Danny together…</p>
<p>****: “…midway through our life’s journey I came to myself within a
dark wood where the straight way was lost…”</p>
<p><strong>close on ashe’s face</strong>: His dead eyes suddenly open.
Confusion. Pain. Fear. A stream of bubbles rushes from his mouth,
obscuring our view.</p>
<p><strong>ashe’s pov</strong>: As the bubbles clear, Danny’s face comes
into focus just a few inches from his own.</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: flies on ahead, landing atop one of the
piles, staring down into the water.</p>
<p><strong>and as sarah</strong>: starts toward the bird we…</p>
<p><strong>flashbacks</strong>: of subjective POVs. The killers walking
down the jetty, marching Ashe and Danny to their deaths and…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: digs his fingers into the wood-rot pulp of the
pilings and claws his way up to the jetty. He collapses down onto the
wooded slats.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: crouches before us, his face hidden from view.
He reaches out his hand, touching an unmistakable BLOOD STAIN… Danny’s
blood stain. This triggers more painful memories…</p>
<p><strong>a dark figure</strong>: standing in front of him. It’s the
last thing Ashe sees before consciousness escapes him.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: emerges from the shadows, staring down at
Ashe in wonder.</p>
<p><strong>gabriel</strong>: perched at the end of the bed, watching
Ashe intently.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: sits on the other side of the loft in a
paint-smeared work-shirt, brush in hand. She’s studying a half-finished
canvas, contemplating her next move.</p>
<p><strong>canvas</strong>: The eerie scene depicting a woman on her
death-bed being cradled in the arms of her ghostly lover.</p>
<p>****: …who are you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: My name’s Sarah. I had a dream about you. I
saw them shoot you and your son…</p>
<p>****: …I saw you drowning.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: How did I survive?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Stop looking at me that way – stop looking –
this isn’t real, none of this is real! I’m dreaming this.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I’m dreaming this.</p>
<p><strong>camera whip-pans</strong>: from the fleeing Ashe to Sarah’s
window. On a pillar outside, the Crow is waiting…</p>
<p><strong>close on painting</strong>: An image rendered by a child’s
optimistic imagination - a crude father and sone, respectively labeled
“DAD” and “ME”. A FOOTPRINT mars the otherwise perfect memento. Ashe
touches the figure labeled “ME”, which triggers…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: Hey, Dad…what color should I make the
sun?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Blue.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: There’s no such thing.</p>
<p>****: No. Well there should be.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Danny, wait!</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: See no evil.</p>
<p><strong>danny’s voice</strong>: I’m sorry, Dad…I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>curve’s voice</strong>: Nothing personal, sport.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: stands in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I want to help you. I need to.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Everything’s so confused… Danny…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He’s not here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: There’s no moon…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’ve been given another chance, Ashe – to
put the wrong things right…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I believe there’ve always been people like
you…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s the pain that brings people back. It
makes us strong again.</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: flies alongside Ashe.</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: lands on a telephone wire, studying the
warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>crow’s pov</strong>: Ashe turns to the Crow, slyly giving the
bird the thumbs-up sign…</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: Ono!</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: ‘My mother was accursed the night she bore me
and I am faint with envy of all the dead’.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Tell me, Monkey. Does the corpse have a
familiar face?</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: Who the fuck are you?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: You have to learn to look beyond the mask.</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: No way, man…we put you under…you and
that little snot-nosed kid…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Looking for this?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Don’t try this at home, kids.</p>
<p><strong>boom! ashe</strong>: puts a bullet through his own forehead.
His head snaps backward and his body collapses onto the floor. Spider
Monkey creeps forward toward Ashe’s body…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: springs from the ground, SLAMMING Spider
Monkey against a table of chemicals. Bottles SHATTER on the floor,
spilling their toxic contents.</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: What are you?! What the fuck are
you?!</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I wasn’t sure at first. Now I know. I’m the
boiling man, Monkey. I’m the plague of Darkness and the death of the
first-born. All your nightmares rolled into one.</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: Whoa…this shit’s flammable! Look,
look, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: The others. Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: Nemo. Kali. Judah. And Curve.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I’ll start with Nemo, then work my way up the
food chain. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: Nemo? Nemo’s an old gash-hound. He
hangs out at the Peep-O-Rama on Deacon Street!</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Congratulations, monkey. You just bought
yourself a fighting chance.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Pick a card, monkey.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Lady Luck’s a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>spider monkey</strong>: Aw, Jesus, c’mon, man!</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: You’re wasting your breath, angelito. Nobody’s
up there listening.</p>
<p><strong>close on match</strong>: as Ashe scrapes his thumb-nail over
the head…</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: spirals down from a telephone wire,
landing atop the handlebars of Ashe’s motorcycle.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: lifts his head to the night sky, laughing. His
clothes are still smoking.</p>
<p><strong>sarah’s sketch pad</strong>: She’s working on a rendering of
Ashe. She sits back…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: …and all the world will be in love with
night…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do you believe in fate, Noah?</p>
<p>****: Seeems to me it’s more a question of fate believing in you.</p>
<p><strong>close on curve</strong>: as he studies the shattered glass
which litters the asphalt. The fire is reflected in the fragments. With
a growing sense of dread, Curve looks from the glass to the tattoo on
his chest. He touches the Crow tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>scene from above -</strong>: Now we see that the glass shards
have fallen in an array that is anything but random. The shards have
taken the shape of a large crow.</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: flys past a line of palm trees which burst
into flames.</p>
<p><strong>a video camera</strong>: recording the pornographic act for
posterity. Pull further back to include…</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: lounging on a couch a few dozen yards away,
watching the women on four video monitors, detached and twice removed
from the sex play.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: enters from out of the shadows. Judah looks
up to him.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Bad news.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Illuminate me.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Someone torched the lab on Manchester. Spider
Monkey’s a fucking crispy critter.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Monkey I could care less about. What about
our merchandise?</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: A total loss.</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: He left a sign, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: Yes you do. You’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: You’ve been marked.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Jesus Christ, Judah, why the fuck to you
listen to her?!</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Because she speaks the truth.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: What’s this, Curve? A beauty mark?</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: Your enemy wears the mask of the Crow. The
bird of ill-omen.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: The Crow. Death’s avatar. I’ve heard the
legends.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: looks down at a view of the seething
landscape.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Let him come, then.</p>
<p><strong>college!“</strong>: As Nemo approaches, a laconic HINDU with
a throat microphone sits outside, reciting his tired schpiel.</p>
<p><strong>hindu</strong>: Tokens for the buddy booths, live girls.
Tokens for the buddy booths, live girls…</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: You got a name?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Holly Daze. Do you want me, baby?</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: I need to see some sugar.</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: Right on, sister…</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Mmmm. Is that for me?</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: Yeah, we’re gonna celebrate Christmas a little
early this year.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Keep doing that, honey, you’ll go blind.</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: Time’s almost up, lover. Better hurry up with
those tokens.</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: Shitfire…</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: Come on, fucker!</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: is standing on the other side of the
Plexiglas. His mouth splits into an evil grin.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: “Do you want me, baby?”</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Hey, mime boy.</p>
<p><strong>at the front counter.</strong>: ZEKE, the Peep-O-Rama’s
corpulent manager, is cradling a sawed-off shotgun. BOOM! He blows a
blast into Ashe’s chest!</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: One crow sorrow…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: …two crows joy…</p>
<p><strong>doll</strong>: Ooh, oh baby, I like it like that. You’re so
good. You’re so good…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Three crows a letter, four crows a boy…</p>
<p><strong>close on a spinning token</strong>: On one side of the coin
the eye is open, on the other it’s closed - this creates the illusion of
the eye blinking.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Five crows silver, six crows gold…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Seven crows a secret never to be told.</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: …please, please just stop…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: You killed my son, Nemo. You took away the
only piece of light left in my soul.</p>
<p><strong>nemo</strong>: We had to! Judah’s orders. Never leave any
witnesses! We didn’t have a choice!</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: We always have a choice.</p>
<p>****: …no…</p>
<p><strong>holly daze dancing</strong>: Jump-cut bump and grind,
CAT-CALLS, LAUGHTER, the distorted faces of men leering with their
hungry eyes, tongues and sweaty palms and heavy breath and I wanna be
your fucking dog, baby, and…</p>
<p><strong>bang! ashe</strong>: shuts his eyes, reeling…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: If you value what you’ve lost, you’ll walk
away from this place and never look back.</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: Inside!</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: is sitting atop one of the cars, watching
him.</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: Nemo?</p>
<p><strong>doll’s voice</strong>: Ooh, oh baby, you’re so good…</p>
<p><strong>camera finds nemo’s body</strong>: at the end of the
corridor, lounging in the arms of the sex doll which is still repeating
its tinny refrain. Nemo’s neck has been snapped and his head hangs at an
awkward angle.</p>
<p><strong>doll</strong>: …oh! Oh yea, that’s the spot. Do me, baby. Do
me.</p>
<p><strong>ashe’s voice</strong>: Do you know what they call a gathering
of crows, Curve?</p>
<p><strong>ashe’s voice</strong>: A murder. A murder of crows. Think
about it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. street/church - night</strong>: Ashe exits a phone
booth, leaving the receiver dangling. A DOG BARKS nearby, followed by
the sound of CHILDREN LAUGHING. Ashe turns and sees…</p>
<p><strong>a small, inner-city latino church</strong>: sandwiched
between two derelict buildings. The doors are open - there’s a path of
marigold petals leading up the front steps. The skull dog trots up the
steps and enters.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I’m sorry, Father, I was just watching…</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Our doors are open.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: What is this for?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Dias de los Muertos, the Days of the Dead.
We light the candles for our loved ones - so that they might find their
way back to earth and share in the pleasures of the living.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Tomorrow night we will celebrate. The people
will dance, sing… …many will wear masks.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Some spirits linger here too long. They
become confused, mistaking themselves for the living. They have to be
frightened away.</p>
<p><strong>a little boy</strong>: is watching Ashe from one of the back
pews. He clutches a striped ball. He drops it.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Santa Muerte.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: appears on the ledge of the broken window,
crouching there like a gargoyle in silhouette.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You came back…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Heaven wouldn’t have me and Hell was afraid
I’d take the place over.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I needed to see you again.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: She looks like you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I paint what I see.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Were you married?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It belonged to a friend.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Where are they now?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: A better place.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Danny’s mother left after he was born. She was
a drug addict.</p>
<p>****: I lost my mother the same way.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Small world.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I left Detroit because I wanted to put the
past behind me.</p>
<p>****: The problem is, I know how it ends. Blood. Violence. I don’t
want a part of it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: What happens to me when I finish what I’m
supposed to do here?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You go back.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: What if I don’t want to go back?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Then you’re damned</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: It was him. It was that son of a bitch we
dumped off the pier. I know it.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: I thought you killed him.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: I shot him in the head!</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: He’s a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: No such thing as ghosts.</p>
<p>****: Then who killed Spider Monkey and Nemo?</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: All I know is, he’s fucking with us. The
Crow’s his symbol, right? That means I’m marked. It means he’s coming
for me now!</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: I thought you said you didn’t believe?</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Look, you want to tell yourselves some
bullshit fairytales, that’s your business. But i’m not gonna sit here
with a fucking target on my chest. I’m going to take this motherfucker
out!</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: You won’t stop him with bullets or knives. He
doesn’t feel pain. He doesn’t bleed. Don’t you see? His soul has crossed
over. He’s come back from the other side.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: So how do you stop a man who’s already
dead?</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: Can you look destiny in the eye without
flinching?</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: The Crow is the source of his power - his
link between this world and the next. Sever that link and he’s as
vulnerable as the next man.</p>
<p><strong>close on postcard</strong>: A carnival midway set on the
beach, people strolling along a boardwalk, golden sand and blue skies.
WORDS at the top of the picture read: “WISH YOU WERE HERE”.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I’ve been here.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I took Danny last summer. We went up on the
bike, rode all the way up the coast…</p>
<p>****: It was cold up there. I remember we could see each other’s
breath.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ashe. Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: No… We can’t do this…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I have to finish what I started. I have to
find the others.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I wish I’d met you before.</p>
<p><strong>display window of a bakery</strong>: Within the bakery are
mountains of sugar skulls, candy skeletons, and pan de muerte . Ashe’s
reflection is superimposed over this morbid tableau.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: So the Crow is Ashe’s familiar… Can his power
be taken?</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: The bird is the key, the life-force that
flows within it…</p>
<p>****: The blood of the Crow.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: The tattoo on your chest, who gave it to
you?</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Some bitch down at the Gargoyle, but what’s
that got to do with…</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Everything, you idiot! Find her. If she gave
you his mark, then she’s connected to him in some way. She can lead us
to him.</p>
<p><strong>the painting</strong>: which Danny had been working on. It’s
got bullet holes in it now.</p>
<p><strong>on ashe,</strong>: as seen from afar. A tiny figure dwarfed
by the endless expanse of ocean and sky.</p>
<p><strong>“november 1st - noche de los muertos”</strong>: Curve and
Kali have duct-taped Noah to one of the dentist chairs - even his mouth
and nose have been sealed shut. Curve lets Noah thrash a moment, then
violently rips the tape from Noah’s face.</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: Look, what do you people want?</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: A house in the country, a dog, a wife and two
kids…</p>
<p>****: …your fucking head stapled to my saddlebags.</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: We’re looking for Sarah. Where is she,
Noah?</p>
<p><strong>noah</strong>: I’m not going to tell you that…</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: Oh, but I think you are…</p>
<p><strong>close on the needle</strong>: a vibrating blur just a few
centimeters from Noah’s blinking eye. Noah tries to shut his eyes. Kali
forces an eye open with the thumb and forefinger of her other hand.</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: Last chance, “love”.</p>
<p>****: Get bent, you dried-up bitch.</p>
<p><strong>the crow tattoo</strong>: is dripping blood from its beak and
talons.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: No…no…</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: Curve!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: NOTE: The following scene appears here in
the script, but in the film it appears in Chapter 12.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: …goawaygoawaygoawaygoaway…</p>
<p><strong>time slows to a crawl</strong>: The MUSIC fades to a muted
echo of distant WAR DRUMS. As a feeling of inexorable doom settles over
him, Curve lifts his head and sees…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: reflected in the bar mirror, materializing out
of the narcotic haze. He’s wading through the ocean of bodies. In his
face paint and black leather Ashe looks like he’s just another part of
the twisted scene. people are stroking him, brushing up against him -
like they can leech off some of his morbid angel charisma.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Time’s up, Curve.</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: Fuck you, bird-dick!</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: plunges down from the night sky, wings
flapping madly, quickly gaining on Curve like the breath of death.</p>
<p><strong>up above,</strong>: Ashe appears on the overpass, riding on
his own motorcycle, matching Curve’s speed.</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: soars higher for a bird’s eye view,
tracking Curve’s progress as it sweeps past chimneys, swerves around
billboards, ducks under laundry lines…</p>
<p><strong>on ashe</strong>: as he ROCKETS along the overpass. The Crow
lands on his shoulder. Ahead is a break in the guard rail. Ashe cuts
sharply to the right, taking the motorcycle airborne through the break
in the rail and…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: …lands on the surface street some thirty feet
below! Ashe is now just behind Curve.</p>
<p><strong>up above them</strong>: the Crow lands on the skylight,
staring down at Sarah, watching…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah’s pov</strong>: Kali stands there, cradling an
automatic. She’s flanked by TWO IDENTICAL TWIN THUGS. Kali FIRES into
the lock…</p>
<p><strong>curve’s pov</strong>: We are now beneath the bridge. It’s a
stone-cold dead-end. The roadway slopes sharply downward, spilling out
into the concrete river bed which is filled to capacity with rushing
flood waters.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: We hear the ROAR of an approaching
motorcycle, then an engine cutting out. Curve looks back the way he
came…</p>
<p><strong>at the opposite end of the tunnel</strong>: Ashe’s
siilhouette steps into view. He’s on foot now, clutching the sawed-off
shotgun. He lets loose a LAUGH which chills Curve to the bone.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: “I have a rendezvous with Death, on some
scarred slope of battered hill…”</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: “God knows, ’twere better to be deep where
love throbs out in blissful sleep, pulse nigh to pulse and breath to
breath…”</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: “But I have a rendezvous with Death. And I to
my pledged word am true…”</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: “I shall not fail that rendezvous.”</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: You think i’m afraid of you, you fucking
freak?! YOU THINK I’M</p>
<p><strong>boom! curve’s motorcycle</strong>: disintegrates beneath him,
breaking apart into a RUSHING COMET OF FLAMING WRECKAGE. Shrapnel skids
along the tunnel walls, SPEWING</p>
<p><strong>curve</strong>: lies on the garbage-strewn tunnel floor in a
spreading pool of blood - burnt, battered, a barb of steel sticking up
from his chest. Still, Curve has one glorious, giddy moment where he
thinks he’s actually succeeded in defeeating Ashe, then…</p>
<p><strong>curve’s pov</strong>: as Ashe steps through the gasoline
flames.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Can you hear me, Curve?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: You’re going to die now.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: People used to put coins in the mouths of the
dead. Do you know why? So they could pay the ferryman to take them
across the river Styx. What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Open your mouth, Curve.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Shhh. It’s not so bad. Trust me. I’ve been
there.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I want to thank you for showing me my pain,
Curve. You made me what I am.</p>
<p><strong>on ashe</strong>: As he releases Curve, letting the current
carry him away. Ashe stands, tracking Curve’s progress.</p>
<p><strong>on curve</strong>: as he floats downstream, limbs
outstretched, consciousness fading fast.</p>
<p><strong>curve’s pov</strong>: GHOSTLY FACES stare down at him from
the girders - people who have made their home in the underbelly of the
bridge which stretches overhead.</p>
<p><strong>pull back to reveal</strong>: the petals have clustered
around Curve’s body in the shape of a Crow. Curve continues to float
downstream towards an estuary, borne away on the wings of the bird.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: is seeing what the crow is witnessing - Sarah
in danger.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Sarah!</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Sarah?!</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: Sarah’s gone, ghost man.</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: who had been standing still amidst the
shadows, now moves from behind Sarah’s paintings.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: Judah’s tower. He’s waiting for you there.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: You took my son’s life.</p>
<p>****: Some people are born victims.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: It takes two to make a murder.</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: Shall we dance?</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: is standing a few yards away, cloaked in
darkness, head bowed. Sarah didn’t notice her at first.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: The Tower. Everyone finds their way here
eventually.</p>
<p><strong>sibyl’s empty eye sockets</strong>: have been sewn shut with
black thread.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: My God. What happened to you…?</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Fate happened to her.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: emerges from the gloom, almost as if he were
materializing from the shadows themselves.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Sibyl’s been cursed with the gift of
prophecy. She sees things that are fated to happen…</p>
<p>****: She cut her eyes out with a carving knife because she wanted to
make the visions stop…</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: …but that only made the visions stronger,
didn’t it, dear?</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: I’ve learned to live with my affliction.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Don’t we all.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Judah Earl.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: My reputation precedes me.</p>
<p>****: I’ve seen what your drugs have done to this city.</p>
<p>****: I saw a need, I exploited it. It’s all economics, Sarah. Supply
and demand.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why did you bring me here?</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: I’m glad you asked that, Sarah. You’ve got a
very important part to play in this little drama of ours. You see, I
intend to capture the Crow…</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: … and you, my dear, are the birdseed.</p>
<p><strong>close on kali</strong>: lies on the ground, her limbs twisted
at awkward angles. She MOANS, somehow still alive.</p>
<p><strong>kali’s pov</strong>: as Ashe approaches. The Crow flits in
from off-screen, landing on his shoulder. Watching Kali with it’s
curious golden eyes.</p>
<p>****: I…can’t…move…</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: Kill…me, then…finish…it…</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: You…have to.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: My job is to send you to hell. You’re in
it.</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: There’s no…honor in this. It’s my…death. I’ve
won it..</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>kali</strong>: Wait! Where are you going?! Wait! You can’t…do
this! You can’t do this!!!</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: lands on Ashe’s outstretched hand.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Have you ever read Dante’s Inferno? It says
that the only true path through Hell lies at its center. If you want to
escape it – you have to go further in.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: When I was a boy I fell through the ice of a
lake. I remember seeing the sky through the ice above me, close enough
to touch. The world grew cold around me. Dark. Eventually my heart
stopped beating. And in that moment, I died.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: A half-hour later I awoke on an operating
table. I had returned to the world of flesh and bone – But I brought a
knowledge back with me… Forbidden knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: I’ve been living on borrowed time ever since.
I’ve always known Death would be coming for me.</p>
<p>****: I see now that your friend is the one I’ve been waiting
for.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You can’t stop him.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: You’re wrong, Sarah.</p>
<p>****: There is a way to defeat Death… and that’s to trade places with
him.</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: The Crow is coming.</p>
<p><strong>a horse-drawn carriage</strong>: piloted by a man in a devil
mask suddenly looms up in front of Ashe. The street ahead has been
cordoned off with flashing wooden barricades. There’s some kind of
street fiesta going on…</p>
<p><strong>crow’s pov</strong>: Sarah sits within one of the pools of
illumination far below, still bound to the bed by the chain. Judah and
Sibyl are nowhere in sight.</p>
<p><strong>the crow</strong>: flies down from the rafters, landing on
the floor at Sarah’s feet. It CAWS at her, trying to communicate.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: …go…please go…</p>
<p><strong>crow’s pov</strong>: as Judah emerges from the darkness,
crouching down on the floor to study the Crow. He grins.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Look who’s come home to roost.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: pushes through the throng of revelers,
invisible amidst the carnival atmosphere. In his makeup he’s just
another face in the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>camera table</strong>: The camera lens is now trained on the
night sky. A churning landscape of night-sky coulds drifts across the
table’s surface, creating an eerie effect.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: sets a package wrapped in velvet on the
camera table. He peels back the cloth, revealing a set of ornately
decorated, tapered daggers. He looks back at Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Do you know what these are called?
Misericords. Wonderful name, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Easy, little wing. It will all be over
soon.</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: who has been lurking in the shadows, suddenly
lifts her head up…</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: Ashe is here.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Not for long.</p>
<p><strong>close on ashe’s hand</strong>: Blood seeps from a stigma-like
wound on his palm.</p>
<p><strong>ashe’s pov</strong>: Day of the Dead CELEBRANTS crowd the
streets far below.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: …oh God…help me…</p>
<p><strong>stone maiden</strong>: which protrudes from the building’s
facade. The maiden’s face has been all but worn bare by the harsh
elements.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>the sky above</strong>: seems to churn and roil. A storm of
epic proportions is about to break.</p>
<p><strong>crow’s anamorphic pov</strong>: as Judah reaches for a third
misericord. He raises it high above his head, preparing for the coup de
grace.</p>
<p>****: Ashes, ashes, we all fall down…</p>
<p>****: No!!!!</p>
<p><strong>city street</strong>: The Day of the Dead celebrants swirl
around us, Judah’s Tower rising up behind the mob - an unholy ziggurat
built to challenge the gods. The CROWD has been worked up into a frenzy.
Everyone is singing and dancing. MUSIC blasts from loudspeakers…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: comes CRASHING DOWN atop a small vending stall
filled to the brim with flowers an sugar skulls. Time slows as a flurry
of golder marigold petals flutter down around his still form.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: It’s done.</p>
<p><strong>as we watch, the image of the clouds</strong>: cast by the
camera lens onto the table begins to ripple and dissolve, only to be
replaced by Judah’s own, shimmering reflection.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: With a shaking hand, Judah dips his
fingers into the pooling blood and begins to paint his face. A swatch of
blood over one eye, then a swatch over the other. A long, bloody smear
over his lips…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: watches with a mixture of mounting horror and
morbid curiousity.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: scoops up a handful of the Crow’s blood and
brings it to his lips.</p>
<p><strong>close on judah’s lips</strong>: as he drinks, letting the
overflow trickle down over his chin and neck.</p>
<p><strong>close on judah’s face</strong>: his once-pallid features now
glow with a kind of beatific radiance.</p>
<p><strong>we rise up</strong>: from Judah, up and up into the darkest
reaches of his tower. Judah is LAUGHING, laughing in the face of Death
itself.</p>
<p><strong>the masked celebrants</strong>: slowly gather around Ashe,
craning their necks for a view of the fallen angel.</p>
<p><strong>close on ashe’s face</strong>: Relaxed, peaceful, even. For a
moment, we aren’t sure whether or not Ashe’s soul has fled.</p>
<p><strong>the crows</strong>: Thousands of them, filling the heavens
with their KEENING WAILS.</p>
<p><strong>ashe’s pov - the sky above judah’s tower</strong>: is black
with crows. And endless army of carrion-creatures, swirling madly
about.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Ashe sits up, stares at the crows,
fascinated, frightened. Then his eyes fall to the faces of the people
around him. We are in dream-time now, blurring the edges of reality.</p>
<p><strong>a child</strong>: wearing a skull mask pushes to the front of
the crowd. He stares at Ashe a moment, then lifts the mask from his
face…</p>
<p>****: Danny…?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: What are you doing here?!</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: It’s time to go back, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Is that why they’re here?</p>
<p>****: They’re the souls who came before you. They’re crying for the
people they’ve lost.</p>
<p>****: Now they’re crying for you.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: But Sarah still needs me.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You don’t understand, Dad. You work for the
dead, not the living. Your work here is done.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I can’t go, not yet, not now…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: You have to.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Danny, I can’t leave her like this…</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: If you turn your back on the dead now, you’ll
be trapped between the worlds. You’ll never be allowed to cross
over.</p>
<p>****: You’ll be alone, Dad. Forever.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I have to stay.</p>
<p><strong>danny</strong>: I know.</p>
<p>****: Good-bye, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Danny, wait…!</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: standing just a few yards away, emerging from
the doorway of his tower. He got the anti-Crow blood mask on his face.
His eyes are glowing like twin stars and his lips are curled back in a
feral snarl. In his hands, he holds one of the chains from his
campanile.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Tell me, Ashe. Do you every get the feeling
we’re all just dead men on leave?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Judah.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: In the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: What…are…you?</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: I’m your shadow, Ashe. Every angel’s got a
devil. Didn’t you know that? Or maybe you just slept your way through
Sunday school?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: What… did you do to me…?</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: I’ve tasted the blood of the Crow and taken
your power.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: You’re flesh and blood now, Ashe. You can die
like any other man.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Already been there. And I must confess, I
liked what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: Ashe needs you now. More than ever.</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: Go to him.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Looks like the dead have forsaken you, my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Look at you, bleeding like a stuck pig.
Where’s your precious strength? Where’s your power? You’re nothing now,
Ashe, not even a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: down the street. Ashe SCREAMS as his body is
dragged across the asphalt…</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: shouts to the crowds below, his eyes on
fire.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: You want death?! Here he is, people!!! Take a
good look!!!</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: is dragged up into the air, dangling above the
faces of the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Now don’t we look pretty…</p>
<p><strong>the tattered painting</strong>: of Danny’s that Ashe had kept
in his coat pocket to fall free. It flutters to the ground, landing at
Judah’s feet.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: Nice. If you prick him, does he not
bleed?</p>
<p><strong>close on ashe</strong>: His eyes are rolling to whites as
consciousness begins to recede…</p>
<p><strong>ashe’s pov</strong>: The swirling faces of the masked
celebrants, with Judah front and center. Mob mentality, everyone drunk
and LAUGHING, jeering at Ashe, the dangling fool. It’s a scene out of
Hell…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: lunges forward, clutching the misericord,
shoving a reveller aside…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Get away from him!</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: falls to the street as the chain CLATTERS over
the street lamp. He unravels the chain from his throat and drags himself
back up…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Sarah, get back!</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The crows…I can see them coming…</p>
<p><strong>sarah’s pov</strong>: Once again, the crows are wheeling
around the ceiling of the sky.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Ashe looks up at Judah, fueled by a
righteous rage that’s been burning since the moment of his resurrection.
He rises. All reason is gone. The only think that remains for Ashe is an
unbridled animal fury.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: You can’t stop me anymore, Ashe. You don’t
have the power.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: If it were just me, you’d be right, Judah. But
I have an eternity of pain to call upon…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: And the pain gives me strength.</p>
<p><strong>ashe’s palms</strong>: As we watch the stigmata close
themselves up, blood drawing itself back into the wounds.</p>
<p><strong>judah</strong>: lets loose a DEATH-SHRIEK that all but splits
the sky as the myriad beaks and talons rend him limb from limb.</p>
<p><strong>down in the street,</strong>: Ashe returns to Sarah’s side,
lifting her up off the ground and cradling her in his arms.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: You can’t die, Sarah… I stayed for you.</p>
<p>****: There’s a balance that needs to be kept…someone had to cross
over…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I didn’t want it to be you…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: I can’t go with you, Sarah. I have to stay
here now. I have to stay.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Take…this…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ll wait for you. Forever, if I have to.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Listen…if two people really love each
other…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: …nothing can keep them apart. …nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sarah’s pov</strong>: Ashe’s face, surrounded by a nimbus of
light. We’re falling away from him. Down, down, down. And as we fall, we
hear a FLUTTERING</p>
<p><strong>on sarah’s face</strong>: Her eyes lose focus. Her head goes
slack in Ashe’s arms. She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>the day of the dead crowd</strong>: slowly part for him,
revealing a path of marigold petals leading away down the street. It’s
almost as if, by silent consensus, the crowd has come to understand what
has happened here this night.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: moves through the crowd carrying Sarah in his
arms. The people close ranks behind him and we…</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: is carrying Sarah in his arms, moving through
the crowd of silent witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>sibyl</strong>: nods to herself, satisfied. We see what might
be a trace of a smile cross her lips.</p>
<p><strong>the stag beetle,</strong>: free at last, quickly scurries out
of the box and across the table, disappearing into the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: Why are you still here?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: Because I have nowhere left to go.</p>
<p><strong>priest</strong>: What will you do, then?</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: This city is filled with shadows. One more
won’t make it any darker.</p>
<p><strong>close on the ring</strong>: as Ashe turns it over in his
hands, seeing the word “FOREVER” inscribed on the inside of the band. He
slips it on his finger.</p>
<p>****: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>grace,</strong>: the drugged-out girl that Sarah helped at
the beginning of the film. She’s looking good now, clean of the poison
that once possessed her. And damned if she isn’t holding Gabriel in her
arms.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Long night, huh?</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Isn’t he cool? I found him on the street. I
was going to take him home with me.</p>
<p><strong>ashe</strong>: You should. Looks like he needs a home.</p>
<p><strong>grace</strong>: Well, see ya.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I believe there’s a place where the restless
souls wanter…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Burdened by the weight of their own sadness,
they cannot enter Heaven…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: And so they wait, trapped between our world
and the next, endlessly searching for a way to rid themselves of their
pain - in the hopes that somehow, some day, they will be reunited…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: …with the ones they love.</p>
<p><strong>cut to black.</strong>: Over the darkness we hear Sarah’s
final words to Ashe:</p>
<p><strong>sarah’s voice</strong>: If two people really love each other,
nothing can keep them apart…</p>
<p>****: Nothing.</p>
