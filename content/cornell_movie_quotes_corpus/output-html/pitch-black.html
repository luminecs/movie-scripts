<p><strong>fry</strong>: Hear me? Cap’n? Some kinda compromise to the
hull…holding for now, but…Goddamn, I’m glad you’re alive. Gotta pull
your E-release…no, red handle, red handle. I’ll get the warm-ups out
while –</p>
<p><strong>phfut-phfut-phfut-phfut</strong>: Particles bore through the
cabin, blasting open the captain’s chest, shattering plexi, DETONATING
INSTRUMENTS on the opposite wall and leaving CONTRAILS HISSING in the
air.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Why did I fall on you?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: He’s dead. Cap’n’s dead. Christ, I was looking
right at him when –</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: I mean, I mean, chrono shows we’re 22 weeks
out, so gravity wasn’t supposed to kick in for another 19. I mean, I
mean, I mean, why did I fall at all?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You hear me? Captain’s dead. Owens too.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Oh, no. Not Owens, not…. Wai’, wai’, wait.
I’m Owens. Right?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Cryo-sleep. Swear to God, it sloughs brain
cells.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: 1550 millibars, dropping 20 MB per minute,
shit, we’re hemorrhaging air. Somethin’ took a swipe at us.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Just tell me we’re still in the shipping
lane. Just show me all those stars, all those bright, beautiful,
deep-space….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Jesus God….</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: They trained you for this, right? Fry?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: … crisis program selected Number Two of this
system because it shows at least some oxygen and more than 1,500 – would
you</p>
<p>****: – more than 1,500-millibars of pressure at surface-level. Okay,
so maybe the ship did something right for a change….</p>
<p><strong>multiple shots</strong>: EXPLOSIVE BOLTS RAPID-FIRE around
the ship’s skin, blowing away non-essentials that hinder aerodynamics –
including big deep-space drives. But this last separation puts the ship
into a dangerous roll.</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: …showing no major water bodies…maximum
terrain, 220 meters over mean surface… largely cinder and gypsum with
some evaporite deposits….</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Fry? What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Fry?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Can’t get my nose down…too much load back
there….</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: You mean that “load” of passengers?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: So what, we should both go down too? Out of
sheer fucking nobility?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Look, Fry. Company says we’re responsible for
every one of those –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Company’s not here, is it?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: When captain went down, you stepped up –
whether you like it or not. Now they train you for this, so –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: And there wasn’t a simulated cockroach alive
within 50 clicks of the simulated crash site! That’s how they train you!
On a fucking simulator!</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Don’t touch that switch!</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I’m not dying for them.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Owens!</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: 70 seconds! You still got 70 seconds to level
this beast out!</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: What the shit was that?</p>
<p><strong>nightmare shot</strong>: A huge section of the cabin tears
free… skitters and CRASHES along the planetfloor behind us…and
disintegrates out of sight. 40 cryo-lockers vanished with it. 40
lives.</p>
<p><strong>fry’s pov</strong>: A vortex of motion, of speed, of blurring
debris. But the ship is burrowing in. Burrowing under.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Somethin’ went wrong, huh?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: One chance and you blew it, Riddick. Never
cease to disappoint me.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Hey, who?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Hey, me. Over here.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Amazing. I’m Johns.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Carolyn Fry. I’d shake hands, but…</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Are there any others, Johns?</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Out, out, out, GET IT OUTTA ME!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Pull it out of him…No, it’s too close to the
heart…You gotta do it, just do it fast….</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Don’t touch it! Don’t touch that switch!</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: You’ll kill him, I’m tellin’ you, shit, just
leave it alone…delirious…doncha you got some drugs for this poor
man….</p>
<p><strong>owens</strong>: Don’t touch that switch!</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Awright, awright, someone…there’s Anestaphine
in the med-lock, that end of the cabin…next to….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Get away. Everybody.</p>
<p><strong>wide shot</strong>: All around them is stark and unforgiving
terrain. The valley floor is relieved only by low hills to one side,
spiked with earthen spires. Scorching down on everything are two suns –
one red, one yellow.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Well. Our own little slice of heaven.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Please…which way to New Mecca? We must know
the direction in order to pray.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Big talk about a scouting party…</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: …then we saw this.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Anyone else having breathing problems? Aside
from me?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Like I just ran, or something….</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Feel one lung short. All of us.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Well, I tend toward the asthmatic. And with
all this dust….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: It’s the atmosphere. Too much pressure, not
enough oxygen. Might take a few days to –</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: So what the bloody hell happened, anyways?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Somethin’ knocked us off-lane. Maybe a rogue
comet. Maybe we’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Well, I for one, am thoroughly fucking
grateful. This beast wasn’t made to land like this. But cripes, you rode
it down. C’mon, you lousy ingrates, only reason we’re alive is a’cuzza
her.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Liquid oxygen canisters inside. Start ripping
them out. Quick hits only – try to make it last.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Well, is someone coming for us? Or are we
all just gonna die of exposure or dehydration or sunstroke or maybe even
something worse? Hey, you don’t have to worry about scaring me.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: We’re worried you’ll scare us. Name’s
“Audrey,” right, love? And you’re goin’ to Taurus Three like we
were?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Yeah, but…do we even have enough food to get
there? Or will we have to resort to cannibalism?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: I’ll see ‘bout makin’ this air go a bit
further, cap’n. With your permission, a’ course.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: And him?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Big Evil?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: We just keep him locked up forever?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Be my choice. Already escaped once from the
max-slam facility on –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I don’t need his life story. Is he really that
dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Only around humans.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Oh, Christ….</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Well? Is it just the pump?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Ask if anyone has anything in cargo! Anything
to drink!</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Mine here….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: S’matter?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Little swamp-flu from the Conga system. Never
shook it with all this cryo-sleep.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: King Tut’s tomb….</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Be surprised what these will fetch in the
Taurus system. Here. This Wooten here – easy, easy. Very rare.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: This is it? Booze? That’s what you have to
drink?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: 200-year-old single-malt scotch is to “booze”
as foie gras is to “duck guts.”</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: A toast to whatever he just said.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: I’ll need a receipt for that. For all
these.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Top of my list.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I don’t suppose….</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: One of the Christian habits we didn’t adopt –
perhaps unfortunately. We’ll have to wait.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: For what? There is no water. You understand
that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: All deserts have water, somewhere. God shall
lead us there.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Like we needed another way to die.</p>
<p><strong>fast closeups</strong>: Hands pillaging storage lockers,
pulling out anything that might qualify as a “weapon.” It all gets
hauled back and dumped into…</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: What the hell are these?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Maratha crow-bill war-picks from Northern
India. Very rare.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: An’ this?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Blow-dart hunting stick from Papua New
Guinea. Very very rare, since the tribe’s extinct.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: ’Cuz they couldn’t hunt shit with these
things, be my guess.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Well, what’s the need, anyway? If he’s gone,
he’s gone. Why should he bother us?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: First, because he can only live out there for
so long – he’s gonna come back and take what we got. Second, for the
sheer thrill of the kill.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Imam. We should leave soon. Before nightfall
but while it’s cooler.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: What, you’re goin’ off, too?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Johns is leaving you a gun. Just do me a favor,
huh? Get my crewies buried? They were good guys who died bad.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: A’course we will.</p>
<p><strong>pilgrim #1</strong>: Imam…Imam….</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: My bloody oath….</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Three suns?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: So much for your nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: So much for my cocktail hour.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: We take this to be a good sign – a path, a
direction from God.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: A very good sign. That’s Riddick’s direction.
You do not wanna be caught in the dark with this guy.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Thought you found his restraints over there.
Toward sunset.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Which means he went toward sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: So quiet. You get used to the sounds of the
ship, then….</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: You know who Muhammad was?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Some prophet guy?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: “Some prophet guy.” And a city man. But he had
to travel to the desert – where there was quiet – to hear the words of
God.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You were on a pilgrimage? To New Mecca?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Chrislam teaches that once in every lifetime
should there be a great hajj – a great pilgrimage. To know God, better,
yes, but to know yourself as well.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Frightening thought.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: We’re all on the same hajj now.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Tell me it’s not a mirage.</p>
<p><strong>scope pov</strong>: Beyond a distant rise, strange
branches.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Trees?</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Comfy up there?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Amazing how you can do without the essentials
of life – so long as you have the luxuries.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Well, just keep your bloody-fuckin’ eyes open.
Don’t want that ratbag sneakin’ up on me bloody-fuckin’ arse.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: He’d probably get you right here, right
under the jaw. And you’d never hear him coming. That’s how good Riddick
is.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Now did you run away from your parents? Or
did they run away from you?</p>
<p><strong>pilgrims</strong>: Allahu Akbar…Allahu Akbar….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Is this whole planet dead?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: He asks what could have killed so many great
things…</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Some…communal graveyard, perhaps… like the
elephants of Earth….</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Long time ago. Whatever happened.</p>
<p><strong>pilgrim #1</strong>: Ah….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Probably makes it worse. Dehydrates you even
more.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Probably right.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: You know, I woulda played road dog for these
guys. You could’ve stayed back. Pro’bly should’ve – because, you know,
if we don’t find water….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: No, no, I wanted to get away.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: So I noticed. Never seen a “captain” quite so
ready to leave her ship.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Better keep moving….</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: What’d Owens mean? ’Bout not touching the
switch?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Promise me. Swear to me you won’t –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: You see anybody else here? Just between you
and me.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: During the landing…when things were at their
worst…Owens was at his best. He’s the one who wouldn’t let the pilot
dump the passenger cabin.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: So now you know.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Fuck. Guess I’m more glad to be here than I
thought.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Hold up.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Didn’t bite.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Thought he might be coolin’ it in the
boneyard – could either double-back to the ship or slip in behind us. So
I left the bottle out as bait.</p>
<p><strong>scope pov</strong>: PANNING the boneyard. FINDING the bottle.
It’s still got that one swallow.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: But nah. Didn’t bite.</p>
<p><strong>pilgrim #1</strong>: Captain…captain….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Wait, wait, wait….</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: We are not alone here, yes?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Never thought we were.</p>
<p><strong>high angle</strong>: An old WEATHER COCK CREAKS in the wind.
Fry, Johns, and the Chrislams enter FRAME far below.</p>
<p><strong>pilgrim #1</strong>: Assalamoo ahlaykum!</p>
<p><strong>pilgrim #2</strong>: Assalamoo ahlaykum!</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Long gone. Whoever they were.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Water…water there was here….</p>
<p><strong>pilgrims</strong>: Allahu Akbar….</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: “God is Great,” yes?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: I’m born-again.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Lights.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Hey. Don’t go too far, huh?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: No darkness. No lights because no
darkness….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Allahu Akbar!</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: This now qualifies as the worst fun I’ve ever
had. Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Audrey? Oh, Audrey….</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Tell me that was you.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Okay, it was me. What’d I do now?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Assailing my fragile sense of security,
that’s what.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: What’re you goin’ on about? She’s been right
here for the last….</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Zeke?</p>
<p><strong>hull-crack pov</strong>: Far away, Zeke finishes digging the
grave. He starts toward the ship.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>total stranger</strong>: I thought…my God, I thought I was
the only one who….</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Oh, Lord….</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: It was just somebody else. From the crash.
He was just….</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Cripes galore, I thought it was him. The
murderin’ ratbag. I thought he was….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: No juice, looks like it’s been laid up for
years. But we might be able to adapt –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Sorry. Thought I heard something.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Like my pistola.</p>
<p><strong>zeke</strong>: Now what the bloody hell….</p>
<p><strong>burrow pov</strong>: Staring back at Zeke.</p>
<p><strong>furious closeups</strong>: Zeke fighting for his life. PISTOL
BLASTING. Something slashing at him. Blood dancing on air.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Same crap, different planet, huh?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: …I don’t play that…I don’t play that so just
try again. C’mon, Riddick, tell me a better lie….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Ease up, ease up. JOHNS! Just tell me
what….</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: What’d you do with ’im? You bloody sick
animal you, what’dja do with me Zeke?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: He used that?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Sir Shiv-a-lot. He likes to cut.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: So why isn’t it all bloody?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: I assume he licked it clean.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: So where is he?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Tell me about the sounds. You told them you
heard something right before…. If you don’t talk to me, Johns’ll take
another crack at it – at your skull.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: ’Mean the whispers?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: What whispers?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: The ones tellin’ me to go for the sweet
spot – just to the left of the spine, fourth lumbar down. The abdominal
aorta. What a gusher. Had a cup on his belt, so I used it to catch a
little run-off. Metallic taste to it, human blood. Coppery. But if you
cut it with peppermint schnapps, that goes away. Course, that’s more for
winter. Summertime, I take mine straight.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Why don’t we try the truth now?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: All you people are so scared of me – an’
most days, I’d take that as a compliment – but it ain’t me you gotta
worry about now.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Show me your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Show me, Riddick.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You did this? To yourself?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Slam doctor. Well, we called him
“doctor.”</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Heard about it. Just never seen it.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Fairly fuckin’ ironic, wouldn’t you say?
Slamlight’s so dim that you go and get your eyeballs taken out and
shined up – then you wind up here. Three ass-kick suns. Maybe I did do a
few people. But not this one. No ma’am, not this time.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Then where is he? He’s not in the hole. We
looked.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Look deeper.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: I know what happened – he went off on the
guy, buried him on the hill somewhere, and now he’s trying to –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Let’s just be sure.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: I am sure. Look, murders aside, Riddick
belongs in the Asshole Hall of Fame. He loves the jaw-jackin’, loves
making you afraid, ’cuz that’s all he has. And you’re playing right into
–</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: We’re gonna find the body, Johns. Christ,
you’re a cop. Why am I tellin’ you this? We gotta go down and find
it.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Well, don’t ask me to.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Thought you didn’t believe his story.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: I don’t. But that ground looked none too
stable, and I don’t want anyone –</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: If you’re afraid, I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Nobody else is going down but me, okay?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Hey. Bein’ ballsy with your life now doesn’t
change what came before – it’s just stupid.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: What, you think I’m doin’ this to prove
something?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: You said it, not me. Let’s just not let one
bad call lead to another.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Thanks for the tip, Johns.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: They’re hollow….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Here! I’m in HERE, HERE, HERE!</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Did you hear….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I’m over here in the –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Oh, God….</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: We got you…it’s okay, it’s okay…we got you
now….</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: The child heard you before any of us could
even….</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Did you find him? You find Zeke?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: …wasn’t Riddick…it was…it was… goddamn, that
was stupid….but wasn’t Riddick. Somethin’ else down there that got Zeke
and nearly got –</p>
<p><strong>fast shots</strong>: Survivors packing up O2, liquor,
umbrellas, the Koran – whatever qualifies as “essential” on this planet.
Amid the activity, Audrey pauses to look at…</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: One is all?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: For now.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Found somethin’ worse than me, huh?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: We’re movin’. And I’m just wondering if I
shouldn’t lighten the load right now.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Woof, woof.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Want you to remember this moment, Riddick.
The way it coulda gone and didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Say that again.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Here’s the deal. You work without the chains,
without the bit – without the shivs. You help us get off this rock….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: For what? The honor of goin’ back to some
asshole of a cell?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Truth is, Riddick, I’m tired of this head-up
shit. I wanna be free of you as much as you wanna be free of me.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: You’d cut me loose, Boss?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Only if we both get outta this alive. And
there may be a way.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: My recommendation: Do me. Don’t take the
chance that I’ll get shiv-happy on your wannabe ass. Ghost me, Riddick.
Would if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: If you were me, I’d kill us both. C’mon, you
wanna sit at the grown-up table or not?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Want you to remember this moment.</p>
<p><strong>extremely wide</strong>: Blue sun setting, yellow and red sun
rising. The survivors trek for the settlement. Fry and Imam lug the
power cell between them, but the real load is shouldered by…</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: So just like that. Wave your little wand and
he’s one of us now.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Didn’t say that. But least this way I don’t
have to worry about falling asleep and not wakin’ up.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Well, I feel we owe Mr. Riddick amends.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Oh, right. Let’s all line up and beg his
forgiveness. Right you are.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: At least give the man some oxygen….</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: He’s happy just bein’ vertical. Leave him
be.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: So I can talk to him now?</p>
<p><strong>johns/shazza</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Paris P. Ogilvie. Antiquities dealer,
entrepreneur.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Richard B. Riddick. Escaped convict,
murderer.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: You know, if I owned Hell and this planet…I
believe I’d rent this out and live in Hell.</p>
<p><strong>fry’s pov</strong>: Of spires high above us.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: I mean, usually I can appreciate antiques,
but, uh….</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Little ratty-ass.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Nothing we can’t repair – so long as the
electrical adapts.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Not a star-jumper.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Doesn’t need to be. Use this to get back up
to the Sol-Track Shipping Lanes, stick out a thumb. You’ll get picked
up. Right?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Little help here?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Check those containers for me. See what we
can patch wings with.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Okay, that should buy us a sys-check. But we’ll
need more cells.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: 15 6-gigs here…90 gigs total…other ship carries
20-gig cells, so…five. Five total to launch.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: 25 kilos each, huh?</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Old sand-cat outside. See if I can’t get it
up and chuggin’.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Do it. And if you need an extra hand, tap our
problem child out…. Where’s Riddick?</p>
<p><strong>robot</strong>: “…to all intruders. I am the guardian of this
land. I will protect my masters at all cost. Death to all
intruders…”</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Missin’ the party. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Missin’ the party. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Talkin’ to me?</p>
<p><strong>pilgrim’s pov</strong>: Of Audrey exiting the trash bin and
running after Riddick and Johns.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: …and for this, our gift of drink, we give
thanks in the name of our Prophet, Muhammad, peace be upon him, and to
our Lord, Jesus Christ of Nazareth, and to his father, Allah the
Compassionate and the Merciful.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: The strangest religion….</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Perhaps we should toast our hosts. Who were
these people, anyway? Miners?</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Looks like geologists. Advance team, moves
around from rock to rock.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Musta crapped out here, huh?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: But why did they leave their ship?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Well, just a skiff. Disposable, really.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Like an emergency life-raft, right?</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Sure. Coulda had a real drop-ship take them
off-planet. Long gone.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: A toast to their ghosts, then….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Didn’t leave, these people. Whatever got
Zeke got them. They’re all dead.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: What, you don’t really think they left with
their clothes on the lines? Photos on the walls?</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Maybe they had weight limits, you don’t
know.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: I know you don’t uncrate your emergency
ship unless there’s a fucking emergency.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Rag it, Riddick. Nobody wants your theories
on –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: So what happened? Where are they, then?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Has anyone seen the young one? Ali?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Has anyone checked the coring room?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Ali….</p>
<p><strong>chaotic shots</strong>: More NESTS EXPLODE into individual
creatures, winged hatchlings moving like bats in a fire, talons hacking
and slashing. His exit blocked, Pilgrim #3 veers into…</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Ali?</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Why was the door chained up? Why the bloody
hell would they lock themselves in like that?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Not sure, but tell you what: Chrislams better
not be diggin’ another grave out there.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Other buildings weren’t secure…</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: …so they ran here. Heaviest doors. Thought
they’d be safe inside, but… Someone forget to lock the back door.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: So that’s what come of me Zeke. An’ you saw
it. You was right there.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: You were tryin’ to kill him too.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Just wanted his O-2. Though I notice he
tried to ghost my ass. When he shot up that stranger instead.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Take it.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: What, it’s broken?</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Startin’ to acclimate, anyhow. Take it.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Let’s board this up and get the hell gone.
They seem to stick to the dark, so if we stick to daylight, should be
all –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: 60 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Wha’?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Core-samples are dated. Last one is 60 years
ago. This month.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: Yeah? What’s special about that?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Dunno. Maybe nothing, but….</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Are you fuckin’ kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Not afraid of the dark, are you?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: …need those cells from the crash ship. Shit,
still gotta check out the hull, patch the wings –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Let’s wait on the power cells.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Wait for what? Until it’s so dark we can’t even
find our way back to –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: We’re not sure when it happens, so let’s not
–</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Get the fucking cells over here, Johns. What’s
the discussion?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Ever tell you how Riddick escaped?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: He can pilot?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Hijacked a prison transport, made a helluva
good run ’fore I tracked him down.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Okay, maybe that’s a good thing. Maybe I can
use him to help with –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: He also figured out how to kill the pilot,
Fry.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You said we were going to trust him now. You
said there was a deal.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: That’s what I said.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Oh, this is a dangerous game you’re playing,
Johns.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: May’ve noticed chains don’t work on this guy.
Only way we’re truly safe is if he believes he’s goin’ free. But if he
stops believin’ –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You mean, if he learns that you’re gonna
royally fuck him over.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: – we need a fail-safe. Bring the cells over
at the last possible minute – when the wings are ready, when we know
we’re ready to launch.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You know, he hasn’t harmed any of us. Far as I
can tell, he hasn’t even lied to us. Just stick to the deal, Johns. Let
him go if that’s what it –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: He’s a murderer. The law says he’s gotta do
his bid.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Dancin’ on razor blades here…</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: I won’t give him a chance to grab another
ship – or to slash another pilot’s throat.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Bad sign. Shakin’ like that in this
heat.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: I’ll cut.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Looks like we’re a few shy….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Power cells.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: They’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Strange, not doin’ a run-up on the main
drive yet. Strange unless he told you the particulars of my escape.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I got the quick-and-ugly version.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: An’ now you’re worried about a repeat of
history?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Entered our minds.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: I asked what you thought.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You scare me, Riddick. That’s what you wanna
hear, isn’t it? There, I admit it, Can I get back to work now?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Think Johns is an do-right man? You think I
can trust him to cut me loose?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Why, what’d you hear?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Well, guess if it was trickeration he’d
just do me, huh? Then again…I am worth twice as much alive. Didn’t know?
Johns ain’t a cop. Oh, he’s got that shiny badge an’ all, but nah – he’s
just a merc and I’m just a payday. That’s why he won’t kill me. The
creed is greed.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Save it, Riddick. We aren’t gonna turn on each
other – no matter how hard you try.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: I don’t truly know what’s gonna happen when
the lights go out, Carolyn – but I do know that once the dyin’ starts,
this little psycho family of ours is gonna rip itself apart. So you
better find out the truth. Come nightfall, you better know exactly who’s
standing behind you.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Oh, ask him ’bout those shakes. And ask why
your crew-pal had to scream like that ’fore he died.</p>
<p><strong>closeups</strong>: Hands select a red-metal shotgun shell
from a box… pull the shell open…remove a glass ampule hidden inside…drop
the ampule into a injection syringe. The syringe touches an eager arm
vein.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Who are you? Really?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You’re not a real cop, are you? Just some
mercenary who goes around talkin’ about the law like –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: I never said I was.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Never said you were a hype, either.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: You have a little caffeine in the morning, I
have a little morphine. So what?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: And here you got two mornings every day. Wow,
were you born lucky?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Not a problem unless you’re gonna make –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You made it a problem when you let Owens die
like that. When you had enough drugs to knock out a fucking
mule-team.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Owens was already dead. His brain just hadn’t
caught on to that fact.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Anything else we should know about you, Johns?
Christ, here I am lettin’ you play games with our lives when –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: My first run-in with Riddick. Went for the
sweet-spot and missed. They had to leave a piece of the shiv in there. I
can feel it, sometimes, pressing against the cord. So maybe the care and
feeding of my nerve-endings is my business.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You coulda helped. And you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Yeah, well, look to thine own ass first.
Right, “captain”?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: What do my eyes see?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: It’s starting….</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: If we need anything from the crash ship – I
suggest we kick on. That sand-cat’s solar.</p>
<p><strong>multiple shots</strong>: Shazza cranking the sand-cat…hands
snatching up lights, water, ropes…Chrislams piling aboard the
sand-cat.</p>
<p><strong>shazza</strong>: We stay together! C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Don’t wanna miss this.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Lookit. Lookit!</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Don’t stop, don’t stop….</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Jesus, how many can there….</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Just a suggestion, but perhaps we should
flee.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Cargo hold, everyone in the cargo hold. lesgo,
lesgo, lesgo.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Tell her to stay there. Stay down.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: No, no, NO, NO, NO….</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: In degraded image, we see the
predators – adult hatchlings – emerge from the spires. They’re large,
mammalian, hammer-headed. They CLICK with echo-location, sounding out
the world they haven’t inhabited in 60 years.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: What is it? What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: The predators launch from the hills,
gliding, SOUNDING, searching.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Like I said. Ain’t me you gotta worry
about.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What if…what if she’s still out there… still
alive….</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Well, I don’t want to jump to conclusions
here…but ‘member that boneyard? These just might be the fuckers that
killed every other living thing on this planet, okay? Chances of Shazza
knockin’ on that door anytime soon are just about zero squared.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I saw the cut-marks on the bones. Wasn’t a
natural die-off.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Quiet, please. Everyone.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Why do they do that? Make that sound?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Perhaps the way they see. With sound,
reflecting back.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Echo-location. That’s what it is….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Breach in the hull. I dunno.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: I’d rather piss glass.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Well, you got the big gauge.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Wanna rag your fat mouth?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Maybe it’s just their beads again. Imam, are
you still –</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: No, no, no, I do not believe –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: C’mon, man, you’re drivin’ everybody bugfuck
with those things. Why don’t you just lose the goddamn….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Big beads.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Okay. We’re okay. Just some small ones that
musta –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Very big beads.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Not staying in here another….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Christ, you don’t know what’s out there!</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: I know what’s in here!</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Everybody come, this way and we should be
safe. Hurry, please….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Can you do sumpin’ else with that? ’Sides
holding it in my fucking face?</p>
<p><strong>series of shots</strong>: Again and again, they burn a new
escape hatch just as the predators break into the container being
vacated, always entering darkness.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Hello, hello?</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Of dead hatchlings on the floor. This
is the open container, the one where Johns found predators.</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Of an adolescent predator. It squats
atop cargo, eating a hatchling. A heavy bone-blade crowns its skull.</p>
<p><strong>predator pov</strong>: Of Riddick.</p>
<p>****: The PREDATOR POV is a crude image that gives impression without
detail. We’re “seeing” what the predator hears with echo-location. Think
of a sonagram that strobes and wraps its</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Don’t. Move.</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: As a second predator appears above
them. This one reaches down with its scythe blade…</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Imam? Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Hasan?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Riddick?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: No….</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: A third predator appears above
him.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: ’Sokay, ’sokay. I killed it.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: There….</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Like the light is scalding it.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: It hurts them. Light actually hurts them….</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Is that…Hasan?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: We’ll burn a candle for him later. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: …one cutting torch…one handlight here, two more
in the cabin…I think two more….</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Spirits. Anything over 45 proof burns
well.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: How many bottles?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Not sure. Ten?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Those umbrellas, the ones that mist. Would they
burn? If you got a receipt?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Awright. So maybe we’ll have enough light.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Enough for what?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Oh, lady. If you’re in your right mind, I
pray you go insane.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: We can stick to the plan. If we get four cells
back to the skiff, we’re off this rock.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: I hate to kill a beautiful theory with an
ugly fact, but that sand-cat won’t run at night.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: We’ll have to carry the cells…drag
them…whatever it takes.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You mean…tonight? With all those things
still out there?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Oh, sure. Why not? Sounds like a hoot.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Back it up. How long can this last? Few
minutes? Couple hours?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: I had the impression…from the model… that the
two planets were moving as one. That there would be…a lasting
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Those suns gotta come back sometime. And if
these animals really are phobic about light, we just sit tight till
then.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I’m sure that’s what someone else said. Locked
inside that coring room.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Look, we gotta think about everyone now – the
kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Oh, don’t use her like that, for a smoke
screen.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Smoke screen for what?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: For your own fear.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Hey. Why don’t you rag your hole for two
seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn’t involve
MASS SUICIDE?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: How much you weigh, Johns?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: What the hell’s it matter?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: 79 kilos.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Because you’re 79 kilos of gutless white meat,
and that’s why you can’t come up with a better plan.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Think about that reward, Johns.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: I’m willing to take a cut in pay.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: How ’bout a cut in your gut?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Oh, Trash Baby, you’re gonna regret this.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Please…this solves nothing…please….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: They’re afraid of our light. That means we
don’t have to be so afraid of them.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: And you’re certain you can find the way back?
Even in the dark?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: No, I’m not. But he can.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Riddick.</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Checking the cabin. Finding a lot of
wreckage but no life.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Looks clear.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Fuck me. You said “clear.”</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Said “looks clear.”</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Well, what’s it look like now?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Looks clear.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Just get the goddamn lights on….</p>
<p><strong>prep montage</strong>: We see the survivors powering up cabin
lights… yanking three more cells from the battery bay…threading nylon
cord through Paris’ misting umbrellas, filling the reservoirs with
high-octane liquor…swapping out O2 canisters.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Ready, Johns.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: He’ll lead you over the first cliff. You know
that, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: We’re just burnin’ light here.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: You give him the cells and the ship – and he
will leave you. He will leave you all out there to die.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I don’t get it, Johns. What is so goddamn
valuable in your life that you’re worried about losing? Huh? Is there
anything at all? Besides your next hype? Got no right to be so scared.
Neither one of us.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Keep the light going. That’s all we have to do
to live through this. Just keep your light burning.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Be runnin’ about 10 paces ahead. I want
light on my back – but not in my eyes. And check your cuts. These things
know our blood now.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Riddick…was thinkin’ we should make some kind
of deal. Just in case, you know, this actually –</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Had it with deals.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: But I just wanted to say –</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Nobody’s gonna turn a murderer loose. I
fuckin’ knew better.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Been a long time since anyone’s trusted me.
That’s somethin’ right there.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: We can, can’t we? Trust you?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Actually… That’s what I been askin’
myself.</p>
<p><strong>series of tracking shots</strong>: Riddick running point,
goggles off, eyes flashing. Johns and Imam pulling the drag-sled like
malamutes, handlights sweeping. Pilgrims #1 at the first side- guard
position, Fry and Audrey at the second, each position carrying an
umbrella torch, FIREBALLS BLAZING. Paris stumbling along at rear-point,
sweeping the cutter back and forth, every shadow a threat. They are a
train of light.</p>
<p><strong>fry’s pov</strong>: Of the ground. The sand-cat tracks have
vanished.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: So you noticed too?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Riddick. Riddick.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Where are the sand-cat tracks? Why aren’t we
still following them?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Saw something I didn’t like.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Such as.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Hard to tell, sometimes…even for me… but
looked like a bunch of those big boys chewin’ each other’s gonads off.
Thought we’d swing wide. Okay by you?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Let’s move. Just a detour. He’ll get us
there.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Can we switch?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: What, switch what?</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: I think I twisted my ankle running backwards
like that. And I’m not sure I can…. Okay, that’s a lie. I just don’t
want to be alone back there anymore. If you could just give me a few
minutes up front here –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: She’s the pilot, she should stay close to the
cells.</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Oh, so I’m disposable?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I’ll switch, I’ll switch! Christ, just get this
train moving!</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Light, please, need light here….</p>
<p><strong>predator’s pov</strong>: Dive-bombing the girl.</p>
<p><strong>a high-velocity clicking</strong>: It’s like an incoming
missile. Imam lunges at the last nanosecond…</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Please…have we been cut? Can someone tell me
if….</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Oh, sweet Jesus….</p>
<p><strong>paris</strong>: Oh, sweet Jesus, WILL YOU GET ME SOME</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Of predators feasting on Paris.
Carrying a youngling on its back, a female predator arrives late and
can’t find a place at the trough. With shocking apathy, it whips the
youngling off its back and begins devouring it. Other predators start
in-fighting, killing themselves for food. POV PANS to a pair of
predators, closer, SOUNDING out new prey. POV PANS AGAIN to include the
object of their desire. Audrey.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: What do you see? Riddick?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Hunger. I see 60 years of hunger.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Bottle-count.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Four fulls, one half. That mean we’re
halfway there? I hope?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Can we pick up the pace?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: We aren’t completely stupid.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Stay in the light! Everybody! Stay in the
fucking –</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: We crossed our own tracks.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: He’s running us ’round in circles. Look for
yourself. Look!</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Riddick? What the hell are you –</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Listen.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Canyon ahead. I circled once to buy some
time to think.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Think about what?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: About how to kill us and still get these
cells to the skiff. Goddamnit, we’re just doin’ the heavy lifting for
this prick!</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: About the girl.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: What it’s gonna be like when we hit that
canyon. With her bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: What’re you jaw-jackin’ about? Girl’s not
cut.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: No. She’s not.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: I didn’t want you to leave me there… back at
the ship…that’s why I didn’t say anything….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: No, we’d never….Oh, God, honey, you shoulda
told me sooner.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Aw, this can’t be happening to me….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: They been nose-open for her ever since we
left. They go off blood.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Well…we must keep her close, then. Here,
she’ll be safe if we put her between –</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: There is no “safe.”</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: It’s not gonna work. We gotta go back.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Hey, you’re the one who got me out here,
turned me into a goddamn sled dog. An’ now you ’spect me to go back like
a whipped dog?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I was wrong. I admit it. My bad, okay? Now
let’s just go back to the ship.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: I dunno. Nice breeze, wide open spaces – you
know, I’m startin’ to enjoy myself out here.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Are you fucking high again? Just listen to
–</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: No, no, you’re right, Fry. What’s to be
afraid of? My life is a steamin’ pile of meaningless toadshit anyhow. So
I say mush on! Canyon’s only couple hundred meters, after that we’re in
Skiff City! So why don’t you just butch up, stuff a cork in that kid,
and get –</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: She’s the captain, we should listen to –</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Listen to her? Her? When she was willing to
sacrifice us all?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What’s he talkin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: During the crash, she –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: This does not help us, Johns.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: – she tried to blow the whole fucking
passenger cabin, tried to kill us –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Just shut up, okay?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: – tried to kill us in our sleep. Paris had it
right – we are disposable. We’re just walking ghosts to her.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Would you RAG YOUR STUPID HOLE!</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: We’re not alive because of her – we’re alive
in spite of her.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: We cannot go through there….</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: How much you weigh right now, Fry? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Fine, fine, you’ve made your point. We can all
be so scared as you.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Verdict’s in. The light moves forward.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Ain’t all of us gonna make it.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Just realized that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Six of us left. If we could get through that
canyon and lose just one, that’d be quite a fucking feat, huh? A good
thing, right?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Not if I’m the one.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: What if you’re one of five?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What’re they doin’ up there?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Talking about the canyon, I suppose. How to
get us through.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Look, it’s hellified stuff – but no different
than those battlefield doctors when they have to decide who lives and
who dies. It’s called “triage,” okay?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Kept calling it “murder” when I did it.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Either way, figure it’s something you can
grab onto.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Sacrifice play. Hack up one body, leave it
at start of the canyon. Like a bucket of chum.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Trawl with it. There’s a cable on the sled.
We can drag the body behind us.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Nice embellishment.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Don’t wanna feed these land-sharks – just
keep ’em off our scent.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: So which one caught your eye?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Don’ look, don’ look, don’ look….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Imam. Slow down.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Don’t stop, just slow down. Little more space
’tween us and them.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: I would rather we all stay–</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Do what I say. Please.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: What’s her name, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: What do you care?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Then let’s not name the Thanksgiving turkey,
okay? I assume you still got a shiv.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: What, you ’spect me to do it?</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: What’s one more to you? Like this is the one
that sends you to Hell?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Oh, you’re a piece of art, Johns. They
oughtta hang you in a museum somewhere. Or forget the museum – maybe
they should just hang you.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Awright. You do the girl, I’ll keep the
others off your back.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Aw, don’t tell me you’re growin’
scruples.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Just wonderin’ if we don’t need a bigger
piece of chum.</p>
<p><strong>johns</strong>: Like who, Mr. Chrislam?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Bring the light!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What’re they doing? What’re we –</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Leave the sled, let’s go, go, go!</p>
<p><strong>fight scene</strong>: Johns’ light hits the ground, creating
an arena of illumination. FAST CLICKING nearby. Still struggling,
Riddick and Johns somehow manage to gang-aim the shotgun and BLAST
THE</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Gotta stay in the light, Johns. That’s the
only rule.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Remember that moment?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Shoulda never took the chains off, Johns.
You were one brave fuck, before. Now look at you. Oh, yeah, you were
Billy Bad-ass with your gauge…with your chains….</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: With Johns skewered by the armpits,
the predator lifts him off the ground and “stares” with a deceptively
gentle</p>
<p><strong>predator’s pov</strong>: Of Johns’ final expression.</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: The predator rears back its head –
then slams forward, hitting Johns with the full force of its
skull-blade, splitting him in two.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Back to the ship, huh?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Get out of our way.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: So everybody huddles together till the
lights burn out? Until you can’t see what’s eating you? That the big
plan?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Where’s Mr. Johns?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Which half?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: You mean….</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Gonna lose everybody out here….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: He died fast. And if we got any choice,
that’s the way we should all go out. Don’t you cry for Johns. Don’t you
dare.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: How many you see?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: One or two.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Audrey?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Three full bottles. But almost time to
refill.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Doesn’t seem like enough to turn back on, does
it?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Only see one way. Turn the sled over and
drag it like that, girl down low. Light up everything we got – and run
through like dogs on fire.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: The sled as a shield….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: And what about the cells?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: I’ll take those.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: We’re just here to carry your light, aren’t we?
Just the torch-bearers.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Let’s drop back an’ boot up.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: What’re you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Blessing you like the others. It’s
painless.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: And pointless.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: I see. Well, even if you don’t believe in God,
it doesn’t mean He won’t be –</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: You don’t see.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: ’Cuz you don’t spend half your life in
lock-down with a horse-bit in your mouth and not believe. And you surely
don’t start out in a liquor store trash bin with an umbilical cord
wrapped around your neck and not believe. Oh, absolutely I believe in
God. And I absolutely hate the fucker.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: He will be with us. Nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Give my blessing to the girl. She needs a
spare.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: As fast as you can.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You sure you can keep –</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: As fast as you can.</p>
<p><strong>slew of shots</strong>: Fry and Imam on the move, dragging
the shield fast. Audrey speed-crawling beneath. Pilgrim #1 tripping
along behind the shield. And Riddick behind them all, face already
tortured, pulling 200 pounds of stubborn-mule cargo – yet somehow
keeping pace. The torch flames, stretched by the wind, flank them in
fire.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Don’t look.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Do not look up.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep
going!</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: “So dark the clouds around my way But through
the darkness I believe I gladly place my hand in His when And, closing
my weary eyes, lean</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Riddick? RIDDICK?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: It’s a fucking staircase! Go over it!</p>
<p><strong>predators’ pov</strong>: Rapid-fire images of Audrey. Flashes
from 10 different predators.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Audrey!</p>
<p><strong>predator’s pov</strong>: Of Riddick’s face.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Didn’t know who he was fuckin’ with.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Suleiman!</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Get the girl back under. Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Oh, no. No, no, no….</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Rain.</p>
<p><strong>rain montage</strong>: Water rilling, running, flowing over
rocks and ground.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: So where the hell’s God now, huh? I’ll tell
you where! He’s up there</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Riddick? How close?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Tell me the settlement is right there!</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: We can’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Here…hide here….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Inside…inside….</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Why’s he still out there?</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Of the settlement.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: He’s not coming back, is he?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: There’s light in here.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Larva….</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Glow worms….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: How many bottles we got? Empty ones?</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: More, more, we need more….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Strong survival instinct. Admire that in a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You’re not leaving. Not until we go back for
the others.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I promised them we’d go back with more light.
And that’s exactly what we’re gonna do..</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Think you’ve mistaken me for somebody who
gives a fuck.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: What, you’re afraid?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Confusin’ me with Johns now – fear was his
monkey. I only deal in life and death. All that stuff in between? Some
shade of grey my eyes don’t see.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I trusted you, Riddick. Goddamn, I trusted that
some part of you wanted to rejoin the human race.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Truthfully? I wouldn’t know how.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Then wait for me. I’ll go back myself. Just
give me more light for them.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Just come with me!</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Got a better idea. Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: They’re already dead. Get on board.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: You’re fuckin’ with me. I know you are.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: ’Course I am – but doesn’t mean I won’t
leave you here. If you believe anything about me, better be that.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: No, you see, I promised them…I have to…I have
to go and….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Step aboard, Carolyn.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I can’t….I can’t….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Here. Make it easy on you.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Don’t do this to me….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Just give me your hand.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: But they…they could still be….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: No one’s gonna blame you. C’mon. Take my
hand and save yourself, Carolyn.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I will not give up on them! I Will not leave
anyone on this rock with those fucking things, even if it means –</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: You’d die for them?</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I would try for them.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: You barely know them.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: But I’m human. I know you view that as a
weakness, but I’m sorry – I do feel fear, theirs too. Goddamnit, Riddick
– yes. I would die for them.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: You came for us….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Yeah, yeah – we’re all fuckin’ amazed.
Anyone not ready for this?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Tighter, tighter….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: I don’t hear –</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Water has pooled at the base of the
muddy rise. A predator drinks there.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Doesn’t see us…wait for it to leave….</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Another predator lands to drink. Then
another. Their backs are to us, but the pool is turning into a major
gathering place.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Get behind me.</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Of a half-dozen predators shifting
places at the pool. A slim gap appears.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: When I go, we go. Full-throttle.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Ready…ready….</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: The gap between predators widens into
a passage. A gauntlet within a gauntlet.</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Of a predator turning to “stare” over
its shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>predator’s pov</strong>: Of Riddick bearing down fast.</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: You know the way!</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Of the predators. Regrouping.
Crawling up the rise at us.</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Chasing them.</p>
<p><strong>predator’s pov</strong>: Chasing Riddick.</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Ahead of us, we see Fry, Imam, and
Audrey vanishing around the corner. BREATHING LIKE A RACEHORSE, we
follow in their steps, storming around the same corner. Suddenly a
predator is right there, right in our face.</p>
<p><strong>predator’s pov</strong>: Of Riddick skidding to a stop. He
snaps a look up.</p>
<p><strong>riddick’s pov</strong>: Of another predator perched
gargoyle-like on the building. It SPEED-CLICKS at us.</p>
<p><strong>predator’s pov</strong>: Of Riddick slowly pulling two shivs.
Bracing himself. Ready to blade it out.</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: Captain….</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: It’s me, it’s me, it’s me!</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: C’mon, Riddick – said I’d die for them, not
you.</p>
<p><strong>fry</strong>: Just 10 steps…keep turning, keep turning…that’s
right…others’re already ‘board, waitin’ for us right now…five
steps…c’mon, almost there, Riddick… almost there…we’re almost –</p>
<p><strong>extreme closeups</strong>: Searching each other’s eyes.
Someone just got slashed from behind, slashed bad. But who?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Not for me….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Probably okay to talk to me now.</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Not sure where to go. I was just runnin’
away when this whole thing started. Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Not sure. I was just runnin’ away when this
whole thing….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Might interest you….</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: New Mecca….</p>
<p><strong>riddick</strong>: Think a soul could get lost there? With all
those pilgrim-types?</p>
<p><strong>imam</strong>: It’s more a place where souls are found,
Mr. Riddick.</p>
