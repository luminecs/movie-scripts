<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: I can’t go wading in with my shlong

<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Police! Stay where you are!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Take it easy, Kosalas.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: The kid didn’t dust him. I did.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Him or me, Sarge. The kid saw the whole
thing.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Tell him, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Yeah, that’s how it went down.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Stay here. Take care of your partner.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Call Luis.</p>
<p><strong>kobas</strong>: Get these people back out of here,
wouldja.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Look, it’s no big thing, Kid. A friggin’ dog
and pony show. Some dumb ass questions by dumb ass bureaucrats. “When’s
the last time you were at the range?” Crap like that.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Look. It was a fuckin’ accident. Why can’t
you just be –</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: You born yesterday?! These ain’t cops.
They’ll roast our ass just cause we carry a badge. Both of us. We stick
together on this, kid. We’re partners, right?</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Aw man, don’t do that. You know how much
these things cost?</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Eddie. Scam this. A bait shop. Worms,
minnows. Don’t even need real worms. Storage problem. Got those rubber
ones, you know?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah, what about the winter?</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: We winter in Florida. Rubber neck the beach
bunnies. Aw, look at that. Ruined my brand new fence climbers. Hand made
in Italy.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Oh, fuck, Partida. I’m gonna tell her you
shot me.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: Cusack. You were in charge here?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Does it look like it?</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: And you were a principal in one of the
shootings?</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: OW! A goddamn Dr. Jekyll!</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: Where’s the officer who was involved in the
other shooting?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Third floor rear.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Catch you later, Hopalong.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: You know that, Efren. When your big bad
brother Luis gets the word, your ass is freeze dried and fried.</p>
<p><strong>brennan</strong>: Talk you hemorrhoid!</p>
<p><strong>pompas</strong>: Your mother fucks dogs in the street.</p>
<p><strong>brennan</strong>: You wanna tune-up? Hey Sarge, you know why
a Comacho’s like a cue-ball? Cause the harder you hit ’em, the better
their English gets.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We’re jerking off here.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Let’s cut the shit, Cusack.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: Option 1: you can send em downtown. If
Judge Collins didn’t get laid last night, you can probably get him to
arraign my clients for loitering in their own hallway. He’ll set bail.
I’ll take care of it. Option 2: release them here and now and we’ll call
it a day. Up to you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I like to see you earn your money.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: We come up the back stairs. We start
cleanin’ the hallway when the deceased pops out of a doorway with a 25
automatic. I tell him to drop it, but he’s comin. We had no choice.
Kosalas here saw the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: I was on another doorway…</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: But you saw the action?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: I saw him fall.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: And the kid was armed?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: That’s the way it went down.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: And you saw the weapon?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Yes sir. I saw it in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>o.k.</strong>: Cragie, you’ll be assigned to headquarters
until the hearing –</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Hearing? Who called for a hearing? The
little fuck tried to shoot me in the back!</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: Ms. Partida –</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: That piece of shit!</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: Shut-up, Cragie. Partida has demanded a
formal hearing. You will be under oath so the department will provide
you with a lawyer unless you’ve got your own. An OPS Review Board member
is waiting to talk to you. Doesn’t sound like you got anything to worry
about.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: Kosalas, you work with Cusack until this is
over.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I ain’t got no time to nursmaid a rookie. I
don’t need a partner.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: Your right! You don’t need a partner! You
need a goddamn keeper! Jesus Christ! How do I explain this one upstairs?
We gave you 600 man-hours, you took a month planning the damn thing, and
what have you got to show for it? Nine bodies? A dead informant? One of
my best men shot! For Christ’s sake! You’re going to have me back on a
beat busting perverts in the park.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We got a bigger problem. These Comachos
aren’t gonna take this lying down. The animals are out of the cages.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: Just what I need. A goddman war.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: Keep track of this business with Cragie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: I’ll deal with upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: Just get me some answers, huh.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: …you have the right to remain silent. You
have the right to have an attorney present at all times. Anything you
say may be used against you in a court of law…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m going to have to fix that.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know, it’s kind of interesting. That 16
year old in the hallway with the gun? Partida told me he doesn’t have a
record. The kid’s never been arrested.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Yeah, well, you know, if you read the
papers, cops only shoot honor students. Sole support of the family and
all that.</p>
<p><strong>tower</strong>: …Lear 9 Lima Kilo number 2 for landing – wind
south 20, altimeter two-niner-niner-two…</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Nice fellow this Luis Comacho. Donato says
they call him the Angel-of-Death.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Real sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>molly luna</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Mama!</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Daddy, would you get that!</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Bella.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Keep ’em closed now.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: O.K., open ’em.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Happy birthday, momma.</p>
<p><strong>theresa</strong>: Happy birthday, Molly.</p>
<p><strong>tony luna</strong>: Molly! Pack me a bag! Quick! Ok? C’mon
I’m in a hurry!</p>
<p><strong>molly</strong>: But Tony, why…?</p>
<p><strong>tony luna</strong>: Business! C’mon, move. Do what I tell
you!</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Don’t do it, momma! Make him pack his own
bag.</p>
<p><strong>tony luna</strong>: I ain’t got time to put up with your
bullshit today.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Listen goddammit! It’s momma’s birthday! She
deserves better’n this!</p>
<p><strong>gamiani</strong>: Hey, Tony. What’s shaking? Sorry I’m late.
I got stuck on Wacker. Some spook…</p>
<p><strong>tony luna</strong>: Victor Comacho is alive.</p>
<p><strong>gamiani</strong>: Oh sweet Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: You can’t go now.</p>
<p><strong>tony luna</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>tony luna</strong>: Put someone on the house. And you keep an
eye on her.</p>
<p><strong>gamiani</strong>: You got it, Tony. What about your
uncle?</p>
<p><strong>tony luna</strong>: What Felix don’t know doesn’t hurt
him.</p>
<p><strong>tony luna</strong>: Here. Happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: Bow to your master!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Later, Odell. It’s been a rough one.</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: Y’ tellin me! We all seen it on the</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Odell!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Bow to your master.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hey, Odell. Here, make yourself crazy.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: You look like shit.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thanks, pal.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: They had a shot on the tube of you guys
comin’ out in front of the building. How’s Donato?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Pissed cause he lost a shoe. Luis Comacho is
in town.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: He’ll collect himself some scalps before
this one’s over. Your answering machine is on the fritz again. Some
woman with a fantastic voice was callin’ about comin’ over this weekend
ta help you with somthin’, and then the tape went nuts.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Want somthin’ to drink?</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: Does the Pope shit in the woods? Is a bear
Catholic?</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I hate smart ass kids.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: Gonna get down in the 30’s tonight. Your
pilot light is out.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ve been told that more than once.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: So, who you figure pulled out the rug?
Gypsies? Mob?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Somebody knew what they were doin’. They blew
the top off an anthill.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: I’d figure the Mob but Scalese ain’t that
stupid. Hah! Sombody put the valve in backwards.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Odell! I ain’t calling you again!</p>
<p><strong>odell</strong>: Later, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: There. Heat.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What was the Cubs final score?</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: 8 to 1.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: Machines just don’t like you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Maybe I don’t like machines.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Arretez! Halten Zie! Stop! Do not move! No se
mueve!…</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: …After the gyros are locked, any movement
of the hand controller is duplicated by the ‘Prowler.’</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: This simple control system means that even
semi-skilled employees can operate the unit with a minimum of training.
As they say, “Even a child can operate it.”</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: He’s talking about you, Cusack. Pay
attention. You’re all gonna have to be qualified on this. It’s the
future.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Just what the world needs, another gun
without a brain.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: You’re looking at the perfect cop. The damn
thing follows orders.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I got better things to do than play with
toys.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: If the Commander will pick someone to try
and elude ‘Prowler,’ we can show how our various target acquisition
systems function.</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: Bang. You’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>sanchez</strong>: A war does no good for any of us. It can
only make what is bad worse.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Get them out of here. Fix them up. I want them
to be beautiful for their mother.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: I promise you, my brothers, there will be
blood for blood.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: This is the cop.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: How much did they pay you to set up my
brothers, Pig.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Stay off my streets, asshole. Or I’ll bite
your head off, and shit in your neck.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: You’re meat cop! Dead meat!</p>
<p><strong>flannigan</strong>: Eenie Verona is the gentleman’s name. You
did a hell of a job on him.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I was motivated.</p>
<p><strong>flannigan</strong>: Know him?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He’s a punk. Punk thief. Booster.</p>
<p><strong>flannigan</strong>: Looks like he graduated.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He had a brother-in-law. They were tight.
Served time together. Ganelli…, Gagleone…</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Gamiani.</p>
<p><strong>flannigan</strong>: If I was you, I’d sit on him.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: You figure he’s connected?</p>
<p><strong>flannigan</strong>: Looks like you’re gonna be busy, Cusack.
Uh, you gonna be using those Cubs’ tickets?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: This Ganiani’s a swinger, huh?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He’s just makin’ up for the time he spent in
the joint.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Now what? They selling protection to the
bears?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Relax kid.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: What’s this? Kinda young for that old fart
ain’t she?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Just watch, kid. Learn.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Be back in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Your Papa worries about you.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Get out of here, Lou. Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hold here a second.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Keep with Gamiani.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Bang a few for me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Wanna play ball?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Are you pitching?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Some people say I’ve got a pretty good inside
curve.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I don’t know. You look strictly minor
league.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I make it Eddie-The-Cop.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’ve had a lot of experience with cops?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: All bad.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’ll get slivers.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Hey, what the hell do you think you’re
doing?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I thought you knew all about cops. You don’t
put anything up your nose do you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Diana Luna? You’re Tony Luna’s daughter?</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I don’t know where he is, and I don’t really
give a shit. When are you people going to realize I don’t have anything
to do with my father.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: For when you need a friend.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I’ve got all the friends I want.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: But do you have all the friends you need?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: This is Sergeant Cusack. I want a team to
cover a house on the southwest side. L-U-N-A, Anthony. Yeah. Crazy Tony
Luna. I don’t think he’s around, but if he shows up bring him in.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Catch you later.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Police! Open up!</p>
<p><strong>kobas</strong>: Awright awright hold it.</p>
<p><strong>kobas</strong>: For Christ’s sake! You tryin to get your
partner killed, Jackson?</p>
<p><strong>brennan</strong>: Hey, Mahoney. I want you to help me get
some signatures on this letter for Cragie.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Way to go, partner.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Let’s try the mitts for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Say, partner.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How ya doing, Richie?</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Swinging. How’s this? Two G’s, we get a
sausage and beef stand stand outside Wrigley Field. You pass the beef, I
take the cash. Free games. I got a contact downtown.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: How you gonna watch the game if you’re
hawking sandwiches?</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Never thought of that. TV? Hey, I tell you
about this nurse I met? Talk about physical therapy.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: She’s got this friend just dying to meet
you. Intensive care.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Later, partner.</p>
<p><strong>brennan</strong>: Hey, Cusack. How about taking the gloves
off long enough to sign this for Cragie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: This about the hearing?</p>
<p><strong>brennan</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I pass.</p>
<p><strong>brennan</strong>: What the fuck’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He’s burnt, Brennan, and you know it. He was
a good cop, but he ain’t now.</p>
<p><strong>brennan</strong>: Get off your high horse, Cusack. He made a
couple of mistakes, OK. The guy was a hero. What the fuck does a bunch
of civilians know about comin’ up some shithouse stairway day after day,
scared outta your shorts.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We’re all scared, Brennan. Cragie should have
been off the street a long time ago. He’s gonna hurt somebody else with
his bullshit. Maybe even you.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: The funeral director says they plan on
cruisin right past luna’s house.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: They’re wastin’ the show. Tony’s not even
in town.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He’ll get the word.</p>
<p><strong>luna</strong>: What the fuck are you talkin about? Nobody’s
gonna touch nothin. Just stay put. I give a shit about their fuckin
parade?</p>
<p><strong>luna</strong>: They wanna throw flowers we can fix it so
they’re pushing up daisys.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: I can back you up.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Stay by the radio.</p>
<p><strong>rocco</strong>: What the hell you doin’ here? Off,
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: The modern age’s answer to the crystal
ball. Marvelous. If you know how to read it. Listen. If you have some
extra cash, buy oranges. The price is low, and I can promise you the
threatened trucking strike will be avoided.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: We talking about a bribe, Scalese?</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: It’s a prediction.</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: No. I wouldn’t try to bribe Eddie
Cusack.</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: You’re incorruptible. Untarnished. I hear
they call you stainless steel on the street. Me, I think you’re a
fuckin’ pain in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: It’s not a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’m looking for your nephew.</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: Tony? Forget it. Tony Luna’s none of your
business.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Wrong. Tony just made himself my
business.</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: No he didn’t. We take care of our own. Just
like the cops. Just like the Comachos. You understand.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: He shit on my turf, old man. And I’m going to
nail him and anybody else tied to him. You understand, Felix?</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: Nobody threatens Felix Scalese.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It’s not a threat. It’s a prediction.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: There’s a shitstorm coming. You better get
yourself a good umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: Tony Luna’s bagman.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: They call that a Columbian necktie.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: They found the manager of Tony’s restaurant
hanging from a hook in his kitchen. Looked like someone tried to carve a
canoe out of him. Tony’s used car lot on Ashland is burning as we speak.
The head salesman is a fried zuccini.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Oh Jesus. It’s starting.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Music’s at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Was there a girl? Late teens. Reddish
hair.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: Two male caucasians, two female. One
mid-to-late forties. The other a grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>pompas</strong>: Come on, Chika. We gonna have some fun. You
gonna take us to your father.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Pompas, you’re getting to be a fucking pain
in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Let her go, pooch.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Another step, and I take her head off.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You don’t have the balls.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Downtown first. Then I’m gonna place you in
protective custody.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: The hell you are!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’ll be safe –</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: I’ll take my chances.</p>

<p><strong>note</strong>: Radio newscast describing the Luna killings

<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: Keep your goddamn pants on!</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: This your idea of a social call?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Fred Pirelli, this is Diana. Diana Luna.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: C’mon, kid. Let’s get you off your
feet.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Can you put her up till I find her old
man?</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: Does a bear…?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Am I putting you on the spot?</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: I spent 30 years on the spot. What ever you
need.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Eddie?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll be right across the hall. I’m just gonna
clean up.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Say, Eddie. Why don’ you come by and tip a
few? Cause I gotta talk to you. Yeah, I know. But we gotta talk. Please.
Yeah, at Mike’s.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: You oughta crash, man. You had a helluva
day.</p>
<p><strong>first hood</strong>: Love it, Flash. Gonna be a slide. Easy
in, easy out.</p>
<p><strong>second hood</strong>: Just a quick and dirty?</p>
<p><strong>first hood</strong>: Yeah, yeah, nothin to it. You know the
drill.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: He picks her up on Forty-third, and he’s
takin’ in. She says, “Say, baby. Ain’t no need for goin’ downtown.” An’
she pulls back her skirt. So the dumb shit climbs in the back an’ takes
a piece… …an’ leaves the keys in the front and locks the two of ‘em in
the squad. And he hasta kick out the window see, an’ she starts
screamin’, “Rape! Rape!” An’ they charge him with rape an’ every other
fuckin’ thing in the book. Internal Affairs is gonna give him a kayak
and a lantern an’ put him out in the lake.</p>
<p><strong>second hood</strong>: Bartender. Gimme a black russian and a
Courvoisier.</p>
<p><strong>first hood</strong>: Yo! Get your hands up motherfuckers.
This is a ho –</p>
<p><strong>second hood</strong>: You stupid motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>second hood</strong>: My old lady tol’ me you was fucked up
in the head. Do I listen? Piece o cake, you say. Snap, you say. Nothin
to it, you say.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Shut up over there.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Eddie! Partner! Meet Ruthie. Dental
Hygienist. She’s oral.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: And this is… Marlene. She works for a
proctologist.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Siddown, partner. I got a proposition for
you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Not now, Donato.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: O.K. O.K. But just let me plant two words in
your brain. Alligator farming.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Beer?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Looks like I’m caught between the rock and
the hard place, Sarge.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: You know I really wanted to be a good cop,
but… shit. It’s hard enough sometimes just to stay alive. Comes so easy
to you. You got all the fuckin’ answers. Me, I’m still tryin’ to find
the questions.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Cragie planted the gun on the kid. Just
wasted him, and then I… I don’t know what to do about the hearing
tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: See. It’s all so nothin’ for you. If I talk
straight every cop on the force will shit on me. If I don’t… Cragie gets
away with murder.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: And the chance to do it again. Next time he
might take away a cop. That make any difference?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: He’s my partner.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Your partner’s selling you out, Kosalas. He
kills an unarmed kid, and now he’s risking your ass to save his own.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: It was a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It cost an innocent kid his life.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: I know that! I KNOW THAT!</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Jesus. I see that kid’s face every time I
close my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Tell ’em like it is, Nick. I’ll back you
up.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Nice to see you out with the boys for a
change, Sarge.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Hello, Cragie.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: They tell me my Sergeant wouldn’t sign for
me. You want to tell me why?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You know why.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: No. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You were a good cop for a lot of years.
You’ve passed your limit now Cragie.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Fuck you. Where do you get off?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Right about here.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: She’s havin’ a bad night. Gave her a shot
of brandy. Maybe she’ll sleep.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Giving liquor to a minor, Pirelli?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I’ll be back right after the hearing
tomorrow, and you can get some sleep then.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: What do you do when you don’t have
anyone?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You find someone.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: Could you… Hold me for a while?</p>
<p><strong>male panel member</strong>: How far were you standing from
where your grandson was shot, Mrs. Murillio?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: In the next doorway. Four meters.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: How you doin’, Sarge?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: What’s the score?</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Kid’s grandmother says Cragie threw down the
pistola.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: Officer Cragie has already been sworn.
Officer Cragie, you have heard Mrs. Murillio’s testimony –</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: You have heard her tell this panel that she
saw you lay the gun in her grandson’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: I’m not saying the woman would make this up.
But there’s no way she could have seen anything from where she was
standing in a hallway that dark. Like you said, she’s the boy’s
grandmother.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: If it was dark, Officer, how were you sure
Vega had a gun?</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: We were lucky. There was a glint of light, a
reflection comin off the barrel of the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: You think he’ll get a pass?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You heard it all. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: If the hearing was over I’d have to put my
money on the old lady. But Kosalas’s next. My bet’s on Cragie.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: The kid may surprise you.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: And right after you heard Officer Cragie’s
gun discharge, what did you do then?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: I immediately advanced down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: And what did you see?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: The deceased, Vega, lying on the floor.
Officer Cragie was checking his vital signs.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: What happened then?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: We recovered a .25 calibre automatic from
the teenager’s right hand.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: Did you see that weapon in Vega’s hand
before Officer Cragie fired?</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: No more questions.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: I’d like to now call Sergeant Cusack.</p>
<p><strong>diana</strong>: You made that uniform look good.</p>
<p><strong>pirelli</strong>: That good looking gorilla next to me is
Eddie’s father. Better than good cop. Killed in the line of duty. ’71.
Another cop shot him. An accident.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I can’t comment on that. It was over before I
got there.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: You are his superior officer, are you
not?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Cragie’s in my unit, yes.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: Did you give the men their various
assignments?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: Did you request that officer Cragie be on
your TAC team?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: Sergeant… I have here a department document
dated 24 September, of last year. It is a request by you, to your
superiors, to have Officer Cragie transferred to another unit. Are you
familiar with this document?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: Why did you request his transfer?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Maybe 30 years is too long for anyone to look
at the city’s guts, Mr. Partida.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: What happened to this request?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: It was denied.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: This is a letter of support for Officer
Cragie. Everyone in his unit signed it but you. Why?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I don’t agree with what it says.</p>
<p><strong>partida</strong>: Are you saying you do not believe Officer
Cragie is fit to work the streets of Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: That’s what I’m saying.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: I just dialed 348-6610, and I get this funny
buzz. Check the line for me? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>brennan</strong>: Seems to me the man’s got his tongue stuck
to his asshole, Cragie.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Hey, that don’t bother him. He’s the fuckin
White Knight. You wanna take on the whole world by yourself? Now you’re
gonna get your chance, Sarge.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: Sorry, sir, that number seems to be out of
service. I’ve reported it.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: He was a friend of yours wasn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Squad, this is 1462. I need a backup. Have 64
and 63 from TAC 4 meet me at the billiard parlor on 18th near Halsted.
Questioning suspects.</p>
<p><strong>dispatch</strong>: 1463 and 1464, Unit 1462 requesting

you.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Where is Luis?</p>
<p><strong>degas</strong>: Get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: Talk to me, Degas, or I’ll hit you with so
many lefts you’re gonna beg for a right.</p>
<p><strong>degas</strong>: He’s coming here. He’s on his way.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: We need a verification on a back-up for
Unit 1462…</p>
<p><strong>second dispatcher</strong>: 1462. That’s Cusack, right?</p>
<p><strong>second dispatcher</strong>: Good luck finding a backup for

<p><strong>luis</strong>: Take him apart.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: …request verification for backup for

<p><strong>officer</strong>: Squad. 47. We’re having vehicular problems.
Not able to respond.</p>

<p><strong>cop</strong>: Fuck him.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: The sun comes up. You give me Luna, or the
girl dies – slow.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: I would have been here, Sarge. They kept it
from me.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You’re Ok, Hopalong.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: Listen, I’m havin’ a drink with this friend
of mine, name of Mickie. She works on a computer over in the Federal
Building, FBI. I got here as soon as I heard.</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: They got Diana Luna.</p>
<p><strong>donato</strong>: That’s what I’m tryin’ to tell ya. Mickie

ten tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tony luna</strong>: Hello, Felix.</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: Hello, Tony.</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: You see, Tony. You make no sense. You start
a war… Waste people… Money… You’re like a kid, Tony. You’re a bad
boy.</p>
<p><strong>scalese</strong>: This sonovabitch is crazy!</p>
<p><strong>eddie</strong>: You tell Luis I got Tony Luna for him. Get me
a time and place.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Your cop friend is smart. Too smart and he
dies. Then I take care of you personally.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: What the hell is goin on?</p>
<p><strong>brennan</strong>: Cusack made off with a truckload of
armour.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: He’s a fucking one man army now.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: What’d I tell ya. The sonofabitch is
crazy.</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: OK, everybody. No more games. Where’s
Cusack.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: I can’t swallow this shit! Eddie Cusack’s
out there takin’ on the world by himself. And you fuckin’ heros are
gonna sit on your goddamn asses!</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: Cool it kid.</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: Don’t you fuckin’ tell me to cool it. I
won’t cool it. I’m not going to fuckin’ lie for you any more. I lied,
Commander. He laid a gun on that kid. I saw the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>cragie</strong>: You little fuckin’ bastard!</p>
<p><strong>kosalas</strong>: What’s this for partner? Your next fuck
up?</p>
<p><strong>kates</strong>: Get someone in the air. We’re gonna find
Cusack.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Take off the gag. I want them to hear her.</p>

<p><strong>luis</strong>: Now! Do it now! Kill her!</p>
