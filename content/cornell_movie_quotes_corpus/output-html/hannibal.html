<p><strong>starling</strong>: …spend some time on the streets. Ask me

street.</p>
<p><strong>krendler</strong>: What is that supposed to mean…?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I think its meaning is clear.</p>
<p><strong>krendler</strong>: What, you’re saying she was
overwrought.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: That could be.</p>
<p><strong>krendler</strong>: Because that’s understandable, because.
She blew the raid.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: She was there, alone, sir, she was in a
burning building, waiting for your folks to come through the wall.
And…</p>
<p><strong>krendler</strong>: One moment, I’m not done with you…</p>
<p>****: Give him the file…</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: I thought it was going to go down the line,
to….</p>
<p><strong>krendler</strong>: No, no, no, I want the girl to do it…</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Of the apprehension of Hannibal Lechter. Here
we have a WANTED poster…</p>
<p>****: Offered by an Unnamed Source, Three million Dollars for
information leading to the apprehension of Hannibal Lechter. It is, of
course, a bounty poster, the only one of its kind, it was never
distributed, the contact number was disconnected, and the trail of the
person offering the reward was covered so skillfully, that…</p>
<p>****: …would you be so kind…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>****: ….Of the Hannibal Lechter Case. Lechter is, as you know, still
at large. Here we see the implements used in his escape from Prison. If
you will turn to your course syllabus, Page….</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: ….a lovely perfume…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Glad you like it.</p>
<p>****: ….of Dr. Lechter’s left hand. His left hand, which had a sixth,
vestigial, fully formed sixth finger. You would think that a man with a
mark so easily identifiable, would…</p>
<p>****: Oh, and to complete your Course of ..Study, by…</p>
<p>****: Your girl’s a menace. Here, givver this… Getter off the street
and teach her some humility.</p>
<p>****: I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>krendler</strong>: Well, then, you have insufficient
information. I’m grateful for this opportunity to set you straight.</p>
<p>****: Yeah, get on to your sea-daddy, Starling. Old as you are… ain’t
you ashamed, still lookin’ for your Pappy…?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: …what has he got against you?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Why would you say that? Because he sent me
in there to be killed…?</p>
<p>****: What is this…?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: …what’s he got against you?</p>
<p>****: He once made me an improper suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: Big man, little man… Fair fight, the good
Big Man’s gonna win. But we don’t mean to send you out there to fight
fair…</p>
<p>****: Big man, now, he’s just a bigger target. Let’s turn it around.
Pull your sidearm.</p>
<p>****: Now, an arrest? You aim to shoot me, or you just playing show
and tell. You don’t want to shoot me, you just deprived yourself of one
of your hands. You fool, I got two hands, you got one. So: what’s the
gun good for? Force? No. It’s good for control. You can control through
force, but you can also control through….</p>
<p>****: Misdirection, My Friend. You’re pointing a gun at me, looking
in the oth’direction, WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK</p>
<p>****: ..that you went into police work to control your rage….</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Well, that would be a poor choice,
wouldn’t it…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Tell me why…?</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be impolite. Because, you know, you
can’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Then tell me.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Well, you know, you know, you know, the
point is: I can’t tell you. Cause you haven’t been there. You haven’t
done it. And that’s all there is.</p>
<p>****: …and to have done it, means, can mean to accept, not only
danger, but betrayal…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: ….that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: ..and humiliation? What is this new
job they’ve…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No. That’s right. That’s all part of
it.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Then, that being so, why is today
special? Why have you come back to see me? Is it that new file they gave
you?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Then what brings you back?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I don’t know. Do you know…?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Yes. I think I do.</p>
<p>****: I think it is a phrase you used with that woman. You told her
you were an orphan.</p>
<p>****: You used, to your mind, your most private fears.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …no…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: …you called up memories of your father
to…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …no…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: …barter with her. To appeal to her,
and you feel that…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No, I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: It is you who have betrayed…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …no.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Your father. It is not they, who…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Well, no…</p>
<p>****: That’s… I appreciate your help, but…</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: You want another drink, honey…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I want the same drink. Cause it did me
good… but I already drunk it, so, barring that, yes, I would like
another.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: What’s that, Baby?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Alcohol. Where both its life-enhancing And
its life destroying qualities…</p>
<p>****: …not unlike some Hindu God…</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: I guess the only thing is Suck it Up…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Well. Excellent… I’m…</p>
<p><strong>foreign cop</strong>: Semper Fi.</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: …truer words were never spoken…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Our Mister Frendler to, to, to humiliate
me, though….</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: What else’s he goin to do with his day, he
can’t work, and he won’t steal…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Oh baby, oh baby….</p>

day, our gallant International Neighbors…?</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Look what they put her on…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No, that is code-word material, that’s
what that is….</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: They got her cleaning out the privvies.</p>
<p>****: What does this mean?</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Slap her wrist, they got her, chasing down the
auction houses, drawings of Mr.Lechter, come up for sale.</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: Why’s she chasing’em down…?</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Find out: is he selling’em, he needs the
money, o’r’izzey buying them, f’Old Times sake…</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: That’s weak. The man’s long gone, he’s not
coming back, buy up a drawing…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No, but that is the Will of the
Institution. To instill a proper Probity, Humility, deference, in the
prideful Individual…..COULD I, DOES</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This Jackal Krendler, trine a shame her, cause
they botched the raid.</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: Evelda Drumgo.</p>
<p>****: N’I don’t care, you see, what all they got me doin, for I’d
rather be doin’ makework, than be doin’ pub’l’relations with THE DIRTY
DOZEN, one Hispanic, one Librarian, one Jew, and One from Column A, and
One from Column…</p>
<p>****: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: An Honor. Carlo Pazzi….</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No, y’know, I never doubted it…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: You were kind enough, today, to take my
photograph.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Well, that’s you see, what I am, kind and
feeling.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: You should get Married.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: That’s what I should do. Tell me why?</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Because, baby, you’re looking to find love in
an institution, that’s your only chance….</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yeah, but who would marry friendless
me…</p>
<p>****: Howabout you, Romeo…?</p>
<p>****: …sadly…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Hey, lost again.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: But perhaps, there is some, some less radical
solution.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I’m sure there is, but my young Friend
here, would kill you.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: His feelings do him honor. And I have come,
simply, to pay my respects to the great Clarice Starling…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: The great and beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Is it necessary to say of the sea that it is
salt, that the stars are far, that…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No,I get it, this is my Cavalier. This
gents my Italian Knight. Take this…</p>
<p>****: For this shall be my gage, and you can take it into battle.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Or clear your windshield with it.</p>
<p>****: …what a lovely perfume.</p>

Alexandria Virginia, n’that’s where I’m going, cause I’m goin home, f’i

<p><strong>brigham</strong>: C’mon, pal.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: All y’got to do is ask…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …this one is my favorite. It has not
title. They should call it “fetch,” whaddaya think…?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I know it well.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Do you. What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: It is a gravestone in the cemetery of ______
in my native Florence.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Yeah, we got all sort of “funeray Sculpture,”
here, I guess they mean statues in Graveyards. Brazil, the Tomb of Karl
Marx, London, Here’s one in Scandinavia…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Florence, as you may not know, is famed
for…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yeah, I’m sure it’s famed for lotsa
things, and you’re one’a’them…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …but: this particular statue…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Waal, you hold fast to that thought, as
I’m sure, that’s a “clue”…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: ….this is perhaps an inappropriate time… but,
I would like to say, it is an honor to meet the Woman who solved the
celebrated Hannibal Lechter…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I din’t solve it, I didn’t ‘solve it’. I

<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Yeah, well, it’s a raw wound, innit, you’re
gonna bump it, every time you turn around… but you know what the trick

<p><strong>starling</strong>: I feel…</p>
<p>****: I feel they’re Out to Get Me…</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: And who is “they?”</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …they’re sending me. Out to get Shot.
Hounding me…. they’re…</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: …the whole world’s out to get you…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: How crazy is that.</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: Well, you wanna shoot back, it give you a
big target…</p>
<p>****: How crazy is that….</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Special Agent Clarice Starling, to see
Mason Verger.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Agent Starling, would you come with
me…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: The children…?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …they’re from Baltimore….</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I’ve never heard that he…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: It’s not something he wants to publicize,
Ma’am. It’s just something he does.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I won’t take much of his time.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: He’s glad to help. …it’s just a question of
his physical condition. You Understand…</p>
<p>****: Five minutes…</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Aren’t they beautiful, Miss Starling…</p>
<p>****: He think’s he’s hurt his knee–but the assurance, the assurance,
the assurance that someone cares Suggests the hurt was elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Mr. Verger, thank you for your time.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: For the worst hurt, of course, that which
will not heal, is the conviction no one cares.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I’ve come to see you, sir, about an
Auction…</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Ah, yes, ah yes. Our Doctor Lechter… And
have they sent you, once again to capture him? How terrible for you…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No, sir, it’s not my job to capt… why do
you say how terrible?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Because we must leave the past in the
past.</p>
<p>****: Ah. And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with
him…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Sir, various drawings, done by
Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape,
have surfaced and are being sold at auction. Several large reserve bids
have been placed on them. I have to ask if you’ve placed those bids.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Because?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Because if it was not you, then, perhaps
it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: And why would you suspect me, of this
ghoulishness?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Because, sir, you are the only one of his
victims who lived. And because you have large resources.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to
devote elsewhere….</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Due respect, sir…</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: My encounter.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Someone offered three million dollars
bounty on Dr. Lechter’s head.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: The identity of the person offering the
bounty was never established.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell
you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true. I offered the bounty. It
was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. And I thank God every day that I
did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder. Do you Agent
Starling: do you know God?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …sir…?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Isn’t it funny? You can look on my face
which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what
I hope is a long life. You can look at me. Which shows a Strength which
must come from strong strong convictions. But you shy when I say the
name of God.</p>
<p>****: …I’m sorry..</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yes, then, you’re saying that you haven’t
bid upon these drawings.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: I have not, I would not. For life life goes
on Starling. And, wait, wait, I wish to talk to you… I’m… One moment. I
was afflicted, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with
your Dr. Lechter. I was afflicted before. Before. Do you see? In my
arrogance. Do not Do not curse God when you are humiliated. Listen to
me: embrace it, and you embrace life…. Listen, and you hear the word of
God…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …will he be alright…?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Mr. Verger wanted me to give you this…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: What would that be?</p>
<p>****: He… would consider it a favor if he could make a donation. To a
charitable institution of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Now, why in the world would he do
that?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: I… think… he was…. he was touched, by your
reaction. To his appearance.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: What reaction?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p>****: Please, I do not… I don’t want to trouble him. But if you or he
have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter’s…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Do you know the seller?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: We’ve subpoenaed the Auction House’s
records.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Try Barney Clark.</p>
<p>****: He is…?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter’s
stay in Prison.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: And how would you know that?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Before “The Change,” Mr. Verger was… he
made quite a study.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: You should get the kids a dog…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: ….I hardly think so… after “The
Incident”…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No, no, of course not.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a
contribution, to the charitable…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Tell him to give it to an orphanage.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: …that you could ~go beyond the
institution.”</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p>****: I saw a man today, a man so hideously deformed who’ll spend his
life in a hospital bbb…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Yes, so you said. But what does that
mean: to go beyond The Institution.</p>
<p>****: If he could overcome… his need for… for self-ratification…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: …would you use a small word?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: For approval.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: What’s wrong with approval?</p>
<p>****: You admired that man.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: How do you think that made him
feel?</p>
<p>****: What does that mean, “to go beyond the institution…?”</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I told that woman I’m an orphan.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: …you are an orphan.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: But… but….but…. you’re right. I used it.
To bargain. For her sympathy… I used it–to “whore myself out”–</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Welcome to the human race.</p>
<p>****: Do you know, there are people who admire you? Reasonable
people.</p>
<p>****: Why don’t you find them…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Y’see John Brigham…?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Look at this:</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: You seen John Brigham…?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: This just came in, over the transom.
Fella, works for a Plastic Surgeon, Argentina. Look here:</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …what’m I looking at…?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: A fellow with five fingers.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …standard issue…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Not for our Doctor Lechter. This…</p>
<p>****: Purports to be an x-ray of the hand of a …white
male…mmmm….mmmm…., after the removal of a vestigial sixth digit. Left
Hand. It purports to be the x-ray of Dr. L…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Am I on that case, sir…?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Well, then–I wouldn’t want to be taken for
a hobbyist…</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Agent Brigham is in the Library.</p>
<p>****: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: This isn’t signed.</p>
<p>****: Hard up as you are, at your age? Whadda you care?
Surrender.</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: ~Don’t shoot, G-Men…”</p>
<p>****: You know what, he’s right. Fella: had his life taken from him,
by a maniac. Fella. He’s laying there, he’ll never get off that bed. He
can’t move, a Monster…</p>
<p>****: …a monster fed his face to the dogs.</p>
<p>****: N’he said that it saved his life.</p>
<p>****: He’s spend’n his life helping Children. How corny is that…?
But, you know what: I give up. Let’s get married and spoil a buncha
Kids…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Starling: They got a x-ray. They think, they
might have a lead on Lechter.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Wherever he is, that’s fine with me…</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: They…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yeah, I know.</p>
<p>****: They got a Radiologist Assistant, Buenos Aires, guy, amputation
of a Sixth Finger…and it seems to’ve left a scar, uh oh….</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: That ain’t my case. They assigned me, go
do some legwork, Theft of Government Property. Tha’s what I’m gonna do,
and then go home and burn the roast. How the hell about that–I’m gonna
swim with the current, and I don’t care where he is.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: ….is that the way for a Public Official
to act?</p>
<p>****: You represent Italy. Call it an inspection…</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Shouldn’t that be carried out in
Depth?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …I have to get back to my wife…</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: How was America?</p>
<p>****: Bad coffee, and women with excessive ankles.</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: …nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: What’s up…?</p>
<p>****: Doctore Carlo Fanelli, curator of the Pallazo Capponi, 2 months
missing.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Yeah, so where is he?</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: Somewhere where his family are offering a
thirty grand reward for Information, so on.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: They got that kind of money?</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: Their family owns…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Well, let’s find him…</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: …buya lot of pasta for your wife.</p>
<p><strong>cop two</strong>: She don’t eat pasta, that’s how come she’s
so slim.</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: Heresa file onnaguy, you got a meeting, the
Palazzo Capponi, at four thirty.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I can’t even go home and change…?</p>
<p><strong>cop two</strong>: What’d you bring me…?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: What else did I miss…?</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: Atrocious Torture. Hit of the Season, you
want, I know a guy can get you a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …are they hard to get?</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: Impossible.</p>
<p>****: …what a world.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What’s the rush? What’s the rush…?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Aren’t you glad to see me?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Tell me about your trip… what did you bring
me…?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I brought you my passion and my wish that
this afternoon will be for you an experience of ecstasy…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I can’t think.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …you don’t have to think.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: We have to talk about money…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I’m on the track of a reward, which…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: A reward…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I’m going to tell you later….</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: A reward for what?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Some museum director disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: They’re offering…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: …you haven’t found him yet.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: What is this, a whorehouse, or are you my
wife?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’ve gone off to America, on your
Vacation…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …I was working…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: …please…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I swear to you…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: …and I want to talk to you about your
promotion..</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Yes? My promotion…?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I want to talk to you about your salary.
Because I can’t…</p>
<p>****: I need you, y’understand, I need you…</p>
<p>****: …everybody needs something…</p>
<p>****: Hold up a minute…</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: You spend the afternoon in Bed?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: First things first.</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: You take this much time over
everything?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: That’s why my wife adores me.</p>
<p><strong>cop one</strong>: Carlo Fanelli, Dottore, missing two months.
He was the Director of the Museum. Which, since his absence…</p>
<p><strong>ricci</strong>: Ah, Pazzi. How was America…?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: What’re they on about?</p>
<p><strong>ricci</strong>: They’re grilling the applicant for the Vacant
Post.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Speaking of the Vacant Post.</p>
<p><strong>ricci</strong>: Dottore Fanelli…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: He hasn’t, by any chance, wandered back in?</p>
<p><strong>sogliato</strong>: Now: our applicant holds in his hand, in
his Non-Italian-Hand, a note, from Dante Aligheri himself. Would he
recognize it, I think not…</p>
<p><strong>another old man</strong>: You want the job for your
nephew.</p>
<p><strong>sogliato</strong>: Indeed I do. Because he is my Nephew?
No. Because he….</p>
<p><strong>a third old man</strong>: Let him read the note…</p>
<p><strong>sogliato</strong>: Yes, fine, of course he can read the note.
His Italian is admirable, for a straniero. But is he familiar with…</p>
<p>****: The personalities of pre-Renaissance Florence? I think not.</p>
<p>****: …a Dr. Fell. A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli’s
post.</p>
<p>****: Brazilian.</p>
<p><strong>ricci</strong>: It would seem.</p>
<p>****: What if he came upon a note in, the Capponi Library, this great
Italian Institution, which he now graces us with his bid to Direct, a
note from Guido de Cavalcanti. Would he recognize it, I think not.</p>
<p>****: Would you care to address that, Dr. Fell…?</p>
<p><strong>dr. fell</strong>: Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante’s
first sonnet. Do you know it, Professor Sogliato? I believe it’s worth
your time: Listen to the way he makes an instrument of the Italian
vernacular, which he called the vulgari eloquentia– the eloquent voice
of the people: Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core in mano, e ne la
braccia avea/Madonna involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la svegliava a
d’esto ardeno/Lei paventosa umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea
paingendo. If Dante had written to a Cavalcanti, it would, of course,
have been to Andrea, the most literary of his brothers….</p>
<p><strong>sogliato</strong>: …why do you want this job?</p>
<p><strong>dr. fell</strong>: In the hope, that someday, I should come
across such a note. I thank you gentleman for your kind attention, and
hope you will consider…</p>
<p><strong>ricci</strong>: …investigating the disappearance of Dottore
Fanelli…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Who, can you think, who would want to harm
Dr. Fanelli, did he have any enemies, that…</p>
<p><strong>committee member</strong>: …I have never met a man who was so
well beloved.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …he was wealthy…</p>
<p><strong>committee member</strong>: He had nothing. He lived in a
garret. His work was his life, he…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …his family has offered a large reward.</p>
<p><strong>committee member</strong>: His older brother offers the
reward, Fanelli had nothing, he….</p>
<p><strong>dr. fell</strong>: …you are most kind…</p>
<p><strong>committee member</strong>: ..who would benefit from his
disappearance? No one. No one has but lost by it…</p>
<p>****: …would you excuse me…?</p>
<p><strong>ricci</strong>: …will have to face the Studiolo, in their
meeting next week. And I, for one, wish you the best.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Dottore…</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Of course, Commendatore…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Could you tell me: did you ever meet your
predecessor, Dottore Fanelli…?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: I never met him. I knew him only from his
writings.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I know that the officers who first
investigated his disappearance searched for a note, a farewell note, a
suicide note…</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: …yes.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: You have taken over his offices, is that not
so?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: It is only temporary, until my confirmation
by…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Of course, in his offices, if you come across
anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would
you contact me, please… Are his personal effects still at the
Palazzo?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Yes. Packed and with an inventory.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I’ll have them picked up.</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Thank you, I am most happy to walk in this
most magnificent of cities.</p>
<p><strong>fell’s left hand, has a scar on the back in the shape of
a</strong>: 3.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: May I ask you a personal question,
Dr. Fell?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: If your duty requires it.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: You have a recent scar on the back of your
hand.</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: And you have a new wedding ring on yours? La
Vita Nuova?–</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: You looked oddly at me, back on the
landing.</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it
hard? Must one, then, be constantly suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Why did you look at me that way?</p>
<p>****: I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but clean. Just dressed–in
the middle of the…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …please…</p>
<p>****: I saw a man, somewhat fatigued. Quickly dressed, a bit
dishevelled. In the middle of the day.</p>
<p>****: An old story. And then I saw the clothing was fresh–therefore:
a man who dressed at home. And then I remarked the new wedding ring. And
so: the story gave me pause. A lovely story. A new, and a beloved wife.
I wish you joy.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: You assemble this, on the instant, from these
few observations?</p>
<p>****: I’m a historian. It is our task to assemble the seemingly
unconnected into the obvious.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …your scar..?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: My scar is a war-wound.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Carpal-tunnel syndrome. From a life of typing.
Commendatore. History, a hazardous profession.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Yes. How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: You resemble a figure from the Della Robia
Rondels, in your family’s chapel at Santa Croce.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the
Baptist. You have seen the chapel?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: I have had the honor.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: And? Then?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: I wonder no longer. You were out of the
country.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: How could you know?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: I sense…</p>
<p>****: The faintest whiff of a perfume, whose base, whose base, whose
base is “Hamamelis” … it is witch-hazel–such a clean scent. No, not a
European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World. I would say,
you have been in America. Have I struck home?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: You know America?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: …you have brought this perfume… brought this
perfume. Back. Back from America. To your New Wife…</p>
<p>****: You have given it to her, and some of…</p>
<p>****: Some of ‘her perfume’ has found its way back onto you. Lucky
man. Lucky man, indeed.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Should you come across anything which…</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: You will be the first I call.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Are you attracted by Death?</p>
<p>****: It is the one great mystery, is it not? Anyone who would say
otherwise must be a hypocrite. Don’t you think…?</p>
<p>****: How are you, Agent Starling?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Ah, Barney: you’ve got a good mernory.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You know why that is? Because there are so
few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I
have not been read my rights?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I have not read you your rights.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Would you mind saying that into your
bag…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I hereby acknowledge that…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: And now I have “dociled” you, have I not? By
forcing your obedience.</p>
<p>****: Then why did you chose to inform me of it…?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: To show…</p>
<p>****: in my ability to squander. What one might deem an advantage…
that my strength is greater than yours…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Oh yeah? Wanna arm wrestle…?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: If you’ll come down the street I will make
you a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You almost took down Evelda Drumgo.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Well. Word gets around.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: …what hindered you…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: It wasn’t my day.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Perhaps you did not have the support you
required.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: It’s a poor workman who blames his
tools.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Or, perhaps…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …how are things at the Hospital?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: It’s a growth business.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: What have they got you doing?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Orderly.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I would have figured you an R.N. by now,
or, maybe Med School.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous
professions.</p>
<p>****: You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter’s prison
ward.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Yes, I presumed it was about him.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …you…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I’m struck by your phraseology. I did not
last with him. I was privileged to enjoy his company during that
time.</p>
<p>****: I’m looking for…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: He said, and these were his words, he valued
our time together, because I was civil.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Did you ever think, did you think, after
he escaped, he would come after you?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude.
Or: “natural composting.” Do you think he’d come after you…?</p>
<p>****: What…?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I asked you how you like your coffee…? We
have black and bitter. As the Soul of Man. Or light and sweet, as the
world- view of the self-delusive.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: We got a bunch of materials, coming up at
auction. Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter’s cell, drawings
he made, his books.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: And I’d like your help, determining who’s
bidding for their purchase.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Waal, because your selling’em… Two years
ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for
sixteen thousand dollars. Seller’s affidavit of ownership, signed Cary
Panz. P.A.N.Z. Sounds to me like an Orderly. Whadja clear on the book?
Ten, twelve grand?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: …very good.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Here’s what they want you to do: we want
the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: …why?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Let’s just say they got a passion for
collectibles…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You said “here’s what they want you to do…”
Why?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Now, whyn’t you help us?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: That would adversely impact my income.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Not as much as being jailed for theft of
Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed
income.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: We could skip the Gavotte.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Say it in English.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Lechter’s not buying up his Memorabilia. He
keeps it all in his “mind,” do you see…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Then who’s buying it?</p>
<p>****: There’s one or two freaks, and, for a “Pass,” I’ll rat them out
to you…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: That’s the spirit…</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: …aren’t you afraid of me…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: You want me to be?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: I’d prefer it…</p>
<p>****: But it’s just a vacant exercise.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: A vacant exercise, why…?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: You said “here’s what they want you to do.”
Aren’t you part of them anymore…? Aren’t you part of the FBI? ‘No Girl’s
Allowed,’ or what? Have you transgressed…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Let’s keep it to business, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: …why have they stuck you on this silly
little roust?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …they did it for a lark.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Oh, Good. The ornithological leitmotif…</p>
<p>****: Who are these guys…?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Rich, comic book freaks.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: And why is it a vacant exercise?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Because we both know who’s buying the
Lechteriana.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Who would that be.</p>
<p>****: Mason Verger. For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned
his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice. Can you
be free….?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No, you’re wrong about Verger.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Oh, yes. He’s found Peace.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Well, if he hasn’t, I’m vastly
mistaken.</p>
<p>****: And have you found Peace..?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: What’ll you do with the bird…?</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: Pluck it, and eat it. It was so good to see
you..</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: How you doin?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: M’I gonna see you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Then I’m doing fine.</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: What’s new onna street?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: All Quiet Along the Potomac…</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: His job description? He’s a comic book
freak.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Whadda we want him for…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Insufficient Animation. Just get me his
vital signs, will you…?</p>
<p>****: Catcha later…</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Which would, of necessity, have left
this scar in the shape of the number “3.”</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Why a Three?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: It requires two flaps to close the area
between the…</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Starling: come look at this: did you see
this?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yes sir, I saw it.</p>
<p>****: We have a memo here, from your friend Mr. Krendler at the
Justice Department.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I am all attention.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: He requests your presence, once again, as
part of…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Just the person I’m looking for.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: And why would that be…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Because you’re going to help me plan a
party.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: You’re going to do that?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I’m going to do it, and you’re going to
catch the bouquet.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force: read
alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the
apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo. The man’s hazing you.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: My daddy would say: accept with glee the
things you cannot change.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: I’ll tell you what: I should go in there,
volunteer to fill up his Female Quota.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Mr. Crawford asked my opinion. Here we’ve
got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter’s surgery. Do we keep it secret, or
broadcast it?</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Saying what, “Look out for a guy with ten
fingers…?”</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yeah, that’s too Hip for the Room.</p>
<p>****: You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked,
cowboy stuff, till after you get your mind cleared…. you don’t wanna go
out there a half-step slow…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I don’t wanna go out there at all…</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: What do you want to do? You want to jam up
that sonofabitch Krendler.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No. I want to buy a dog.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: What broke you free, Girl?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater
Than Mine…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: “…and age-appropriate large and small motor
skills. His unfortunate home situation has made it necessary for
Franklin to form immediate attachments with adults, which we understand
to have contributed to many instances of his abuse.”</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Are you Franklin ?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: …Franklin.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: With Mama and Shirley and Stringbean.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: In and out. Yes. And Mama… and Mama, is not
your real Mama, is she Franklin?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: She my foster.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: She’s not the first foster that you’ve had.
Is she?</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Do you like it at your home, Franklin?</p>
<p>****: We got KittyKat…</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Yes…. yes…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: …and Shirly, let me sleep with her
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Yes. Franklin, you can’t live there anymore.
With Mama and Shirly and Kittykat. You have to go away.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: …who say…?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: The government says. Mama has lost her job,
so she can’t be your foster mother. The police found a marijuana
cigarette in your home. You can’t see Mama anymore. Or Shirley. Or Kitty
Cat. That’s what the Government says…</p>
<p>****: Do you know how you keep kittycat from getting a shot?
Franklin? No? Do you know. Then come here…</p>
<p>****: No, I’m fine…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Most current information shows the result
of an operation for the removal of a sixth digit, the left hand of a
man.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Can we identify it as Dr. Lechter?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Not with any certainty we…</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Why did he come back?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Our operatives in Brazil have been
empowered to offer a reward of….</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …are you alright, sir…?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: HE TURNED BACK INTO THE ROOM. Where have we
Seen it Before.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Seen what, sir..?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: The puppy comes back. If you lie on the
ground. The Puppy with return. Why? Do you know why…? TO KILL YOU.
IT</p>
<p><strong>it comes back to tear your throat.</strong>: THAT’S WHY THE
CHILD TURNED BACK. As Lechter will return back. You see? To the sight of
his oppressor wounded. He will return to savage our beloved Miss
Starling. Bring me a drink.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Your drink, sir.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: It’s time to step up the pressure on our
Sweet Miss Starling. …call our friend at the F.B.I. And, instead of
finding Lechter, let’s help Him find us.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …the purpose of the exercise… is it because
they are expensive…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: They aren’t expensive, you got them
through your connections…. speaking of which:</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Fine, thank you, but</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: Speaking of which, I want you also to
get us tickets for the Opera…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …whatever is within my power…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: …and that is what you need to
expand.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p>****: We are here on sufferance. I am here…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …why are we here in the first place…?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: Because it is exclusive… because
everyone will be here…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …my love…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: …they asked us to dinner. How can we
accept if we cannot return the…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I am on the track of…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: Yes, yes, yes, your thirty thousand
dollars reward, which you would have to split with your team, which, if
you get it, will not buy me a new watch…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …what do you expect me to…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: So, the question: as always, Rinaldo,
the question is one of mmm…</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Commendatore would you do me the honor of
introducing me.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Darling, Dr. Fell. My wife Madame Pazzi.</p>
<p>****: Enchante.</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: The exhibit is closing. The exhibit is
closing in Ten Minutes… please make your way to the…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: Dr. Fell. You are not Italian.</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Sadly, no. And I find that birth is one of the
few things in life which study and a pleasant attitude can not amend.
What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: And how do we account for the interest
of such a charming man, an interest in Torture?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Dr. Fell is studying for his examination by
the Studiolo.</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Indeed I am. And the connection, between
Dante, and, in fact, between your illustrious forebears… if you’d come
with me, I could show you…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: But the exhibit is closing.</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: How unfortunate.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: My husband brought it to me from
America.</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: A wonderful country…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: You know it?</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: I have had many excellent meals there.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: And yet, they are not know for their
cuisine.</p>
<p>****: …should love to correct your error.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: Well, perhaps sometime we…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Darling…</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Well, if you will excuse me. Madame. What a
pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: The commissioner is going round the Cafe…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: No. Invite us? No, he simply…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: Then we cannot go.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Because…?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: Because we cannot pay…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: “Because we don’t have any money.”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: ….because we don’t have any mmm…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: The Case that I am working on…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. pazzi</strong>: It’s a joke. You’re a joke. You’re a
joke. You don’t know what money is– your idea of money…</p>
<p>****: …spend it on a whore on your ‘business trip.’ That is the fine
limit of your ambitions…</p>
<p>****: And I want tickets to the Opera.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: What was it.</p>
<p>****: What was it, honey?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …something about my father…?</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: …what?</p>
<p>****: Do you think you could make a cup of coffee, cause I’m going to
work.</p>
<p>****: Show me the pigs.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …may we see it, please?</p>
<p>****: We have them trained the two things: to come on the whistle,
and to attack the figurine.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Do it…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …Let’s see the pigs, please.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: We tape the screams, to get them used to
the</p>
<p><strong>second gentleman</strong>: …distraction.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: …as you recommend,</p>
<p>****: I think they like it. They will eventually.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Make them eat the figurine.</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: They will, sir. We train them, to the
figurine, eventually, they consume a man, say, 80 kilos, say, in…</p>
<p>****: …tell them…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: We don’t want the man consumed. No. We want
to put the man’s feet through the bars, and have the pigs… and have the
pigs eat his feet.</p>
<p>****: …they eat his feet…</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Yes. It’s all a question of bait–isn’t
it…?</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: …they eat the dummy, sir, they eat the
man… I keep them hungry. When… when do we think this man arrives.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Is it necessary to know?</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Well, I don’t want to starve them too
long. They die.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Oh, no, no. It won’t be that long.</p>
<p>****: Please call our friend at the FBI.</p>
<p>****: Hello. Do you know who this is? I think it’s time to finish the
preparation of our friend. Miss Starling. I’m fine, how are you…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …to, to… to be in control of my… my
emotions.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Yes, but no one is in control of their
emotions.</p>
<p>****: that’s all we have time for today…</p>
<p>****: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: You said: that you have “decided.”
That your… your feelings of persecution, as you put it are a “self-
indulgence,” and you are going to put them aside. And get on with your
job.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: And you have decided to accept… to
accept this “emotion,” as you put it, to the … the “sweepings. of the
Lechter case.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: And you’ve decided to get married.</p>
<p>****: You’ve decided a lot of things.</p>
<p>****: But, in spite of your decisions–you are still “nagged” by
feelings of: despair, of failure of… you still have the nightmare,
you…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: What is your point?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: That if decision were a useful tool,
you wouldn’t be here.</p>
<p>****: Why are you here…?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: …yes…?</p>
<p>****: I want to do something positive…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: You want some advice.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Your life has been defined by
institutions. The Orphanage where you were raised, the FBI Academy, the
Bureau. If the Institution is your life, accept it. Ask to be reinstated
on the “Drumgo” task force. Play their game.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …why?</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: Because it’s the game you’ve chosen.
That’s really all we have time for.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …a liaison position…</p>
<p><strong>superior</strong>: And what does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …I feel that…</p>
<p><strong>superior</strong>: “A liaison position with the Opera.”</p>
<p>****: You want me to reach out for tickets to the Opera. Say so. What
is that young girl doing to you…?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Could you get me tickets to the Opera.</p>
<p><strong>superior</strong>: She must be something special After
Dark.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I can’t remember.</p>
<p>****: I’ve got to make some money.</p>
<p>****: Thirty thousand dollars reward. In the whereabouts of Il
Dottore Fanelli, or the apprehension of his…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: …yes, yes, yes….</p>
<p><strong>superior</strong>: The short term problem is the tickets– The
long-term problem is your wife.</p>
<p><strong>colleague</strong>: Naldo, you want Opera Tickets…?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: Can you help me?</p>
<p><strong>colleague</strong>: No, but I’m going. If you like, I’ll tell
you what you missed.</p>
<p><strong>superior</strong>: And the related problem is your job. Aha.
And here it all comes together. To get a promotion you must keep your
job. To keep your job you must solve this case. Solve the case, and the
reward may help you keep your wife. In short, the solution to all your
problems lies in This File: The Disappearance of Il Dottore Fanelli.</p>

<p><strong>cordell</strong>: If you would see him monument, look around
you.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Show me the Pigs.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Telephone call. From Switzerland, sir.</p>
<p><strong>second brigand</strong>: I hit him with the beanbag gun, you
stand by: he’s still flopping…</p>
<p>****: Della vigna was disgraced and blinded for his betrayal of his
emperor’s trust- -through avarice. Avarice and hanging</p>
<p>****: are linked in the ancient and the madeadeval mind.</p>
<p>****: You will be interested in this, Commandatore, as there are two
Pazzi’s already in Dante’s inferno…</p>
<p>****: Camicion de Pazzi, as you know, murdered a kinsman, and rests
in hell awaiting the arrival of a Second Pazzi. But it’s not you: it’s
Carlino, who will rest forever in hell for the crime of Treachery.</p>
<p>****: Avarice, and Hanging, then.</p>
<p>****: On the next occasion, you might like to discuss the matter of
Chewing. Chewing in Dante: Count Ugolino, chewing the back of the
archbishop’s head–Satan, with his three Faces, chewing Judas, Brutus,
and Cassius… all three traitors. Is it not? Thank you all for your kind
attention.</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I’m not a scholar, Dottore. But it seemed as
if they, as if they…</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Yes, I think I amused them. To what do I
owe…?</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I require…</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: …yes, yes, yes…</p>
<p><strong>pazzi</strong>: I’d like to walk home with you, and…</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Yes, of course, and we’ll collect them. I
won’t be a minute…</p>
<p>****: This one will interest you: let me see if I can improve the
focus…</p>
<p><strong>fell</strong>: Can you make it out, can you make out the name
on the plaque?</p>
<p>****: It says Pazzi. Pazzi. And a rude, a very rude poem, this is
your ancestor. Francesco, hanging outside the Palazzio Vecchio. Outside
These Very Windows.</p>
<p>****: If you tell me what I need to know, then it would be convenient
for me to leave without my meal. And Mrs. Pazzi will remain unscathed.
I’ll out the questions to you, and we’ll see: I saw at the theatre you
had betrayed me. And, when the police didn’t come, it was clear you had
sold me out. Was it to Mason Verger? Blink one for yes.</p>
<p>****: Was that a single blink? Yes. Thank you.</p>
<p>****: …would it help if I were to cut your</p>
<p><strong>brigand one</strong>: …cover the backdoor. If he comes out,
Kill him.</p>
<p><strong>brigand two</strong>: …the bonus was for…</p>
<p><strong>brigand one</strong>: Kill him, and cut him.</p>
<p><strong>hannibal</strong>: Young man…</p>
<p>****: Do you think you could help me….?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: …how do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: It’s real funny.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Tell me the good news.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: He escaped…</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Have the child taken to bed.</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: I wanna see more…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: What do you want me to do?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Follow Starling, stake out Starling.
Increase the pressure on Starling. He will come to her.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: And I brought this for you…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: Out of John Brigharn’s Locker…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I know you did what you could.</p>
<p><strong>crawford</strong>: I’m going to work for your
reinstatement…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Reinstatement to what? There ain’t nobody
there…</p>
<p><strong>newsie</strong>: Starling, Agent Starling: what do you have
to say to the New Accusations…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: New…?</p>
<p><strong>newsie</strong>: You’ve been accused of…</p>
<p><strong>second newsie</strong>: Agent Starling: what was your
reaction to your indictment…?</p>
<p><strong>brigham</strong>: …indictment…?</p>
<p><strong>second newsie</strong>: The district attorney today…</p>
<p><strong>travel agent</strong>: Majorca, Greece…. oh, Aaand Turkey….
Mr. Bates, you’re treating yourself to a Holiday you’ll remember
for…</p>
<p><strong>talking head</strong>: Of the American FBI agent, Clarice
Starling, shown here, in her dramatic gun battle, last week, with…</p>
<p><strong>travel agent</strong>: Mr. Bates…? Mr. Bates…?</p>
<p><strong>talking head</strong>: Dismissed from the FBI, she, it seems,
is under criminal indictment for…</p>
<p><strong>hannibal</strong>: Could I, do you believe, change my
Destination…?</p>
<p><strong>travel agent</strong>: Well…well…what did you have in
mind…?</p>
<p>****: …criminal indictment…. in quite a surprising move, against
agent, that is, Former Agent…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …it’s the F.B.I.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Yes. Good. No. He will come. He will come.
Do not let up on our Angel Starling. No. Now you must keep a constant
watch on her. Use your toys–A transmitter in her car, a…. keep her in
your sight… Do not let up, and he will come back for the wounded
bird.</p>
<p>****: He will find a way.</p>
<p><strong>young girl</strong>: Let go, let go, let go.</p>
<p><strong>young mother</strong>: What are you doing to my son? Let him
go!</p>
<p><strong>young mother</strong>: He’s…what is he doing to my SON?</p>
<p><strong>hannibal</strong>: I beg your pardon, Madame, I was replacing
his…</p>
<p>****: I was trying…</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: …he was trying not to wake him.</p>
<p><strong>hannibal</strong>: I beg your pardon, if I caused you any
Consternation.</p>
<p>****: Your mother would disapprove. Of your taking food from a
stranger.</p>
<p>****: Ah. But she’s asleep..</p>
<p>****: And it’s important, as I’m sure she’s said, to Eat New
Things!</p>
<p>****: so important…</p>
<p><strong>man one</strong>: …be easier if we just kill him.</p>
<p><strong>man two</strong>: Be easier on everyone but us…</p>
<p>****: It’s going to be long…?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Mmm. Is it going to work?</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: The problem, if it is: the tape is not
the true scream, an’ the dummy, of course, is not the true man. BUT.
Yes, yes, I think, is close enough….</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: So: the two problems are: they should be
fed, and they should practice on a real…</p>
<p><strong>gentleman</strong>: Yes. You could say, that the two, the two
prob…</p>
<p>****: Sad day.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …what…?</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: N’not that sad.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Every suicide kills two.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Yeah. Well. They’re a talkative buncha
commentators.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: You got a lot of people love you,
Starling.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Trouble is, they all seem to die.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Y’want to gimme Brigham’s pistol?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: What would you guess, Ardelia?</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: You goin to shoot yourself?</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Don’t shoot yourself.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Cause I’m tired, cleaning up after you.</p>
<p>****: Why dontcha gimme the gun?</p>
<p>****: …you brush your hair first…</p>
<p>****: …the dream of your Father.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: He was shot…he was shot. On his rounds.
And… and…</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: That’s when you went to the
Orphanage…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: And all he left us: the Country brought
back his hat, and his badge… both with a bullethole in them. An’ that’s
what he left us. That’s what I said.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: And you have been dreaming… dreaming
about this Hat, and…</p>
<p>****: And. I always said, he was a P’lice officer.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: …yes…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: But. He was a night watchman. That’s what
he was. N’They brought back, his hat, his badge, an his timeclock.</p>
<p>****: N’then they took me off.</p>
<p>****: I saw… I saw. Clear as day, do you, do they call it a delusion?
His hat an his badge. Clear as day, bulletholes and all.</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: But they were not there. Yesterday. Is
that called a Delusion…?</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry. I’ll have to take this in the other room.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …got her staked out. Yeah, she’s still in with

<p><strong>starling</strong>: …who paid you… who…</p>
<p>****: Mapp. Get me Ardelia Mapp. Well. Get in touch with her. Tell
her…</p>
<p><strong>convenience store operator</strong>: …could I see some
I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Tell her that….</p>
<p><strong>convenience store operator</strong>: …you’re really going to
need to show me some identification.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: ..this is Clarice Starling..</p>
<p>****: …this is not a personal message…I…</p>
<p>****: Yaaasss…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …thank you…</p>
<p>****: And how are you this evening, Doctor? No, we know that you’re
awake…</p>
<p>****: Good evening, Dr. Lechter. Thank you for coming. I am sorry
that we could not meet under more pleasant circumstances.</p>
<p>****: But you will recall what the last time we met, you drugged me,
and induced me, in that state, to scrape my face off and</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …the bad news is: we’re going to stick your
feet through those bars tomorrow, and feed them to our pigs.</p>
<p>****: Thank you, Cordell.</p>
<p>****: …but will that satisfy you?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Why should you care?</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: It is not that I care for you–but that I
posses an enquiring mind. What will you do when I am gone? When you have
nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and,
more to the point, stupidity.</p>
<p>****: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: You don’t wish to beg…?</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Would that add to your mirth?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Explain in depth the plan we have for him.
Until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: One would have thought he’d keep me under
observation. To savor his triumph.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: No, I think he proffers to spend his happy
hours with his playmates.</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: …young boys, still…?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …here’s to child abuse!</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Mmm…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …and then, he’ll be coming down.</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: You said the bad news…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: I believe that your tone implied that there
was some good news…. and, do you know… there might be good news for
you…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Oh, yes, what? You’d bribe me, to, to, to,
“release” you…?</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: I can make you rich.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: And I expect you to.</p>
<p>****: Let’s talk like two medical men</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Come on, stay with us. Look here: I could
get behind you, and give you a spinal, tomorrow, you wuunt feel anything
down there, a l’il pulling is all. N’I’ll tell you what, after he’s got
his jollies, ten, f’teen minutes, I’ll come down here, give you a shotta
this</p>
<p>****: stop your heart, an that’s you done, an there’s an end to it.
What do you say…?</p>
<p>****: I know you got lotsa money, evabody says so. I know how that
stuff works, take it out, move it around…</p>
<p>****: …stay with me now, fuss with it… Whatsay we call your banker
now, tell him a code… move that money to me, he confirms it, and I fix
you up Right Now…</p>
<p>****: Whatsay?</p>
<p>****: ..suitcase…locker…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Come on, Doctor, then you can sleep…</p>
<p>****: …unmarked hundreds….</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: ….what…?</p>
<p><strong>man one</strong>: …you wan me to shoot im?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: That’s the last think I want…</p>
<p>****: Our other option is to beat you for a while, with this axe
handle, here. I suppose this is what it feels like.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Oh yes. Oh, yes, come here… Come here…Up
Lad, When the Journey’s Over, they’ll be time enough for Sleep…</p>
<p>****: Make it last, make it last, for godsake, make it last….don’t
“hurt” him…!</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: I’m awake. Oh. Is it Time!</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: ..It won’t be long now, sir…</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: OHFORGODSAKE, get ON with it.</p>
<p>****: On the ground, on the ground…</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Good morning, Clarice.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Can you walk? Are your legs working…?</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Perhaps… shall we see…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I’m going to cut you loose. With all due
respect, Doctor, if you fuck with me, I’ll shoot you dead, do you
understand…? Do right and you’ll live through this.</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Spoken like a Protestant.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: No, I don’t think so.</p>
<p>****: I’m going to subdue our friends, coming down the hill, and I
want you to cuff em, and to put em inside with the other fella… My car
is</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Other fellow? There should have been two of
them…?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: What’s happening, would you please…?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Stop there, would you, please, Doctor…?</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: The girl could use some help.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: You’re free…</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: …which of us is free…?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: Yes, to cease to Hope is the Greatest Crime.
The Greatest crime. Perhaps the only crime. I never ceased to hope!</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: The girl needs help.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: And what would be of Greater Help, than to
release her, from the bonds of this sordid earthly existence. DON’T
YOU</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: …might I make a suggestion…?</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: …after you’ re dead. AND WHEN I GIVE THE
WORD, do you understand…when I give the word…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …fraid, that’s about it, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Let the girl go.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: For a consideration.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: ’fraid it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>verger</strong>: …when I…</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: …what has she done to harm you…?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Yes, do you know, you’re right…</p>
<p>****: …Mr. Verger…?</p>
<p>****: Mr. Verger, Sir? He’s ready…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: He don’t like popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: No. And…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: I like Popcorn…</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: …yes, if you’ll, just step away…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: You give me whatever I want…?</p>
<p><strong>cordell</strong>: Yes. You know I will. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Awright.</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Let me down, son, let me down.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: What’ll you do for me?</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: I’ll take you home.</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Ain’t got no home.</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Then what would you like…?</p>
<p>****: Yes. You shall have it…</p>
<p><strong>franklin</strong>: Then you goin to hell…</p>
<p><strong>hannibal</strong>: …that’s right…</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: You look lovely.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>****: No, I know you’d prefer “I’m glad you find me so…”</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: I’d prefer you to say what you feel.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: What is that that smells so wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: I hope you’ll find it so.</p>
<p>****: Yes. It’s good to see you regaining your strength…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Thanks to you…</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Now, what were we last speaking of…?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: We were speaking of my father…</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: …I’m sorry….?</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …we were speaking of my father…</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Indeed we were.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …and my need for The Institution…</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Freud, do you know…? Freud psychoanalyzed
patients in One Afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: And how did he do that?</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: He saw the truth, and spoke it…</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I’m afraid, this wine is making me
woozy…</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: …you have to eat…</p>
<p>****: You’ve sought out The Institution all your life, as you with it
to replace your Father. This is obvious. Less obvious is this: that you
require the institution not to support you, but to</p>
<p>****: That every man is fallible, that every institution, being made
of men, cannot but be corrupt…</p>
<p>****: :and that is the especial surprise, I’ve prepared for You!</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: I feel weak…</p>
<p>****: …you must eat.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: …1 don’t understand…</p>
<p>****: The gift, of course is not the meal– but the
identification–which of us does not need help? The identity, of your
true enemy…? …for you always sought to befriend, to wish the love of
those who wished you ill.</p>
<p><strong>lechter</strong>: Come here, I’m going to cure you.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Might I have some more of the wine…?</p>
<p>****: This lovely evening, in particular…. it seems to reward me with
clarity…</p>
<p><strong>swat man</strong>: …I’ve got her…</p>
<p>****: …may be the heat….</p>
<p><strong>krendler</strong>: Let’s get her out of here….</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: But as my father used to say…</p>
<p>****: …ohmiGod.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: That’s why it’s a stone, you know, It means
Don’t Come Back.</p>
<p><strong>starling</strong>: Well. No. He can’t come back.</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: Baby, that’s the beginning of wisdom.</p>
<p>****: Give me your gun…</p>
<p><strong>mapp</strong>: …what…?</p>
