<h1 id="ninotchka">ninotchka</h1>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Is there anything I can do for you,
monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Yes, monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Just looking around.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Comrades, why should we lie to each other?
It’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Let’s be honest. Have we anything like it
in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>all three</strong>: No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Can you imagine what the beds would be in a
hotel like that?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: They tell me when you ring once the valet
comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what
happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in – a French maid.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Comrades, if we ring nine times… let’s go
in.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Just a minute – just a minute – I have
nothing against the idea but I still say let’s go back to the Hotel
Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official
mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Where is your courage, Comrade
Buljanoff?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the
barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: I don’t want to go to Siberia.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: I don’t want to go to the Hotel
Terminus.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: If Lenin were alive he would say,
“Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you’re in Paris. Don’t be a
fool. Go in there and ring three times.”</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: He wouldn’t say that. What he would say is
“Buljanoff, you can’t afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn’t the
prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in
a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when
you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey,
Buljanoff!”</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: I still say our place is with the common
people, but who am I to contradict Lenin? Let’s go in.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Are you the manager?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Pardon me for introducing Comrade Iranoff,
member of the Russian Board of Trade.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: This is Comrade Kopalski.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: I am Comrade Buljanoff.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: May I ask how much your rooms are?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Well, gentlemen, I’m afraid our rates are
rather high.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Why should you be afraid?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I might be able to accommodate you. Is
there some more luggage?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big
enough to hold this?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’m afraid we have no boxes of that size in
our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe…</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: That’s even better.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: But, gentlemen, I am afraid…</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: He’s always afraid.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I just wanted to explain. The apartment may
suit your convenience but I doubt that it will fit your convictions.
It’s the Royal Suite.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Royal Suite! Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Now Comrades, I warn you… if it gets out
in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: We’ll just say we had to take it on account
of the safe. That’s a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big
enough.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff and iranoff</strong>: That’s right. Good, very
good.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Of course, we could take out the pieces
and distribute them in three or four boxes in the vault and take a small
room. That’s an idea, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Yes, it’s an idea, but who says we have to
have an idea?</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: That’s right… that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Give us the Royal Suite.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski’s voice</strong>: Will you connect me with Mercier…
yes, the jeweler…</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: I want to speak with Monsieur Mercier
personally… Hello, Monsieur Mercier? This is Kopalski of the Russian
Board of Trade. We arrived this morning… Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski’s voice</strong>: Yes, everything is here. The
necklace too. All fourteen pieces… What? No, Monsieur Mercier, the court
jewels of the Duchess Swana consisted of fourteen pieces. Why don’t you
check on that? Naturally, we have all the necessary credentials.</p>
<p><strong>rakonin</strong>: Eight Rue de Chalon.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Good morning, Count.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Her Highness is still dressing.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Hello, Leon!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Good morning, Swana.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: It’s really a wretched morning… wretched. I
can’t get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My
face doesn’t compose well… all highlights… how can I dim myself down,
Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had
someone else’s face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice?
Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Your conversation has one marvelous advantage,
Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Don’t you find that restful?… Why didn’t you
come last night?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Darling, I was busy looking out for your
interests.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Did you win?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: We can forget horse racing, roulette, the
stock market… our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch
with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to
me.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: We can be rich if you say the word. I had
dinner with the Guizots last night.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Those newspaper people?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You’d be surprised how many nice people dine
with the Guizots.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: What a gruesome proof of the power of the
press!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now listen, Swana… I sold Monsieur Guizot the
idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. “The Life and
Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia”!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Oh, Leon!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Sweetheart, we won’t have to bother about our
future if you are willing to raffle off your past!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Was it for this that I refused to endorse
Dr. Bertrand’s Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying
that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by
the Romanoffs… and now you want them to smear my life’s secrets over the
front page of a tabloid?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I understand how you feel, but there is a
limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to
pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Imagine two million clerks and shop girls
peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped
around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the
midst of my most intimate moments!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, I am the last person to persuade you,
but don’t do it blindly… if this is your decision, you must be prepared
to face the consequences… I will have to go to work.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I
don’t deserve this. Are you my little Volga boatman?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now, Swana…</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: First tell me, are you my little Volga
boatman?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes, I’m your little Volga boatman.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Well… two million readers… I know exactly
what they want. Chapter One: “A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely
Little Princess Plays with Rasputin’s Beard.”</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’ve got one chapter Guizot thinks is
terrific. “Caviar and Blood.” Swana escapes over the ice!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle
Tom’s Cabin.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once…
weren’t you attacked by a Bolshevik?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Was I? No… not by a Bolshevik!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand
francs!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Count Rakonin asks the privilege of a few
words, Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Count Rakonin?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: He’s a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil.
You know him.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Tell him I won’t be able to see him for a
half an hour.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: The Count says if it could be as soon as
possible. It is luncheon time and he is just between courses.</p>
<p><strong>rakonin</strong>: Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: How do you do, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>rakonin</strong>: Your Highness, forgive this intrusion,
but…</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your
job?</p>
<p><strong>rakonin</strong>: No, madame, something of the utmost
importance… it concerns your jewels.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: My jewels?!</p>
<p><strong>rakonin</strong>: I remember one birthday of His Majesty, our
beloved Czar… I had the honor of being on guard at the summer palace… I
still see you bending before His Majesty… You wore your diadem and a
necklace… your face seemed to be lighted by the jewels.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Why do you bring this up after so many
years?</p>
<p><strong>rakonin</strong>: They are here!… Your jewels!… Here in
Paris!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?</p>
<p><strong>rakonin</strong>: This morning three Soviet agents arrived. I
overheard a telephone conversation with Mercier, the jeweler. Your
Highness, they are going to sell them!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Did I hear something about jewels?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most
amazing news!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Balzac 2769… My lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>rakonin</strong>: I am sorry… I have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in
touch with you.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: This is the Duchess Swana… I want to speak to
Monsieur Cornillon… it’s very important… please get him right away…
Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My
jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them!
Yes… yes… we must act immediately!… Call the police… Have them
arrested!… Well, then, get an injunction!… But do something, Monsieur
Cornillon! …But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting
them back!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What does he say?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Shhh! …But how can there be a question?… Are
you my lawyer or theirs?… All right, I’ll let you know!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: It looks pretty hopeless… there may be a
chance… that’s all… The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia
and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be
able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money,
money!… That’s all they are interested in – those lawyers!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer?
Haven’t you your little Volga boatman?</p>
<p><strong>mercier</strong>: Very good… superb… excellent… it would be
foolish to belittle the quality of the merchandise but your terms are
impossible. My counteroffer is the absolute maximum.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: But, Monsieur Mercier…</p>
<p><strong>mercier</strong>: Gentlemen, I’ll let you in on a little
secret… we are only undertaking this deal for the prestige involved,
and, quite frankly, we are expecting to take a loss.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Capitalistic methods…</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: They accumulate millions by taking loss
after loss.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Hello… this is Buljanoff, Iranoff, and
Kopalski… Who?… Count d’Algout?… No, no… it must be a mistake… we can’t
be disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>mercier</strong>: I assure you no one else could meet the
figure named by my syndicate… at least under the present economic
conditions.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: We can wait.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Do we give the impression of people who are
pressed for money?</p>
<p><strong>mercier</strong>: Yes. Gentlemen… let’s put our cards face
down. Right now there is a Russian commission in New York trying to sell
fifteen Rembrandts. There is another in London mortgaging the oil fields
in Baku. You need money and you need it quickly. I think my offer is
fair and does not even take advantage of your situation.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: He’s cutting our throat…</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: But what can we do?… We have to
accept.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Comrades! Comrades! Don’t let’s give in so
quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: All right, let’s uphold it for another
ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: We don’t want to be disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: My name is Count d’Algout. I telephoned.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: If you want to see us you must come
later.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: But you can’t…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Monsieur Mercier. May I introduce myself? I am
Count Leon d’Algout. I think I had the pleasure of meeting you in your
beautiful shop. I was admiring a platinum watch with diamond
numbers.</p>
<p><strong>mercier</strong>: Oh, yes, yes…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Glorious, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Now, monsieur, you have no right…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Just a moment. I hope you haven’t closed this
deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious
difficulties.</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: Who are you? What do you want?
What is this?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: These jewels are the property of the Duchess
Swana of Russia, and were seized illegally by the Soviet Government. I
am acting for Her Highness, the Duchess. Here is my power of
attorney.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all
non-sense.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: These may have been the jewels of the
Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by
the State.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: We’ll leave the problem of their ownership to
the French courts. Meanwhile I have filed a petition for an injunction
to prohibit you from either selling or removing the jewels. Here is a
copy.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I thought it my duty to warn you. I would hate
to see you get in any trouble, monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>mercier</strong>: Thank you. Gentlemen, this introduces a new
element into our negotiations. Until this claim is completely
settled…</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: We can call our ambassador.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: I give you my word! They were confiscated
legally!</p>
<p><strong>mercier</strong>: Please try to understand my position. I am
not with-drawing. My offer stands and as soon as you produce a clear
title, approved by the French courts, the deal is settled. Until then,
good day.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I hope you will forgive me, Monsieur
Mercier.</p>
<p><strong>mercier</strong>: On the contrary. I consider myself very
lucky. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Good day, monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, gentlemen… how about a little lunch?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Don’t look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not
lost. You may have a chance.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: We may have a chance.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes… a very slim one. I want to be fair. I
don’t deny that you might make out some kind of a case.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: We haven’t anything to discuss with you.
We’ll talk to a lawyer!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: All right – go ahead… you talk to the lawyer
and I’ll talk to the judge!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: That won’t help you! You can’t intimidate
us!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Soviet Russia will put all its might
behind this case.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: You think because you represent the
former Duchess…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: The Duchess…</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: The former Duchess!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful,
exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be
before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand…</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: All right, go ahead, get her on the witness
stand! What can she say?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: But how will she look? The fashions this
spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French,
the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French.
Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the
witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up
your pants and where will it get you?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: I suppose you expect us to hand over the
jewels?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I’m just a
nuisance. All I’m trying to do is make things as difficult as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Not that we are giving in one inch, but
tell us… what is in your mind?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: What proposition?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I just said let’s have a little lunch. Room
service.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Hey, Sascha! Serge! Misha!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Yes, Leon…</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: What is it, my boy?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you
bother? I’ll write it for you.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Leon… Leonitchka… Why are you so good to
us?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Leon, my little boy.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Oh, Leon, you are so good.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What’s the name of that Commissar on the Board
of Trade?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Razinin.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: You wouldn’t like Razinin.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: He’s a bad man. Sends people to
Siberia!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: We don’t like Razinin.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: We like you, Leon – don’t we like
Leon?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff and kopalski</strong>: Yes, we like Leon… little
Leonitchka.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin,
Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in
Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or
removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our
beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff,
Buljanoff, and Kopalski.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: If we say that, Leon… we’ll be sent to
Siberia!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: And if we have to go to Siberia…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’ll send you a muff.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Oh, why are you so good to us?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff and kopalski</strong>: Yes, you are so good,
Leon.</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: Comrade waiter, dear
waiteritchka!… Why are you so good to us? You good waiter!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Take this telegram to the telegraph office at
once!</p>
<p><strong>rakonin</strong>: Yes, monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>lady lavenham</strong>: Good afternoon, messieurs, mes
Comrades.</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: Good afternoon, Lady
Lavenham.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: And how is Lord Lavenham?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: …and little Lady Beatrice?</p>
<p><strong>lady lavenham</strong>: Very well. Did fortune favor you at
the races?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Comme ci, comme ca.</p>
<p><strong>lady lavenham</strong>: I understand… nothing to write home
about.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Who wants to write home about it?</p>
<p><strong>lady lavenham</strong>: It’s just a saying. How about joining
us Saturday night for dinner? We’re having a few friends.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Are we free, Buljanoff?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: We’ll manage.</p>
<p><strong>lady lavenham</strong>: Then let’s say at nine.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Black tie or white tie?</p>
<p><strong>lady lavenham</strong>: Oh, let’s make it white.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Certainly!</p>
<p><strong>lady lavenham</strong>: Au revoir.</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: Au revoir.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Nice people.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Yes, Leon… What is it, Leon?… You can’t
hurry such things… You must give Moscow a little time… There’s nothing
we can do about it… why don’t you drop in later?… Au revoir…</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Misha! Misha!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: A telegram from Moscow! It must have been
here all day!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy
extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority
cancelled herewith. Razinin.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: It is Thursday!</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: It’s six o’clock already!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: I always said it would be Siberia!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow.
He’ll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room
you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Yes, monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Right away… instantly!</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff and kopalski</strong>: Iranoff!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: This is a fine thing. Maybe we’ve missed
him already.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: How can you find somebody without knowing
what he looks like?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: That must be the one!</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Yes, he looks like a comrade!</p>
<p><strong>bearded man and girl</strong>: Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: No, that’s not him…</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Positively not!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I am looking for Michael Simonovitch
Iranoff.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy
Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin.
Present me to your colleagues.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Comrade Buljanoff…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Comrade Kopalski…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise
us with a lady comrade.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: If we had known we would have greeted you
with flowers.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Don’t make an issue of my womanhood. We
are here for work… all of us. Let’s not waste time. Shall we go?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Porter!</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Here, please…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: May I have your bags, madame?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: He is a porter. He wants to carry
them.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Why?… Why should you carry other people’s
bags?</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: Well… that’s my business, madame.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: That’s no business… that’s a social
injustice.</p>
<p><strong>porter</strong>: That depends on the tip.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Allow me, Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: How are things in Moscow?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Very good. The last mass trials were a
great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: It’s a hat, Comrade, a woman’s hat.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Tsk, tsk, tsk, how can such a
civilization survive which permits women to put things like that on
their heads. It won’t be long now, Comrades.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: This is the apartment we have reserved
for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Which part of the room is mine?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: You see… it is a little different here.
They don’t rent rooms in pieces. We had to take the whole suite.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: How much does this cost?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Two thousand francs.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: A week?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: A day.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade
Iranoff?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: A cow?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Two thousand francs. If I stay here a
week I will cost the Russian people seven cows. Who am I to cost the
Russian people seven cows?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: We had to take it on account of the
safe.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: For ourselves… we are much happier now
since we moved to a little room next to the servants’ quarters.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin
in a room like this. Comrades, your telegram was received with great
disfavor in Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: We did our best, Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I hope so for your sake. Let us examine
the case. What does the lawyer say?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Which lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You didn’t get legal advice?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: We didn’t want to get mixed up with
lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a
lawyer… well, there goes another cow.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: We dealt directly with the representative
of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very
clear picture.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I will not repeat your mistake. I will
have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Comrade Buljanoff…</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Yes, Comrade?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two
f’s?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: With two f’s, if you please.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Will you send me some cigarettes, please?
Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you
have been careless in your duty to the State. You were entrusted with
more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious
possessions to the world at this time? Our next year’s crop is in danger
and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors
there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three
comrades…</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: We did it with the best intentions…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: We cannot feed the Russian people on your
intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!… Half of every loaf
of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and
get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Yes, Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public
Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Is there anything I can do, Comrade?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You might get me an accurate map of
Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and
make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Yes, Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>cigarette girls</strong>: Hello! Hello! Cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Comrades, you seem to have been smoking a
lot.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Desk… yes, Monsieur Kopalski… …you are
expecting Count d’Algout… uh huh… but he is not to go to the Royal Suite
under any circumstances. He should go to your new room, 985? Thank you,
monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Good evening, madame.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Good evening. She exits out the door.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You, please.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Yes. Could you give me some
information?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Gladly.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: How long do we have to wait here?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well – until the policeman whistles again.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: At what intervals does he whistle?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: How many minutes between the first and
second whistle?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That’s funny. It’s interesting. I never gave
it a thought before.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Have you never been caught in a similar
situation?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Have I? Do you know when I come to think about
it it’s staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting
for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between
whistles.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: In other words you don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You might hold this for me.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Love to.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Correct me if I am wrong… We are facing
north, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Facing north… I’d hate to commit myself
without my compass… Pardon me… are you an explorer?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No… I am looking for the Eiffel
Tower.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Is that thing lost again?… Listen… if you are
interested in a view…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from
a technical standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Technical… I couldn’t help you from that
angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in
moments of despair to jump off.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: How long does it take a man to land?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now, isn’t that too bad! The last time I
jumped I forgot to clock it! Let me see… Eiffel Tower… Your finger,
please.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Why do you need my finger?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Bad manners to point with your own… Here… the
Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: And where are we?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Here… here we are… here you are and here I am…
feel it?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I am interested only in the shortest
distance between these two points. Must you flirt?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I don’t have to but I find it natural.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Suppress it.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: For my own information would you call
your approach toward me typical of the local morale?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Madame, it is that kind of approach which has
made Paris what it is.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You are very sure of yourself, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Nothing has occurred recently to shake my
confidence.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I have heard of the arrogant male in
capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes
you like that.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade… I have
been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Your type will soon be extinct.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Please… can you tell me the exact width
of the foundation on which the piers are resting?… and the depth?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: You don’t have to worry. The thing is
safe.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I am not afraid… I want to know…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: The foundation is one hundred and forty-one
yards square… I hope you’ll forgive me but I thought you’d…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a
depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and
one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work
which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: That’s a strange angle.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes, very strange.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Ascending to the tower is a staircase
consisting of eight hundred and twenty- nine steps… …and an additional
two hundred and fifty-four steps to the very top… There is an elevator
included in the price of admission!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You gave me some very valuable
information. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: And thank you for getting me up here. I’ve
never seen this before. Beautiful, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’m glad I saw it before becoming extinct.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold
your frivolity against you. As basic material you might not be bad, but
you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for
you.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You must admit that this doomed old
civilization sparkles… It glitters!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I do not deny its beauty, but it is a
waste of electricity.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards…
blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe… made
to greet Napoleon’s army. The Opera! And Montmartre… Montparnasse… La
Boh�me… and now I’ll show you the greatest attraction! It will cost me a
franc but it is worth it. The most wonderful spot in all Paris – unique!
Here, look…. What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I see a house that looks like any other
house. What’s remarkable about it?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It’s not the structure but the spirit which
dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to
hospitality.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: So that is your house?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, let’s say I live in it. Such a pleasant
place… all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus,
and subway…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Does that mean that you want me to go
there?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Please don’t misunderstand me…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Then you don’t want me to go there.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now I didn’t say that either… naturally
nothing would please me more.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Then why don’t we go? You might be an
interesting subject of study.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I will do my best.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No… Count d’Algout is still out. Yes, as
soon as he returns I’ll tell him. Yes… I’ll tell him Monsieur
Buljanoff.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Good evening, Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Good evening, Monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Is this what you call the “butler”?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Good evening, comrade. This man is
horribly old. You should not make him work.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: He takes good care of that.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: He looks sad. Do you whip him?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No, though the mere thought makes my mouth
water.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: The day will come when you will be free.
Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Count d’Algout, there have been several
telephone…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about
something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Thank you. I’ve had all the calories
necessary for today.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: What do we do now?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: We take off our hat and coat. We sit down – we
make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a
most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile. Well… we don’t
smile. How about some music?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Is that customary?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It helps. It has ever since King David wooed
Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at
hand, I shall turn on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I should say this room is eighteen by
twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Not too big and not too small. What I’d call
the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above
average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have
nothing to conceal. Just look around. That’s my desk. Those are my
books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I will start with you.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That’s great. I’m thirty-five years old. Just
over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds
stripped.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: And what is your profession?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert,
keeping my landlord appeased. That’s a full-time job.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: And what do you do for mankind?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: For mankind not a thing – for womankind the
record is not quite so bleak.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You are something we do not have in
Russia.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Thank you. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: That is why I believe in the future of my
country.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I begin to believe in it myself since I’ve met
you. I still don’t know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens
me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni-
notchka.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Ni-notchka.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: That is correct.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Ninotchka, do you like me just a little
bit?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Your general appearance is not
distasteful.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Look at me. The whites of your eyes are
clear. Your cornea is excellent.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Your cornea is terrific. Tell me – you’re so
expert on things – can it be that I’m falling in love with you?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You are bringing in wrong values. Love is
a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say
chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Oh, I see. What do you use instead?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I acknowledge the existence of a natural
impulse common to all.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What can I possibly do to encourage such an
impulse in you?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You don’t have to do a thing. Chemically
we are already quite sympathetic.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You’re the most improbable creature I’ve ever
met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You repeat yourself.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’d like to say it a thousand times.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Don’t do it, please.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’m at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me
if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I’m just a poor
bourgeois.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It’s never too late to change. I used to
belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me
to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: The bayonet? Did you really?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I was wounded before Warsaw.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Wounded? How?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry
Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’d love to. Tsk, tsk, tsk.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Don’t pity me. Pity the Polish lancer.
After all, I’m alive.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What kind of a girl are you, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Just what you see. A tiny cog in the
great wheel of evolution.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You’re the most adorable cog I ever saw in my
life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I
could feel like this toward a sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Do you hear that?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It’s twelve o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It’s midnight. One half of Paris is making
love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other
hand. They kiss. Isn’t that wonderful?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: That’s the way a clock works. There’s
nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a
romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I can’t possibly think of a better reason.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It’s false sentimentality.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: to make her mood</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You are very talkative.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Was that talkative?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No, that was restful. Again.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible,
unromantic, statistical…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Glorious, analytical…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: The telephone is ringing.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Oh, let it ring.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: But one of your friends may be in need of
you. You must answer.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Hello?… Yes… I’m sorry but I couldn’t make it.
I ran into a friend from the army… What?… The deal is off! Are you
crazy, Buljanoff?…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …A special envoy arrived… What?… That sounds
better. I’ll be glad to see her any time she wants… Oh, she doesn’t want
to see me? What do you know about that? Why?… Well, I’ll get in touch
with her myself. What’s her name?… …What?… Yaku… How do you spell it?…
Heavens! those Russian names! …I… Oh, Y…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yakushova… Ninotch…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: All right. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: him as he walks over</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I must go.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy
Yakushova…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Let’s forget that we ever met.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I have a better suggestion. Let’s forget that
the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova… you are
Ninotchka… my Ninotchka…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I was sent here by my country to fight
you.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: All right, fight me, fight me as much as you
want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There’s nothing sweeter than
sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: As a representative of Moscow…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Tonight let’s not represent anybody but
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It is out of the question. If you wish to
approach me…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You know I want to…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Then do it through my lawyer!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Ninotchka, you can’t walk out like this… I’m
crazy about you, and I thought I’d made an impression on you. You liked
the white of my eye.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I must go.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You
kissed me!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I kissed the Polish lancer too… before he
died.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Good morning, Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Good morning, Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Count d’Algout is still asleep.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: That’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Leon! What in heaven’s name…!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Is anything wrong? Are you ill?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Don’t tell me the bed has lost its best
friend.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I just couldn’t sleep. I got up and went back…
and then got up again. These last few days… whew!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Darling, you’re taking my business affairs
far too seriously. Much as I’d love to rob the Bolsheviks of their
filthy money, I won’t do it at the expense of your health. Particularly
as we know we won’t get much. You look so pale… pale but
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Your breakfast, monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I don’t feel like any breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make
yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don’t keep up your strength.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Shall I draw your bath, sir?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Make it ice cold.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Not in your condition. Make it tepid, Gaston…
tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit. Afterwards I’ll drive you
through the Bois. Slowly… in Waltz time.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: A blue shirt, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Blue? Let’s offset his mood. Find a striped
one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Very well, Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Now… here we have two very handsome
soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs?
Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We’ll put in a great nugget
of butter, plenty of pepper and salt… Darling, I haven’t seen you for
three livelong days… seventy-two hours!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Oh, please, Swana! I don’t know whether I’m
standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting
you when I’m trying to concentrate on another woman and can’t get near
her.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: You haven’t seen her yet?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No, and believe me I’ve tried everything! I
must have telephoned her a hundred times. I’ve sent her telegrams, I’ve
sent her flowers… I asked her to dinner… I offered her seats for the
Opera…</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: That proletarian! In the old days we’d have
had her flogged.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That wouldn’t have done any good. Not with
her. She’s the most incredible creature I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: You just told me you hadn’t seen her.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well… er… I caught a glimpse of her when she
walked through the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting
Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look
like?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You can’t imagine.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: That bad? Old or young?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Timeless. When she comes into a room you’d
think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap
miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli.
What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: You saw all that in one glimpse?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Darling, if we’re going to get anywhere
someone has to keep his eyes open!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine
bath and let Gaston shave you.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Gaston!</p>
<p><strong>the three russians</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: We want to talk to Count d’Algout. My name
is Kopalski.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Oh… you are the three gentlemen from
Moscow?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: You may wait.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: That’s her.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the
door for us.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Once in Petersburg I was driving down the
Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down
from the opposite direction, and when I couldn’t make way quick enough
she spat in my face.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Now look here, Buljanoff. You never were in
Petersburg, you never owned a cart, and she never spat in your face. Who
are you trying to impress?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Hello, boys.</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: Leon!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Come in, come in.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What’s new?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to
negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She’s going to make a
precedent of it!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: She says she won’t be intimidated by
parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a
blackmailer.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What did she say about me?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: I think she covered you with the
parasites.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: And Leonitchka! What she said about
us…!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: And they might believe her in Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: What do you mean they might – they
will!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: We don’t blame you, Leon, but when we came
from Russia we believed in simplicity…</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: We avoided luxury and extravagance and
today… well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn’t
say no.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, boys, I’d like to help you but what can
I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: She doesn’t leave her room! She has been
locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: All right, then make an appointment with her
so I can see her!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: We can’t… but you are so ingenious,
Leon…</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: You found your way to us and we weren’t
easy to reach, were we?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Didn’t we put up a strong resistance?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Oh, yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: You must help us, Leon… if you don’t win
her over we’re on our way to Siberia!</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Or it might be the firing squad!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Or we can’t go back to Russia!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: What’s wrong with that?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Yes! We could stay with Leon!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Leon, how would you like to have three
lifelong friends?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Boys, boys… don’t forget Russia is your mother
country. Three sons walking out all at once… that’s too much for any
mother.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Well, if your mother turns against you,
you have to look for someone to adopt you.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Leon! Just a minute…</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I’m leaving, dear. I’m lunching at Fouquet’s
if you can make it, and… Leon, remember, a man should think it over
twice before he decides to become a mother.</p>
<p><strong>first lawyer</strong>: I seem to remember some additional
injunctive provision dealing with the property of foreigners residing in
France.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You are referring to paragraph 59b,
section 25f of the Civil Code.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Page eight hundred twenty-four.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: And do not fail to read the three
footnotes. While you are studying it I will eat. Food please.</p>
<p><strong>rakonin</strong>: Room service… Just a moment please.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Room service speaking.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets,
beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty… What? There is a strike
in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy
in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell
them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables… What? You won’t
serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to
let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from
me you’re weakening the people.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: So! You want to make a strike breaker out of
me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of
the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say
to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal
Suite!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Tsk, tsk, tsk.</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Where to, madame?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Can you recommend a restaurant?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Well, there’s Pruniers if you care for
seafood. If you want to lunch in the Bois, there’s…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Where do you eat?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: At P�re Mathieu’s.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Where is that?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: It’s just a place for workmen.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>taxi driver</strong>: Eight blocks down in the Rue de
Poivrel.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>p�re mathieu</strong>: This way, madame. Are you alone? By
the window perhaps? Or a nice little corner table?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: This will do.</p>
<p><strong>p�re mathieu</strong>: I think this is the first time you
have been to my little place. Your face is new to me. Now, what shall it
be?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Raw carrots and beets.</p>
<p><strong>p�re mathieu</strong>: Oh, madame! This is a restaurant, not
a meadow.</p>
<p><strong>p�re mathieu</strong>: Here is what we are offering today.
Please make your choice. I am sure you will find something to tempt your
appetite.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Why, hello! It certainly is a small world!</p>
<p><strong>p�re mathieu</strong>: Well, madame? Shall we start with
soup? Fish soup today. I got up at five to fish them from the Seine.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Crayfish soup for me!</p>
<p><strong>p�re mathieu</strong>: Very well, monsieur. Then, may I
suggest an omelet with mushrooms?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Bring me something simple. I never think
about food.</p>
<p><strong>p�re mathieu</strong>: But, madame! If you don’t think about
food what do you think about?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: The future of the common people.</p>
<p><strong>p�re mathieu</strong>: That also is a question of food,
madame. I’ll bring you a nice little lunch � la P�re Mathieu.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted
him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a
musician you don’t like music. That good old man believes in food as you
believe in Karl Marx. You can’t go around hurting people, Comrade
Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how? By
eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by
having a good time for the first time in your natural life!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I don’t like your following me.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I didn’t follow you.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Then how did you get here?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I always eat here.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: This is a place for workmen.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: But my dear child, I am most at home among
working men. I hate the places where you circulate – the Hotel Clarence…
This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen!
At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Hyah!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Hyah, fellows!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: They are all my friends. They’re a swell
bunch!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Ah, my friend! I’m happy to see you again!</p>
<p><strong>p�re mathieu</strong>: I’m always glad to meet a new
customer, and I hope this first visit will not be your last.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Just an old man. His memory is getting
weak.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: What are you after?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Must one always be after something?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Your tactics are useless. My name is
neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If
you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an
injustice. When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea
that you had any connection with this deal?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: But you have now, and I know now that you
are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished
by death.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life,
Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we
are living? The only moment we really have? Don’t take it all so
seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please… relax… I beg you,
Sergeant… smile!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Will you smile?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Just smile.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: At what?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle
of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and
exaggerating their own importance. If you can’t find anything else to
laugh at you can laugh at you and me.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Because we are an odd couple.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Then you should go back to your
table.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No, I can’t leave you. I won’t. Not yet. Not
until I’ve made you laugh… at least once.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Ha! Ha! Now go back.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That’s not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the
heart. Now let’s see. I’m going to tell you a funny story. Just a
moment… I’ve got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who
went to America…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: On which boat?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, er… let’s drop it. I don’t think you
would care for that one.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Probably not.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Do you like Scotch stories?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I have never heard one.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Two Scotchmen met on the street… and I don’t
know the name of the street and it really doesn’t matter. Well, anyway,
one’s name was McIntosh and the other’s was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says
to McGillicuddy, “Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy,” and McGillicuddy says to
McIntosh, “Hello, Mr. McIntosh,” and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy,
“How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?” and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, “How
is Mrs. McIntosh?”…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I wish they had never met.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: So do I. Now, here’s a great one… Ha! Ha! Ha!
Well, maybe it’s not so good. Let’s forget it! How’s this? Two men are
looking at the moon. One says to the other, “Is it true that a lot of
people live on the moon?” “Yes, it is,” says the other, “five hundred
million.” “Whew!” replies the first, “they must get pretty crowded when
it’s half moon!” Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I suppose you don’t think that’s funny?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It seemed funny to me when I first heard it.
Maybe the trouble isn’t with the joke. Maybe it’s with you!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Maybe you haven’t any sense of humor. Well,
I’ll give you one more chance! Now listen!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: When I heard this joke for the first time I
laughed myself sick. Here goes! A man comes into a restaurant and sits
down and says, “Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream.” After
five minutes the waiter comes back and says, “I’m sorry, sir, we’re all
out of cream, can it be without milk?”</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Not funny, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: So you don’t think that’s funny? It is funny!
Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’ll tell you that joke again. A man comes
into a restaurant. Did you get that?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: He sits down at the table and says to the
waiter… Did you get that too?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, so far it isn’t funny, but wait. He says
to the waiter, “Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee.” So the waiter comes
back five minutes later and says, “I’m sorry, sir, we have no coffee.”…
Wait a minute… wait a minute… I’m all mixed up… A man comes in a
restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, “Waiter! Get
me a cup of coffee without cream,” and five minutes later the waiter
comes back and says, “I’m sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a
glass of milk!”</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Ah! You have no sense of humor! That settles
it! You have no sense of humor! None! No humor!!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What’s funny about this?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: In addition to the arguments above
enumerated for lifting this injunction, we wish to cite the decision of
the High Court of Paris, rendered in the case of Princess Marishka
against the Government of Montenegro on the fifth day of August, 1897.
Comparing the facts in that case with our present set of facts we feel
that the Treaty between the Republic of France and the U.S.S.R. should
prevail over all…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I’m sorry, gentlemen. The other day I
heard such a funny story… It still makes me laugh. It is very funny. I
am sorry. Oh yes… about this injunction…</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: The hearing is set for the twentieth of this
month.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: That’s two weeks from Thursday…</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: We did our utmost to have it set ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: completely different from her former</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Yes. It is unfortunate.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Well, there’s nothing we can do about it.
Why get excited?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: We’ll leave these papers here for your
further consideration. Au revoir, madame.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Au revoir.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Well, it means another two weeks in
Paris.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Too bad we have to waste all that time.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: I acted on your suggestion and got in
touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit
their plants they are open to you.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: There’s something else which I know will
appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely
instructive.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Huh?… Why don’t you get a haircut,
Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep
the windows closed? Isn’t it amazing, at home there’s still snow and ice
and here… Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our
swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I
know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate… well,
Comrades, I don’t think I need you any more.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: If there is anything we can do for
you…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No, not a thing. Would you like to go
out?</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: Thank you, Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Have you any money?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Well, here are fifty francs.</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: Thank you, Comrade, thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Bring me forty-five back.</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: Naturally, Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What time have you, Gaston?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Eight forty-two, sir.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I guess it is eight forty-two.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: You seem to be a bit nervous, sir.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I am, Gaston.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: If you will forgive me, ever since you met
that Bolshevik lady I’ve noticed a distinct change in you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Have you?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Decidedly. Yesterday I was greatly amazed
when I came from the market and found that you had made your bed,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt
I’d contributed something.</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Well, sir, if you should do it again, which
I hope you won’t, please remember the order. Counterpane, blanket,
blanket, sheet, sheet.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Ah, there’s something poetic about the simple
processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet… it
should be set to music!</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: May I add, sir, that it was with great
amazement that I found a copy of Karl Marx’s Capital on your night
table. That is a socialistic volume which I refuse to so much as dust,
sir. I view with alarm, sir, the influence over you of this Bolshevik
lady.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I can’t follow you, Gaston, isn’t it about
time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my
servant? Wouldn’t you like to stand on an equal footing with me?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Isn’t there any revolt in you? Sometimes when
I order you around don’t you feel like kicking me in the pants?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Oh, you’re a reactionary! Don’t you look
forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your
two feet and say, “Hey, you, d’Algout! from now on it’s going to be
share and share alike”?</p>
<p><strong>gaston</strong>: Emphatically not, sir. The prospect
terrifies me. Now, don’t misunderstand me, sir, I don’t resent your not
paying me for the past two months, but the thought that I should split
my bank account with you… that you should take half of my life’s
savings… that is really too much for me.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Go to bed, little father, go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I don’t look too foolish?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the
boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the
other, and when I caught up with it I would say, “Just a moment, you
charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka… you two were meant
for each other.” Ninotchka feels more comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You remember this room?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I’ve never been here before. I wonder
whom you’re thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out
each step, worrying about north and south. Today… now this might shock
you… I went up to a taxi and said “Eight Rue du Bois”… and here I
am.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You see? Life can be so simple.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: For twelve francs, seventy-five.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The
son-of-a-gun made a detour!… But he got you here.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It’s nine o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That’s when one half of Paris says to the
other half, “What are your plans for this evening, madame?”</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: more in the spirit of her change of</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: A wonderful idea! Radio or records?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Not radio. Let’s have music that’s just
for ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’ll play it softly because I have things to
tell you about which I can’t shout.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, my darling… I… we…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You see I couldn’t shout that.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Leon, you know the jokes you told me a
few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them.
Now, Leon that’s wrong. I know they’re not funny, they’re silly. They’re
stupid. And still… I laugh… and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and
Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them – then I
realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to
Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat… and if this
keeps on… am I too talkative?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No… go on.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Leon, I want to tell you something which
I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say,
because I thought it didn’t exist… and, Leon… I can’t say it…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What a gesture for a sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Leon, I would like to ask you
something.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Anything, Ninotchka.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: If you don’t want to answer, you needn’t.
But if you do, you must tell me the truth.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I promise… I swear.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Did you make any change in this room?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: When I was here before I noticed a
photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what
a waste of silver. That’s all that interested me then. Now I would like
to know… what happened to the woman?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: The Duchess.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: She is very attractive. She has great
elegance. She’s what you call a woman of the world, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Ninotchka, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I suppose she is very entertaining… It
must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Ninotchka, you’re jealous.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Leon, don’t ever ask me for a picture of
myself… I couldn’t bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer… I
couldn’t breathe, I couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: My darling.</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Good evening, Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very
crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Certainly, Your Highness, this way
please… Count d’Algout made the reservation this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Count d’Algout…</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: It is only a small table but it will be
no trouble to put in some extra chairs.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: No, that’s another party.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Why don’t we go some other place? It’s so
crowded here.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: No, no! This is glory! At last I’m going to
have a look at that female Bolshevik. Can you give us another table?</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Only one in the rear, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: That’s perfect!</p>
<p><strong>another woman guest</strong>: You mean Leon’s bringing the
Bolshevik you told us about?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Isn’t it divine?</p>
<p><strong>another guest</strong>: I wouldn’t have missed this for the
world.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: anticipation of a</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Is this satisfactory?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Thank you, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>headwaiter</strong>: Is it to be dinner, monsieur?</p>
<p><strong>general savitzky</strong>: Possibly later. We’ll just start
with champagne.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I’m only afraid that the doorman may spoil
our fun. If only he lets her in!</p>
<p><strong>general savitzky</strong>: Your Highness…</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Yes, General Savitzky?</p>
<p><strong>general savitzky</strong>: I want you to know all the White
Russian exiles in Paris are keeping their fingers crossed about the
jewels. They are very interested in the case. Swana suspects her
countrymen.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Are they indeed? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>general savitzky</strong>: They hope the settlement will
bring you a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: General, please… if you hear any rumors that
I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?</p>
<p><strong>guest</strong>: Look! There’s Leon!</p>
<p><strong>everyone at the table</strong>: Oh yes! Where? There! Oh! How
exciting!</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: Isn’t she something?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Shall we dance, General Savitzky?</p>
<p><strong>guest</strong>: Are you crazy?</p>
<p><strong>another guest</strong>: How could you make such a remark?</p>
<p><strong>third guest</strong>: Swana isn’t stupid.</p>
<p><strong>marianne</strong>: What did I say? I just said “isn’t she
something?” I didn’t say something what.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Is it dry?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, monsieur.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Is that right or do you prefer it sweet?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I wouldn’t know. The closest I ever came
to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing
it at a battleship.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It’s always good luck to launch something with
champagne; a battleship… or an evening.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It’s funny to look back. I was brought up
on goat’s milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now
champagne.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: From goats to grapes. That’s drinking in the
right direction.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Ugh… um… oh… It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: From what I read I thought champagne was
a strong drink. It’s very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on
this?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: There have been cases… but the headache the
next morning is worth while – if you drink it with the right toast. To
us, Ninotchka!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Hello, Leon! What a surprise! You of all
people! How are you, my dear?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Hello, Swana. How do you do, General
Savitzky?</p>
<p><strong>general savitzky</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: You’re looking magnificent, Leon… …isn’t he,
General Savitzky?</p>
<p><strong>general savitzky</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Is this your new dress suit?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes, Swana.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Didn’t I tell you Benson and Benson were the
tailors for you?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes, Swana, you did.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: It’s a dream of beauty. He never takes my
word for anything, but I was right, wasn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes, Swana.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Am I interrupting?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Not at all. Your Highness, may I present
Madame Yakushova?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: And General Savitzky.</p>
<p><strong>general savitzky</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I’ve some wonderful news for you, Leon. It’s
about Punchy… do you mind if I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No… please…</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: General, would you mind making my excuses at
our table? I’ll be back in a few moments.</p>
<p><strong>general savitzky</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Well, Leon, we can be proud of our Punchy. He
had a triumph at the dog show.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge.
Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see
him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.
You see, Count d’Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday. You must have
searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn’t
you, Leon?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Months, Swana.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Poor Madame Yakushova… here we are talking in
mysteries…. I’m sure you wonder what it’s all about.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Not at all…. I understand perfectly,
Count d’Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Dear me… I must be losing my finesse. If I’m
not careful I’ll be understood by everybody.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: There’s a charming crowd here tonight, isn’t
there?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I’m going, Leon… but before I leave I must
compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they’re
wearing in Moscow this year?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No, last year, madame.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Isn’t it amazing! One gets a wrong impression
of the new Russia. It must be charming. I’m glad conditions are so
improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their
dances?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Exactly. You see, it would have been
embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old
Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very
becoming, and you know how vain women are.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: You’re absolutely right about the Cossacks.
We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They
had such reliable guns.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the
good old days.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: A very wise suggestion, Leon. I’m afraid
madame and I will never agree. The only thing we have in common is our
lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will
be over by Thursday. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You’re right, madame, it will all be over
by Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: It is unfortunate that you have so few more
days in Paris. Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take
some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow. Good night. Good
night, Leon.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Good night, Swana.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Now I think I need a glass of
champagne.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Quickly, please… tell me one of your
funny stories.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: A funny story?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You never finished the one about the two
Scotchmen with the names.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named
McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No, darling. I’ll tell you another story, a
much better one. The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the
lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We
won’t let it happen. I’ll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good
story?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Wonderful – if one could believe it.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You must, darling.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: To the loveliest story I ever heard.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: conversation may</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You just made that trip from goats to grapes a
little too fast.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Oh, everything is so wonderful! It’s
getting farther and farther away!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What, darling?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes. Don’t worry. Everything will be all
right.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Comrades! Comrades!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Darling, darling… please!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I must talk to my brothers!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Shhh! Shhh!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Don’t shush me. I am People! I want to
make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: But, darling, you can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Comrades! Good people of France!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now, Ninotchka… please!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: They are all Duchesses here… thousands of
Duchesses… and I am going to tell them.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Quite right… yes, yes, yes, but first you’re
going in that door and you’re going to take a little spirits of ammonia
and lie down.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No speech?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: addressing a little</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I love you, my little Leonitchka!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: And I adore you, Ninotchua.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Give me a double brandy.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’m very sorry, Count d’Algout, it is most
embarrassing, but the lady you brought with you tonight is spreading
communistic propaganda in the powder room.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Give me another double brandy.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: That kind of propaganda is bad anywhere,
but inciting the attendants of a powder room to go on strike…. Well, if
she succeeds the consequences will be disastrous.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What can I do about it?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: She has been asked to leave the powder room
but without success. We would appreciate if you would see to it
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: You want me to go in there?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’m sorry, sir, but I must insist.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Make it a triple brandy. As we</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: All right… you can tell the Duchess… you can
tell everybody… they know anyhow… it doesn’t make any difference… now
get out!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Don’t tell them where we’re going,
sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No. Nobody will find us.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Are we going to build our little
house?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes… a little white house.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Not white, darling.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: All right, we’ll make it red.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No, don’t let’s have it any color… no
color… just a house house… let’s form our own party.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Right: Lovers of the world unite!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: And we won’t stretch up our arms…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: …and we won’t clench our fist…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Our salute will be a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes… a kiss… salute!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I am so happy. No one can be so happy
without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished. I
want to confess, darling.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I know… it’s the Russian soul.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Everyone wants to confess and if they
don’t confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you
I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the
wall.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Would that make you any happier?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Much happier.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I have paid the penalty. Now let’s have
some music.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Let’s turn on the radio.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Radio! What is radio?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It’s a little box that you buy on the
installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new
model.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that
turns… a little knob… it must be somewhere around here… yes… here… I
see…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Here it is!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What shall we get? The news!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No, no news. We don’t want to know what’s
happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes, sweetheart… all by ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Well, then we turn twice to the right and
stop at seven…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Well, it has to warm up… you have to give it a
chance… just like people… like you and me… first you wanted to fight me
and now we belong to the same party… salute!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Now twice to the left and stop at
seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No music.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No, no music.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: There it is… Thursday… you can’t rip it
out of the week….</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: But I can throw it out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It wouldn’t be fair to the man in the
street. There they are… they are terrible things, those jewels….</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: …but big.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: …they are the tears of Old Russia… see
that stone?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Who cried that one?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine
the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now, darling, don’t get impatient, wait until
we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine… that
reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, “Darling, I
drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!”</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: First ten thousand serfs… now just
Gaston. It is very encouraging.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You
will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can
look.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: They belong to the people.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I give them back to the people… I make you
Ninotchka the Great… Duchess of the People!… Grand Duchess of the
People!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Is this the wish of the masses?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It is their wish.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Thank you, Leon… thank you, masses. Can I
make a speech now?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Comrades! People of the world! The
revolution is on the march… I know… wars will wash over us… bombs will
fall… all civilization will crumble… but not yet, please… wait, wait…
what’s the hurry? Let us be happy… give us our moment…. We are happy,
aren’t we, Leon?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: So happy and so tired.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Smile, little father, smile.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: It is tomorrow morning… tomorrow noon, to be
exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it’s extremely cruel to waken
anyone at such an hour. Don’t you recognize me? I am the Duchess
Swana.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I know how you feel, my dear. The morning
after always does look grim if you happen to be wearing last night’s
dress. Don’t be embarrassed by my presence, though. You couldn’t have
found anybody more sympathetic to your condition. I remember once in
Petrograd when I felt exactly as you do. I had to bow from a balcony to
the crowd. My dear, the masses have no understanding of the feelings of
a lady before noon. Don’t you find that true?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I think we can cut your visit short. Leon
is not here.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Of course not, my dear! I didn’t come here
with any such suspicion. How ridiculous! Nor did I come here to pick up
his hat.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: How stale last night’s gaiety looks! It has
the taste of a dead cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: If you were encouraged to come here by
our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Don’t worry, you were quite rude enough. Do
you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I’m sure it will
make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full
possession of your faculties, at least.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Please come to the point. What is it you
want?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I just dropped in to have a little
heart-to-heart talk with you.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: We have nothing to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit
down for a little chat, I’m sure we won’t run out of conversation and
what’s more it won’t be dull.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Madame, what is it you people always say,
regardless of what you mean… “I am delighted to have you here”? I have
not reached that stage of civilization.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: That’s all right… I grow on people.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I must ask you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Leave? That’s exactly what I came here to ask
you to do. Leave! I don’t mean this hotel and I don’t mean Paris… I mean
France. There’s a plane for Moscow at five-forty.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Madame, if you…</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Don’t worry. I have already made
reservations. It’s perfect flying weather. They assure me there’s a fine
tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: If this is meant to be a joke it is not
funny. Or do you still think you’re issuing orders from your palace in
Petrograd?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: My palace in Petrograd… yes, you took that
away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I
had… but nothing more – I warn you.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: People cannot be taken away, madame,
neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love.
You hadn’t. That’s why you’re not in Russia any longer, and that’s why
you came here this morning.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Very interesting, my dear, but couldn’t you
write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery
– would be an amusing paradox.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It is not enough to be witty, madame.
People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before.
Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: My dear, you don’t know how impressive I
could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my
jewels?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: You can’t deny we gave the people their
money’s worth – almost – eight tumbling Romanoffs – eight!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I must insist that you leave.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Not before you agree to use those
reservations to Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: In that case I can only say good-by.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: �lys�e 2763.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I wouldn’t waken Leon. After last night I
would say not before three o’clock at the earliest.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I told you to go, madame.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Believe me, Leon can’t help you. He doesn’t
know anything about the jewels… I give you my word… I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: You were very careless with our precious
jewels, my dear. They’re too expensive a toy for two children to play
with.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Don’t worry. Fortunately last night a very
trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his
function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian. I just put
this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But
if you feel like notifying the police…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You leave me no choice.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Won’t it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet
Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I will have to face the consequences, but
so will you. Don’t forget they will ask how you got them.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: That’s very simple to answer. They were given
to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact
they’re mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: They always belonged to the Russian
people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives
and you will give them back!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall
we sit down?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Now, let’s free ourselves from emotionalism
and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has
changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I
have the jewels.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: In other words moral ideas have no weight
with you… all right, then let’s deal with legal facts. You know that
France has recognized the Soviet.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the
State. France is going to uphold that ownership.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: My lawyer agrees with you. He says France
will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court,
don’t forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as
always, conservative.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Won’t those two years in court be
expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could
squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now…</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I may run out of money, but you have already
run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to
wait.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I see. You have calculated in terms of
hunger.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial.
Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can
condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my
proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign
the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: That’s not the way to win him back… not
Leon.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: I think I know Leon quite as well as you…
possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you
time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally
you’ll be too busy for any farewells. I’ll see to it that everything is
done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the
airport. That’s my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Yes… Oh hello…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Good morning, Leon… … no, you didn’t
waken me… I am fine, thank you…. Yes, it was… marvelous…. What?… for
luncheon? I’m afraid I can’t. I am going to be very busy… well, I have a
lot of things to attend to today…. What?… Well to tell you the truth I
am a little tired and I would like to rest… you may be right… perhaps it
is the champagne…. For dinner?… Of course… seven o’clock here?… seven
o’clock is all right…. Where?… That will be lovely…. Yes… Come in. Yes?…
Just a moment…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You can leave it here.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Operator, will you switch the call
please?… Hello?… Darling, your present just arrived…. It’s very silly
and very wonderful… thank you… No, I won’t forget… seven o’clock….
Good-by, my darling…. What?… Oh… salute!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I am sorry to have kept you waiting,
madame.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Good afternoon, Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Good afternoon, Your Highness. Madame, I…</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: You didn’t find my glove. All right, you’re
forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Thank you, Your Highness. Count d’Algout is
waiting. He’s been here some time.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea
or a cocktail?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: No thanks, Swana.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Did I act stupidly last night? Should I
apologize?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’m the one who should apologize. I should
have talked to you before.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Is this, by any chance, going to be a
confession?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you
forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain – Never Explain. It has
worked so often and so perfectly, don’t let’s break the rule. And please
don’t look so guilty, otherwise I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: This time, Swana – just this once – I must ask
you to listen.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: All right, I’ll listen.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I know you hate the obvious but do you mind
if, at this moment, I’m not in the least subtle?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Brutal frankness, if you insist.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I
feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I’m in love, Swana.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: And I thought it was something serious! How
could you frighten me so?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I’d
have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle
class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I’m in
love, Swana.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a
wonderful safety valve, and that’s what you need – because you know it’s
impossible, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may
find it shockingly banal. I’ve thought it over and I’m willing to take
all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way
of living.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Leon! This has the ugly sound of
regeneration.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’m afraid that’s what it is.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: The same old trouble, Leon. You’re always
late. Whether you’re taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a
beauty shop, you’re never on time. And now, when it’s a question of your
reform – late again. By about five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What is this, Swana?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Knowing the efficiency of the French Air
Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken
off for Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Has done what?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: She’s gone, Leon.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Do you expect me to believe that?</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Here’s the telephone. If you call the hotel
you will find that you have no seven o’clock appointment.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Imagine, for once in our lives we were in
Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant
on the second floor.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: While you eat, you look at the view.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Yes, it is an amazing piece of
engineering. Still the most remarkable iron structure in the world.
Leading to the top there is a staircase of over a thousand steps… but an
elevator is included in the price of admission.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Well, everything is in order. I hope you
will enjoy your trip to Russia, madame.</p>
<p><strong>english lady</strong>: Thank you. Oh, by the way, I’ve heard
so many rumors about laundry conditions in Russia. Is it advisable to
take one’s own towels?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Certainly not, madame. That’s only
capitalistic propaganda. We change the towel every week.</p>
<p><strong>english lady</strong>: Oh… thank you.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Yes, please?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Yes… Comrade Cazabine? No, I’m sorry… he
hasn’t been with us for six months. He was called back to Russia and was
investigated. You can get further details from his widow.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Pardon me, I am very interested in what you
just said – you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia – if they don’t
like what he has done they put him out of the way?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Not always… look at me… I’ve been back
twice.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Here’s my passport…. Please give me a visa. I
have to leave for Russia immediately.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Count Leon d’Algout… a count!… a
nobleman!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Don’t hold that against me… please!</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Why should an aristocrat want to go to
Russia?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Business.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: What business?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Private.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: There is no privacy in Russia. This whole
thing seems very suspicious. What’s the real reason? If you ever want to
get into Russia, take my advice… confess!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Confess what?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Are you sympathetic to the former
Czaristic government – the White Russians?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: On the contrary – I don’t want to have
anything to do with them.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: You believe in our cause?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Oh… I think it’s great! Everyone works –
everyone contributes – that’s what I want to do – work! I make my own
bed – you can call up my butler! I don’t believe in the right of the
individual. I like the Bolshevik ideal – everyone being the same. You
just like me – me just like you – I use your comb – you use my
toothbrush – oh, it’s a great life…. Please… give me that visa!</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Hello, Leon darling!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: After our talk last night I took it for
granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult
it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance
to you. May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia…
another Russia.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now, please, Swana.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Count d’Algout was for several years my
personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for
him I’ll be delighted.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That does it, Swana. Now you mustn’t miss your
appointment with your hair-dresser.</p>
<p><strong>swana</strong>: Just in case they don’t give you your visa to
Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs
and rented a lovely little ch�teau in the Touraine, and if you feel the
need of a change…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: She must have her little joke. You’re not
going to take that seriously.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: The Grand Duchess Swana… active in the
White Russian movement?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Believe me, I have no connection with her any
longer… I swear I haven’t!</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: But you had!</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with
you. I have no business in Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: I think so too.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I want to see a friend of mine… a very dear
friend…. It’s a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or
social philosophies…. It’s a girl.</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: So it’s love which drags you to
Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: No visa.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I must get into that country of yours!</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Oh no. No visa.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: That’s impossible! Nobody has the right…. You
can’t do that!… If you don’t give me that visa…</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: You’re going to force us… huh?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Now look here… you advertise all over the
world that you want people to go into your country and when someone
tries to get in, you keep him out!</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Why should I take a chance?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: On what?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: How do I know you don’t want to blow up a
factory?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: What for… why?</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: Or a tunnel or a bridge…</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Suspicions… nothing but suspicions!… That’s
the trouble with you! If you don’t let me in I’ll stand in front of this
office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!… I’ll picket
your whole country….</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I’ll boycott you, that’s what I’m going to
do!… No more vodka… no more caviar… no more Tchaikovsky… no more
borscht…. Wait a minute, I know something better than that…</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: And you can tell the Kremlin that’s just the
beginning!</p>
<p><strong>official</strong>: No visa.</p>
<p><strong>radio announcer</strong>: March, march, march! Comrades of
the World, never has there been such a May Day parade as this! Already
for four hours the pavements of Moscow have resounded to the tread of a
million boots! Thousands of gun- carriages have thundered past.
Thousands of tanks, combined with our mighty air force, have
demonstrated to a belligerent neighbor that we are ready and invincible!
Now past me marches the great army of our civilians! Men and women of
all ages. All servants of the State united in one thought and ideal.
Group of Several Units Marching</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Good evening, Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Good evening, Ninotchka.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Aren’t you late?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on
account of the parade.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Didn’t you march?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: They didn’t let me. I am in disgrace. Last
week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor
got so excited he yelled, “There’s sabotage in the string section!”</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Too bad… you missed an inspiring day,
Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I know… my heart is sad… but my feet are
happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I
sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.
Are you expecting someone?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: A few friends… just a little dinner
party.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What are you serving?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: An omelet.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: An omelet! Aren’t you living a little above
your ration?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Well, I’ve saved up two eggs and each of
my friends is bringing his own so we’ll manage.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It just goes to prove the theory of our State.
If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you’re true to the
collective spirit and stick together you’ve got an omelet. That reminds
me… have you heard the latest they’re telling about the Kremlin?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’ll tell you later. That Gurganov, you never
know whether he’s on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You should be more careful, Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And you too, Ninotchka.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Ever since you have been back from Paris…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I haven’t talked to anyone about Paris. I
haven’t said a word.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s just it. It makes people feel queer. I
dont’ want you to get in any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I have nothing to hide.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You should. I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: When I passed through the laundry yard today I
saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things
like this create a bad feeling. First they didn’t know whose it was.
Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said
it’s what we all ought to wear and others said it’s like hanging foreign
ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You know how it is today… all you have to do
is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of
counter-revolution.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Thank you, Anna. I’ll dry it up here when
I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my
underwear.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can
trust me…. Did you bring back anything else?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No, I left everything in Paris. I just
happened to be wearing this.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Tell me… what else did you have?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Well, a hat…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What was it like?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It was very silly…. I would be ashamed to
wear it here.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: An evening gown.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Evening gown?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: A dress you wear in the evening.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What do you wear in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: When you get up you put on a negligee,
and then you change to a morning frock.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You mean to tell me you wear a different dress
for different times of the day?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Now, Ninotchka, you’re exaggerating.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No, my dear, it is true. That’s how they
live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered… to
keep warm….</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And there?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Well, sometimes they’re not completely
covered but… they don’t freeze.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: They must have wonderful materials to make a
thing like this so soft… something you don’t even see.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You feel it, though.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Ninotchka, I wouldn’t bring this up if we
weren’t such good friends.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: What is it, Anna?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You know I told you that Pavlov and I are
going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be
asking too much…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You want this?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Just for the honeymoon.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You can have it for good. It is my
wedding present.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Ninotchka! Ninotchka!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Am I going to play that cadenza tonight!</p>
<p><strong>voice on radio</strong>: Individuals? Yes, as atoms in the
cosmos of Soviet Russia. Family? Yes. One great family of one hundred
and sixty million, struggling, fighting, victorious Russian
proletarians. Thus shall we pursue our way into the future, fists
clenched, hearts encased in steel armed against bourgeois sentimentality
and…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No music.</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: Ninotchka! Ninotchka!</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: How are you, you three scoundrels?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Well, we’re back home.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: You know what they say – there’s nothing
like home.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: That’s right… and we might as well face
it.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Come, now, you must not talk that way….
You have to adjust yourselves…. We must be brave.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Brave… that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Let’s be happy that we’re all alive.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: And that’s something we owe to
Ninotchka.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: If you hadn’t given Commissar Razinin such
a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: I can tell you exactly.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Now let’s forget everything except that
we’re together.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Let’s do that.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: It’s a real Paris reunion.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: If you close your eyes and listen to our
voices we might be in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Let’s not close our eyes. There are many
good things to see here too.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: I think I need my glasses.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: A little more tact… look how nicely she’s
fixed the table – all for us.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: trying to make up</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: What a lovely room you have here.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: How many families live here with you?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Only myself and two other girls. One is a
cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Just three people in a room this size?
Whew!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: And your own gas cooker? That’s marvelous!
Naturally it’s not the Royal Suite…</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Sssh! Once and for all, we’re in
Moscow!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Yes, there’s no doubt of that… Just look
out of the window and there it is.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: And it’s great! Think what it was a few
years ago and what it is now.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: She’s right… anyhow let’s talk ourselves
into it.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Just see how happy the people look… from
here….</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Can you blame them?… at least the May Day
parade is over.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: That’s another thing… it’s spring.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: The same spring we had in Paris. Just as
good.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Even the swallows are back.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff and iranoff</strong>: Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Maybe that’s the same swallow we saw in
Paris!</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have
been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a
crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: If you asked him why he left France I bet
he couldn’t name one good reason.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: I should be a swallow! Right now I would
be sitting in front of the Caf� de Paris picking up flakes of French
pastry that would melt in my bill.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Now, comrades… there is something better
in life than crumbs of French pastry.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel….</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: We will get that… we’ll get everything…
maybe a little bit later but we’ll get it… We must be patient… Finally
we got the spring, didn’t we? We got the swallows, and you will get your
apfel strudel too.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: And if it is too late for you your
children will eat it.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Let’s forget the future… let’s stop being
sentimental… let’s start that omelet.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: That’s right. Here’s my egg.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: And here’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Comrades… I’m out of the omelet.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Don’t worry… there will be enough.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Come, Ninotchka, let’s make it in real
Parisian style!</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Let’s fill it with confitures, des
prunes…</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: …des raisins de Mad�re, des
framboises…</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: …des petites fraises des bois… de la cr�me
de Bretagne…</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: …so it blows up that big… what they call
an Omelette Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: And the surprise is there’s nothing in
it.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: I know, but if we can’t put in all these
wonderful things at least let’s put in some imagination. In that one
omelet we’ll taste the whole of Paris!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Sssh!</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: A man like that… all he has to do is to
walk through a room and the omelet drops.</p>
<p><strong>vladimir</strong>: Comrade Yakushova, here, the postman left
a letter for you.</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: What is it, Ninotchka?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: It’s from Paris.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff and buljanoff</strong>: From Paris?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: A bill?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: From Leon.</p>
<p><strong>all three russians</strong>: From Leon!… How is he?… Come,
tell us… open it… tell us… how is he?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Bad news?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Look for yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Well, I think it’s getting late. Good
night, Ninotchka.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Thank you for a wonderful dinner.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Good night, my friends.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: They can’t censor our memories, can
they?</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: Good morning, Comrade.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is
my report on the materials available for trading in the next four
months.</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: Does this include the products of the Far
Eastern provinces?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Yes, it does.</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: You mean you have finished the whole
investigation?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: That’s marvelous…. You must have worked day
and night…. Don’t you ever sleep?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I need very little sleep. We must be
extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started
a survey of our most urgent needs.</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to
turn over that work to someone else.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: May I ask why?</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: Please… sit down.</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: Cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: Well, Comrade, have you heard from your
friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: I haven’t either, but I’ve heard about
them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report
that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have
trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: May I ask what has happened?</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: As soon as our representatives go to a
foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you
what’s going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn’t believe it.
Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven’t sold a
piece of fur. This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the
good name of our country through every caf� and night club. Here… “How
can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three
representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that
they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the
management that it didn’t fly?”</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Oh, they shouldn’t do such things. Are
you sure this report is correct?</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: It gives details which couldn’t be
invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that’s why I need you.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You want me to go to Constantinople?</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: Yes… leaving immediately.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I appreciate the confidence you show in
me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I
should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey
is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have
been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: That is for me to decide, Comrade
Yakushova.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I am sorry, I don’t want to overstep my
position – but please… don’t send me.</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: How can I make myself clear… It is
difficult to express but I’d rather not go to foreign countries any
more. Please, Comrade… let me stay here… let me finish my work… I am in
the rhythm of it now… I don’t want to go away. I don’t want to be sent
into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear…. Let me
finish my work… I have concentrated everything in it… Please… don’t make
me go.</p>
<p><strong>razinin</strong>: Please don’t waste my time, Comrade. Do
your duty. Good-by.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I will do my best.</p>
<p><strong>living room of a very luxurious hotel suite in
constantinople.</strong>: Its style should suggest the locale. Ninotchka
enters with the Three Russians, who are very happy to have her with them
again.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: How do you like it, Ninotchka? Isn’t it
wonderful?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff and buljanoff</strong>: Tell us… tell us.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski…</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Now, please, Ninotchka, don’t start
figuring it out in cows.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You’ve done it again and I am
responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here
to make money, not to spend it.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: Buljanoff, she still has those old-
fashioned Bolshevik ideas.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: It is high time you got out of
Russia.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: do with the three</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: That’s our old Ninotchka!</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff and iranoff</strong>: Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Don’t forget, the day will come when you
will have to face Razinin.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How
does he manage?</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: But, Comrades…</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: of being free again</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Imagine, we don’t have to whisper any
longer.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: We can say whatever we want. We can shout…
we can complain… Look… The service in this hotel is terrible! See?
Nobody comes… nobody pays any attention. That’s freedom.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: No, that’s bad management.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Is it possible to bring you back to
reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations
and a detailed expense account.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Don’t ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a
Turkish proverb which says, “If something smells bad, why put your nose
in it?”</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: And there is a Russian saying: “The cat
who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses.”</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: With our cream situation what it is, it
is Russia which should apologize to the cats.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Friends… friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff…</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: …and Kopalski.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Don’t make it difficult for me. This is
no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: That was our idea when we first came. All
we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but… we
learned better.</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the
country of Aladdin and His Lamp…</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: …Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves… into one
single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: All you have to do is say “open
sesame.”</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: I don’t know how I can get you out of it
this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Shall we tell her?</p>
<p><strong>iranoff and kopalski</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: Ninotchka, I hope you’ll be our
guest.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Guest?</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: We have opened a restaurant…</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: …we have a wonderful electric sign: “Dine
With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski.”</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: You mean you are deserting Russia?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Don’t call it desertion. Our little
restaurant… that is our Russia… the Russia of borscht, the Russia of
beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream…</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: …the Russia of piroshki… people will eat
and love it.</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: We are not only serving good food, we are
serving our country… we are making friends.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Who gave you this idea? What is
responsible for all this?</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: There’s something in Constantinople…
something irresistible….</p>
<p><strong>iranoff</strong>: …it is in the air… it may come around the
corner as you walk down the street….</p>
<p><strong>buljanoff</strong>: …it may step out of a bazaar… it may wait
for you in a corridor… it may hide in the shadow of a minaret….</p>
<p><strong>kopalski</strong>: Right now it’s on the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: They wouldn’t let me in so I had to get you
out.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: So – you’re behind all this. I should
have known.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn’t
be done. Naturally I couldn’t go on forever punching passport officials
in the nose – but I found a way, didn’t I? Darling, I had to see you. I
wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: The one I got they wouldn’t let me read.
It began, “Ninotchka, my darling,” and ended, “Yours, Leon.”</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: I won’t tell you what came between… I’ll prove
it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka… at least a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: But, Leon, I am only here for a few
days.</p>
<p><strong>leon</strong>: If you don’t stay with me, I’ll have to
continue my fight. I’ll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I’ll
turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will
be crowded with Russian restaurants. I’ll depopulate Russia. Once you
saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying
here.</p>
<p><strong>ninotchka</strong>: Well, when it is a choice between my
personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one
shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.</p>
