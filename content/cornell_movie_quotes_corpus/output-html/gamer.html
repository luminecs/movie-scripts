<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Sandra.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>sandra</strong>: Putcher dick away…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Get some.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: we are RUNNING, ragged, full sprint, down a
TUNNEL towards dirty white DAYLIGHT…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Eat shit please.</p>
<p><strong>vroooooosh!!! chukunk, chukunk!! a snowplow barrels
through</strong>: THE DESTRUCTION, pushing the bodies and debris out of
the way and clearing a path, one streaked with crimson red and burnt
flesh. It moves fast and vanishes into the smoke clouds.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Can’t say I didn’t try…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Shit! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>but</strong>: from the level directly below the SNIPER -
through an open doorway - we see a BROWN SOLDIER, BLASTING STRAIGHT UP
THROUGH THE CEILING! The BLUE is BLOWN TO CHUNKS.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Suckage.</p>
<p><strong>blue soldier 1</strong>: Good run, Kable.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: My name’s Tillman.</p>
<p><strong>brown soldier 1</strong>: Whatever your name is. You got to
the save point fast.</p>
<p><strong>brown soldier 2</strong>: So the fuck what? No one’s getting
out of here alive.</p>
<p><strong>blue soldier 1</strong>: I am. I’m going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>brown soldier 2</strong>: Sure you will.</p>
<p><strong>blue soldier 1</strong>: turning his attention to</p>
<p>****: They say you only got three battles left til you get out…</p>
<p>**[music**: Aldo Nova, “LIFE IS JUST A FANTASY” kicks in…]</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: the little gunmetal ball is black and
dented on one side - probably the one we saw get knocked out of the air.
There is a PINHOLE GLASS LENS on the other end.</p>
<p><strong>offscreen voice</strong>: Counting down five… four… three…
two…</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: Do we have the damn interview or
don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: We’re cunt hair close -</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: I can’t blow off the Three-Asian War
for “close”.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: All respect, Bob, nobody cares about dead
Orientals… they care about Ken Castle -</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: May I hear from Gina please?</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: OK, Bob? Bob. You realize Castle
has clocked exactly - one - media appearance to date and that was
Walters’ last interview before she died - NINE FUCKING YEARS AGO!</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: Stop menstruating, just tell me we
fucking have it -</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: We fucking have it!</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Burger chili fry?</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: I’ll freak a burger.</p>
<p><strong>note</strong>: this telecast will play much faster than the
page count indicates - hyped up, quick cutting, overlapping dialog,
A.D.D. and hyper-caffeinated.</p>
<p><strong>voiceover</strong>: First… there was society…</p>
<p><strong>switch to</strong>: ROWS OF PEOPLE in front of wall-sized
VIDEO MONITORS, transfixed, doing a kind of sign language with their
hands… JAPANESE lining up around the block… COLLEGE STUDENTS and OFFICE
WORKERS glued to screens…</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: I ain’t complainin’!</p>
<p><strong>voiceover</strong>: Nine months ago, Castle unveiled a new
simulation - one that would take gaming to new heights of thrilling
excess… and controversy</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: Slayers.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Slayers.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: Why isn’t it murder?</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Gina, when was the last time you saw
someone volunteer to be murdered? I’m sure you know that every last one
of our Slayers is a bona fide death row inmate - …each one offered a
chance to participate as an alternative to their sentence. Stay alive
for thirty sessions and get set free… that’s not a bad God damned
deal.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: I see - and has any one of these
men or women ever actually survived long enough to be set free?</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: I’d remind your audience that Slayers
was put together with the full cooperation and approval of the United
States federal government… that the revenue it produces is responsible
for funding our entire prison system - keeping the bad guys behind bars…
and that the prop was voted for by a cock solid 68% of the American
public.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: … in an election tainted by
suspected digital fraud… let’s talk about the so-called generi-cons.</p>
<p><strong>video</strong>: a montage of slayers “civilians” - the bum
shaking a can in the midst of chaos, a group of pedestrians walking
robotically into a wall of flame, store clerks “air-bagging”
groceries…</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: There’s a lot of men and women in prison
that could never cut it as slayers… shouldn’t they have the same
opportunity to roll the dice for a ticket out? Besides - they only need
to survive one session.</p>
<p><strong>video</strong>: the East Indian Female generi-con from the
first battle gets smeared by a truck.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: Right…</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: Mr. Castle - how the hell does it
work?</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Simple.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: Geek, geek, geek - come on,
Castle, you promised us a demonstration.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Did I? You know I seem to recall that -
let’s just see…</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: Oh… my god. So cute.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: You like her? Her name is Gina. She’s a
good little bitch.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: This motherfucker is off the charts.</p>
<p><strong>chief of staff</strong>: You realize he could buy our
network.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Why would he?</p>
<p><strong>24 continued: 24</strong>: PRODUCER</p>
<p><strong>board op</strong>: That’s fuckin scary.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: Isn’t it true that each human
that undergoes the procedure will have a distinct IP address – like a
notebook computer or mobile device?</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Similar, yep. But control is strictly
localized to the parameters of our gaming environments.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: That’s a relief.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: To some, maybe… to some… don’t you
suspect a good many folks wouldn’t mind an itty bit of control?</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: I don’t… um…</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Someone else making all the decisions
for you… no responsibilities, no tough choices… think about it.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: We will, Mr. Castle. We will.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Good little talk.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: My pleasure. Shit, can I tell
you? I CAN. NOT. wait for the next Slayers. Kable has been unbelievable.
His arms are just so… well, I know it’s awful.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Ken Castle wants you to believe that
you are living in a safer, better world. He’s a liar. Mind control is
slavery. We will all be his dog if we allow this evolution to
continue.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Mr. Castle, we have no idea…</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Shush!</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Bypass orbital, reroute from the backup
servers, NOW, for Christ sake, you dirty apes… Sorry, Mr. Castle, we
can’t hard- line a live broadcast. It’s impossible to stop every virus
that sneaks in.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Uh huh. You might wanna oughta let my
boys take a look at your firewall.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: You’re bad.</p>
<p><strong>board op</strong>: He’s good.</p>
<p><strong>porn girl</strong>: Wanna blow off a little steam?</p>
<p><strong>distinctive prisoner</strong>: Fuck him up.</p>
<p><strong>freek</strong>: Kable. Kable.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: My name is Tillman, freak.</p>
<p><strong>freek</strong>: Tillmans, yeah, Tillmans, I knew that, they
said you name’s was Tillmans… just sittin, always sittin, always lookin,
just lookin… like me, I keep my holes down… you got to, man… a dude
inevitably start to break up, start to crack and break up everyday,
never know you gonna die today or live another two, three. You never do
know. All these niggaz gonna snap, snap, snap, one by one, every last
one, all of em. Yeah but not you. Twenty seven battles and three to go…
no one ever got that close before, no one even done ten games without
gettin they brains shot… but Kable, Kable, Kable, he just sittin,
lookin, like he got a plan, he already somewhere else, he on a mission,
nothin’ get in his way, never break, never snap, never say shit, just
take care of his business, niggaz get spooked by that shit. You
spooky.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I killed my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>prisoner</strong>: Master! Master! Master of Puppets I’m
pulling your strings - Twisting your mind and smashing your dreams…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You want to get back to them.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Who’s talking?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sign it.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Sign it… please, Tillman. My son David is
your biggest fan. He prays for you.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Why would anyone want my name?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You don’t even know what’s going on out
there, do you? Damn…</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Wait. How did you get this picture? Have you
seen them?</p>
<p><strong>cut out wide</strong>: KABLE is ant-size and insignificant on
the long, barren field, under a vast grey sky… ALONE.</p>
<p><strong>ted nugent</strong>: Damn, I gonna have to eat you now,
son.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Oh shit… oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Wul hello thar…</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Turn me around God damn it…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: someone has reached the top of the stairs…
KABLE, seen from behind, comes into view crouched by the blown out
window.</p>
<p><strong>finally</strong>: SNAP ZOOM on a reflection in a shard of
HANGING WINDOW GLASS - the outline of a BLUE, raising his gun…</p>
<p><strong>brown soldier</strong>: Who are they… who the fuck are they…
who’s playing us?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Gay… gay… gay… super gay… hm.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Swarmers. The latest innovation from
Browning, this self detonating cartridge offers the widest and deadliest
spray available from a full tracking, cornering ordnance.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Daddy like…</p>
<p><strong>annoying girl</strong>: Simon!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Fan-girl, stop hacking. If I want you unmuted
I’ll unmute you.</p>
<p><strong>annoying girl</strong>: You suck, Simon - you’re going to get
my boyfriend killed before he can get out of jail and fill me up with
his hot seed.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>cute stoned girl</strong>: Simon, I just wanna play you.
Forget about that star-fucker.</p>
<p><strong>annoying girl</strong>: Shut up bitch.</p>
<p><strong>cute stoned girl</strong>: Thanks baby. When can I meet you
for like reals?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What is that? Aaaa.</p>
<p><strong>cute stoned girl</strong>: You like me?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: What’s up, loser?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Hey sissy.</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: Mom says - let me see, go to college, move
the fuck out, and… oh yeah, you’re a sick retard, you’re pathetic, and
you smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Wanna make out?</p>
<p><strong>shelly</strong>: You wish. I can’t wait til they cut you off,
Simian.</p>
<p><strong>twins</strong>: Simon?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>twins</strong>: Oh my god, it’s really you!!!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>twins</strong>: Do you wanna see our tits, Simon?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Uh, sure.</p>
<p><strong>twin 1</strong>: Mmmmm, now that we have your attention,
here’s another offer you can’t refuse.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>twin 2</strong>: Fifty million euros for control of Kable,
instant transfer to the account of your choice.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Question: do I look like I need the money?
We’ve discussed this before - Kable is not for sale.</p>
<p><strong>twin 1</strong>: Baby… make it a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s been real.</p>
<p><strong>music</strong>: Bloodhound Gang, The Bad Touch:</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: a SPARROW is pecking at a hunk of orange
and yellow</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>gorge</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: So what’s your damage?</p>
<p><strong>gorge/angie</strong>: You know, just hanging out. Looking to
meet people.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Lucky you…</p>
<p><strong>dale</strong>: You met me.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: You met me.</p>
<p><strong>gorge/angie</strong>: I’m Nika.</p>
<p><strong>dale/guy</strong>: I’m Dale. I like your fur.</p>
<p><strong>gorge/angie</strong>: Do you want to go somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>dale/guy</strong>: We are somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>female news host</strong>: … a new video prank by the
subversive group humanz caused a nationwide stir today…</p>
<p><strong>female news host</strong>: All contact between Society City
and an estimated quarter of a million players was shut down for over
three hours while Castle techs worked to remove what they described as a
“Satellite Infection”…</p>
<p><strong>news co-host</strong>: Don’t cry for Castle, he can cover
that with the change under his couch cushions…</p>
<p><strong>female news host</strong>: On a personal note - that shit was
fucking freaky.</p>
<p><strong>news co-host</strong>: Oh - I literally pissed myself.</p>
<p><strong>female news host</strong>: Sounds like fun.</p>
<p><strong>news co-host</strong>: Serious, these humanz cocksuckers are
getting out of control, and someone should do something.</p>
<p><strong>female news host</strong>: Moving on to international
headlines…</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: What the hell happened to this one?</p>
<p><strong>lifer</strong>: Look like he escaped.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Back to your Jazzercise, girls…</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Freak.</p>
<p><strong>freek</strong>: Tillmans.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Who the hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>freek</strong>: New dude, new dude… that’s Hackman. They say
he killed a whole mess of people, all kind of people… one day he just
walk up and turn himself in, like he wanna be inside or some shit… never
gonna run out of slayers long as they got that kind of motherfucka run
around kill a mess of people…</p>
<p><strong>hispanic guard</strong>: Hey Kable.</p>
<p><strong>hispanic guard</strong>: Who aims?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hispanic guard</strong>: Who aims… the slayer? Or the
player?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Not much to aiming… it’s just hand/eye
coordination. I’m the hand… someone, somewhere else is the eye.</p>
<p><strong>hispanic guard</strong>: That’s tripped.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Sometimes… they take over - you know,
completely. They move you. Like a robot. But it doesn’t work so good…
that part’s just for show. You can’t really fight that way.</p>
<p><strong>hispanic guard</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: There’s a delay…</p>
<p><strong>hispanic guard</strong>: Yeah, the ping… they talk about
that. The time it takes the slayer to respond to the command… it’s like,
five millisecond ping, eight millisecond ping…</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Whatever you call it. A slice of a second is
the difference between living and dying out there. When the trigger
pulls -</p>
<p><strong>hackman</strong>: Hey. Kable.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Not interested.</p>
<p><strong>hackman</strong>: No. Wait. Look.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Your head ain’t on straight.</p>
<p><strong>hackman</strong>: I’m going to delete you too. On Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Yeah, probably.</p>
<p><strong>hackman</strong>: That’s why they put me here.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: - the fuck did you say?</p>
<p><strong>hackman</strong>: On the outside… oh, I’m sorry - I meant
your pretty girls… You want to get back to them but I’m going to visit
them first…</p>
<p><strong>castle</strong>: He’s so perfect.</p>
<p><strong>castle 2</strong>: He’s scary.</p>
<p><strong>castle</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>castle 2</strong>: But they love Kable.</p>
<p><strong>castle 3</strong>: He’s right.</p>
<p><strong>castle</strong>: They do now. But when my boy kills their
hero right there in front of their eyeballs, so vivid it’s like you can
reach out and feel the wet flesh - Trust me, they’ll change their point
of view.</p>
<p><strong>castle 2</strong>: How can you be sure?</p>
<p><strong>castle</strong>: It’s human nature. They’ll be seduced by the
power, the violence… the dominance…</p>
<p><strong>castle 3</strong>: Guess we never figured on Kable blowing up
as big as he did.</p>
<p><strong>castle</strong>: Bigger than the game? No. Then again, who
ever would’ve imagined a player could last over a dozen sessions with
the same I-con…</p>
<p><strong>castle 2</strong>: Tillman is a perfect soldier, a tactical
killing computer - you dropped him in with common murderers. What did
you expect?</p>
<p><strong>castle 3</strong>: His instincts give him an edge.</p>
<p><strong>castle 2</strong>: And in the hands of a talented player…</p>
<p><strong>castle 3</strong>: Of course we can never let him out. Not
after what we did to him.</p>
<p><strong>castle 2</strong>: Tell me again why we don’t just get rid of
the problem… You know, off camera?</p>
<p><strong>castle</strong>: YOU - lack a flair for marketing. The people
would never accept that. They need to SEE their gladiators brought
down.</p>
<p><strong>castle 3</strong>: One thing I know is what makes people
tick.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Kable, dude. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Simon. I’m playing you, dummy.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: How come I can hear you?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s a mod.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Gamers can’t talk to cons.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s cool, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: No. Pay attention to the game.</p>
<p><strong>blue soldier 4</strong>: This is real, this is real, this is
real!!!!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: That was sick.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Wait a minute… are you twelve?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I’m nineteen.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Bullshit. This is unbelievable. How am I not
dead yet?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Cause I’m a badass motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>freek</strong>: Gotta keep my holes down… keep `em down.
Freek’s gonna make it, gonna cut, gonna scatter… gonna burn this
joint…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Gibs.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Like, giblets. Kibbles and bits. Chunks.
Pieces.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: These are real humans, fucker.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Death row psychos, so what? They had it
coming.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Guess that goes for me too.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah, but you’re different.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Different how?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Dude, I don’t know. Cause you’re MY
psycho.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Damn, new area.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: That way.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Think about it, Kable: all the shit we’ve
been through together. What an epic run. It’s going to suck to see it
end.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Well, yeah - I get that for you it’s
different.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: We should go that way.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: There’s nothing there.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Kid, trust me - I was going house to house in
Tehran while you were still sucking mommy’s nipple.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Uh, yeah dude, thanks for the visual, but
it’s a restricted area. It’s beyond the borders of the game. I couldn’t
put you there if I tried.</p>
<p><strong>close range</strong>: a big ass armor piercing MORTAR SHELL
PASSES IN</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: … shit shit shit!</p>
<p><strong>hackman</strong>: Bye Kable.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Kid’s gonna get me killed.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Listen to me. I don’t know who’s behind it,
or why, but I was supposed to die today. They’re gunning for us. I can
beat them, but not with you controlling me.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Turn me loose, kid. You want to win, turn me
loose.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: But-</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Find a way.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: same room, later. ANGIE sits on the unmade
bed. She searches through her purse for a PILL JAR, rattles a few into
her hand… she DRY SWALLOWS them… leans forward, eyes shut, struggling
NOT TO PASS OUT… she has to pull herself together somehow… the CAMERA
pushes past her, toward the window, where the ANIMATED COLORS play
24-7…</p>
<p><strong>free</strong>: And then:</p>
<p><strong>caseworker</strong>: So… Miss Roth.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Delia. Her name is Delia.</p>
<p><strong>caseworker</strong>: Spouse incarcerated, life without
possibility of parole. You use your maiden name.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: My husband - he… it’s not entirely true,
regarding his sentence. In fact, he’s due to be released soon…</p>
<p><strong>caseworker</strong>: Your husband was charged and convicted
of first degree murder, Miss Roth. I can hardly consider his release, if
it was to occur, to be a positive.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: I work in society.</p>
<p><strong>caseworker</strong>: Acting, is that what they call it?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: It’s a job.</p>
<p><strong>caseworker</strong>: Miss Roth. Your child has been…
exceedingly well placed. The new family is very wealthy. She’ll never
want for anything. I understand you love your little girl, but… do you
really think she’d be better off with people like you?</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Yes, I do. I’m her mother.</p>
<p><strong>caseworker</strong>: We will give your application all the
consideration that it merits.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: You like the software?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Software…</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: The walkie talkie, playa.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: No shit… you’re the guy from TV. The
HUMANZ.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: That’s right, baby. You think about
what the brotha said?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: To what, um, brotha do you refer… brotha?</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Kable wants the freedom to ass-
kick. Do shit his way. You gonna give it to him?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: You were listening.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: We see and hear everything that goes
on inside the so-called game.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Alright, then. Kable said we got lucky - that
they were gunning for us - what was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Kable got a past… he knows things.
Things he don’t even know he know.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Huh? What things?</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Things Castle’s afraid of. As long
as your boy stay on the inside Castle know he can keep him quiet - but
if ever got out… Uh uh. Castle will never let that happen.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: One battle left, I think I can handle my
bidness.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: You’re not hearing me - this is not
something you can control. They gonna kill his ass, Simon. In the eyes
of the world. And then what? You just another poor little rich honky. No
Kable, no pussy, no shit.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: This is, come on… too heavy… I don’t know
what the hell you’re talking about… I just play games, man. Games.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Mm hm. That’s right, it’s a game.
You want to win it, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah, dude, I intend to.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Then you need to cutcho strings,
puppet-massa.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: That… would be cheating.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: A mod, that’s all. Like that
guidance system you hacked on three weeks ago lets you track
motherfuckers around corners and shit.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Uhhh…</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: The game got to mutate, after all.
It got to evolve, you feel me?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I do. I do feel you.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Then let’s rock, baby.</p>
<p>**[music**: TWISTED SISTER, “I WANNA ROCK” kicks in]</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Tillman.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: We know you talked to him… your Player.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: You’re not a guard… who are you?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: A friend.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I don’t have any.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Listen to me: Simon’s going to give you what
you want. What you asked him for.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I know something else: whether or not he’s
controlling you, you will never reach the save point. Castle won’t allow
it.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No. Listen to me, Tillman - the game is
unwinnable - they will not let you live. If you’re want to get out and
see the people in the picture you’ll have to find another way.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I need you to get me something.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: What, Kable… what can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Drunk.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: What’s he got there?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I can see turning you loose was a great
idea.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: What happened.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: YOU happened, jackass. You wanted control,
you got it.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: No shit…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah, that’s right. So please don’t fuck
up…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: What’s the matter with you Kable? Kill
something!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Fuck it.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Blow me.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Dammit!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Kable. Dude. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Yeah? Anything else ya fuckin
cheerleader?</p>
<p><strong>hackman</strong>: Fuuuuck!!!!</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Kable, PLEASE… get back in the game! YOU’RE
SCREWING MY ASS,</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Um.</p>
<p><strong>without warning</strong>: a SNOWPLOW comes blasting out of
nowhere going 80, trying to ram the driver’s side… it’s a tick late,
clipping the back end instead, sending KABLE into a SPIN… KABLE is
knocked around in the cab and PUKES all over the passenger seat. He
recovers, straightens out and keeps going.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Ughh, that was the one.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Shit, shit, SHIT!</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Please stand by… Please stand by…
Please stand by…</p>
<p><strong>frat guy</strong>: What just happened?</p>
<p><strong>female news host</strong>: To recap: initial reports are that
Kable, the most recognizable face of the Slayers phenomenon next to Ken
Castle himself - is officially listed as fragged…</p>
<p><strong>news co-host</strong>: That’s bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>female news host</strong>: … just one session away from being
the first slayer ever to win a full pardon and release.</p>
<p><strong>female news host</strong>: In a NETCAST plagued by technical
difficulties and dead spots the report could NOT be confirmed - however
KABLE - born John Tillman of Albany, New York and convicted of murder
just four years ago - has been removed from Slayers rosters and upcoming
events listings.</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: She’s not home.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: You asked me that once before.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Your voice…</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: You should really come with me…</p>
<p><strong>3d-id</strong>: novelty toy</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: You a fool.</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Stop playing that freaky shit off the
rail.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: It’s a game of deception.</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Whatever, that’s cuz you got no
power…</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: You guys suck.</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Kable. Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: His name’s Tillman.</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Whatever. You made it. You’re really
here.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: You’re the ones who broke me out?</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: We only freed your mind.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Your ass followed.</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Hey, Kable…</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: You got questions.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: A few.</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: The nanex modifies the actual cell
structure of your brain…</p>
<p><strong>117 continued: 117</strong>: HUMANZ DUDE</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Alright. Why me?</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Because Castle’s scared of you.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: It ain’t just a game, you know,
Tillman. Everyday there’s more people steppin forward, wanna be a part
of Castle’s world. Throwing away everything it means to be human.</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: Right now it’s the desperate ones… convicts,
addicts… the sick, the poor… the ones that fell through the cracks… they
have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: But this is only the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Think about it: the federal prison
system is growing out of control, set to bankrupt the whole damn USA…
Castle rides in on a white horse, says he got a plan to bail us out and
everyone just fall in line.</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: So what’s next? The health care system is
collapsing - Castle comes to the rescue again…</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: This time he’s pushin total control
of genetic disease… birth defects a thing of the past… all we gotta do
is exchange our cells for the ones he wanna give us.</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: The promise of a longer life and a fatter
wallet - you think people will refuse?</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Hell no.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: They’ll be standing in line to hand
their babies over to him. Next thing you know, we all slaves.</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: We can’t let that happen.</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Gotta bring the man down.</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: You can help us, Tillman. You have to help
us.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Tillman.</p>
<p><strong>agent keith</strong>: Guess you remember that day.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Good times.</p>
<p><strong>agent keith</strong>: Sure. On the outside. Now look at
these.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Yeah, um… I need something too.</p>
<p><strong>agent keith</strong>: Do you now? And what might that be?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Could you dudes do a sandwich like: peanut
butter, almond butter, walnut butter… pecan butter, pistachio butter…
pretty much any kind of, you know, nut butter. And Welch’s grape.</p>
<p><strong>agent keith</strong>: Pistachio. They make that?</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: It’s awesome.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: The usual?</p>
<p><strong>rick rape</strong>: Hi Nika.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Oh. Hi. Rick Rape, right?</p>
<p><strong>rick rape</strong>: That was just last month. I was a bad
boy.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: Are you still a bad boy?</p>
<p><strong>rick rape</strong>: Urkk.</p>
<p><strong>gorge/angie</strong>: Please don’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Don’t say that.</p>
<p>****: God damn it… YOU - in there… controlling her… let her talk,
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>gorge/angie</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: You can hear me, baby. I know you can.</p>
<p><strong>gorge/angie</strong>: I love you too.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I’m going to take you someplace where they
can turn it off… the program…</p>
<p><strong>hackman</strong>: Hi, Kable.</p>
<p><strong>hackman</strong>: Anybody in there?</p>
<p><strong>gorge/angie</strong>: Come on… do it…</p>
<p><strong>continuous shot</strong>: GORGE/ANGIE starts running across
the street, leading the way;</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: You. Run.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: I can get you out.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: I can’t believe it’s you. This
is… Listen: you can trust me, Kable.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: If not…</p>
<p><strong>close-up</strong>: a LANCET is prepared… it PUNCTURES SKIN
and</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: The crack works - you’re the proof… we
put the DNA in the soup, light it up, extract it - then feed my girl’s
sequence into the code and we’re good to go.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: It’s an anti-spyware program.</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Basically. We can’t quarantine the
foreign cells per se but we can disable their ability to transmit and
receive.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: Fuck that. I’d make you cut it
out of me.</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: That would be like cutting out part of your
brain.</p>
<p><strong>136 continued: 136</strong>: TRACE</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: How long will she sleep?</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: We’re going to have to keep her sedated until
we can kill the link… otherwise she’s broadcasting everything she sees
or hears.</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Thirty minutes… you give us a robot, we
give you back a super hot human.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Tillman.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: So talk.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Ken Castle made his first billion
designing virtual reality simulators for the US military. Six years ago
he brought them something new - a breakthrough so profound, he said,
that history would be divided up between everything before and
everything that came after.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Yeah. He was.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: The second was you.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: The idea was to replace your brain, bit by
bit, cell by cell, gradual… the new tissue would never break down, never
deteriorate. A new era in human longevity is what they told us. We were
doing the world a favor.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Nine weeks later Scotch was dead and
you were serving life in maximum. Castle’s project was shut down… but
the shit wasn’t a total loss: the same technology resurfaced within a
year… in a game. Castle called it society.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Thank you for the history lesson.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: Dig me, Tillman. Whatever happened
in that project is something Castle wanna be buried. We need that shit,
baby: what you saw, what you know.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I don’t know what to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: You ain’t gotta tell me shit,
Tillman. I want you to show me.</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: Alright. We’re ready to rock.</p>
<p><strong>gorge</strong>: Hooz there?</p>
<p><strong>geek leader</strong>: Tech support.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: What are we looking at?</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: His memories… translated as raw
audiovisual data.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: I read something about this. But
that tech is supposed to be a decade away…</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Current exponential rate of growth, I
can’t imagine a piece of tech that will take that long to come
around.</p>
<p><strong>scotch</strong>: Tillman. Never thought I’d be so glad to see
your ugly grille.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Scotch.</p>
<p><strong>scotch</strong>: Scotch. I’ll tell you what man: this place
sucks.</p>
<p><strong>scotch</strong>: They got me hooked up to computers five
hours a day… nurses feeding me vitamins, giving me shots, wiping my butt
- male nurses, I might add…</p>
<p><strong>scotch</strong>: What about you? You’re dressed like a
semi-human being… they let you out already?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I’m not getting out.</p>
<p><strong>ok.</strong>: Tillman… dude. Are you good?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>scotch</strong>: Uh huh. You don’t look good.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>scotch</strong>: Well, it’s not like you ever looked that
good…</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>scotch</strong>: Tillman…</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I can’t stop it… can’t…</p>
<p><strong>scotch</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>humanz dude</strong>: Not the best commercial for K-soft
technology.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: You can say that again.</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: He made him do it. Castle made him do it.</p>
<p><strong>humanz brother</strong>: A test.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: It’s you.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: I missed you… so much…</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Delia.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: I couldn’t stop them.</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: Nobody could.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: I’m sorry, Tillman. Guess he needed an
insurance policy. She’s with Castle.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: Tillman!</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: That’s all the story you’re going to get.</p>
<p><strong>just then</strong>: matching BLACK SUVs pull up to the curb
just TEN FEET from where she stands.</p>
<p><strong>agent keith</strong>: Alright, Silverton. Get up and get
out.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>agent keith</strong>: Yeah, ain’t it? Looks like someone up
the chain decided you’re no longer a threat.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: No link… no link.</p>
<p><strong>then</strong>: the sound of DOGS… they come in a PACK, loping
across the lawn - grey, more like WOLVES…</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Delia…</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Not bad for video, eh?</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: they TWIRL A FINGER and the SLAYER SPINS…
kick with TWO FINGERS FOR LEGS and the SLAYER KICKS like a</p>
<p><strong>screen begins to play</strong>: it is footage of the GEEK
SQUAD busting into humanz headquarters and EFFICIENTLY KILLING EVERYONE.
ANGIE is tasered unconscious and dragged away.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: You’re awesome.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Castle.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Kable.</p>
<p><strong>kable ken castle</strong>: I don’t care about you. You don’t
care about me.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: I’ve got to thank you for leading me to
them, by the by - the human- zuzz that is…</p>
<p><strong>158 continued: 158</strong>: KEN CASTLE</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: But mine’s different. Built to send - to
transmit . Whereas every other K-soft cell out there - including the
ones in… your head, Kable - is designed to receive. I think it, you do
it.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Very nice, Castle. So you’ve got an army of
psychotics and deviants to dance around for you.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: You’re thinking small, Kable. But not as
small as me.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: You should’ve let him fight for himself,
Castle - he might’ve had a shot.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: I think you’re missing the point, my
man.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: No, I get it - you’re pulling the strings on
all of this… … which makes my next move pretty easy to figure.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Neglected to mention: my smart boys
reversed that hack those fellas worked for you - easy breezy, once we
had access to their drives…</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Come on, lets boogie woogie rock and
roll.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Ummm.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Biggest, baddest Slayer in the game…
don’t seem like much, does he?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: Just like last time. Remember?</p>
<p><strong>ponytail geek</strong>: There are 2 networks accessing the
same IP address.</p>
<p><strong>geek leader</strong>: Someone on the outside is sending him
commands…</p>
<p><strong>geek</strong>: Working on it…</p>
<p><strong>ken castle</strong>: I think it.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Look at this knife… imagine me sticking it
into your gut… think about it… make it real.</p>
<p><strong>geek leader</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Damn it, kid…</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Are you my Daddy Tillman?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>geek</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: The nanex. Set us free.</p>
<p><strong>geek leader</strong>: True dat.</p>
<p><strong>delia</strong>: Mommy. Why did Daddy Tillman hurt Daddy
Ken?</p>
<p><strong>trace</strong>: This is for you, you dumb bitch. I hope you
do the right thing with it.</p>
<p><strong>gina parker smith</strong>: Oh, baby…</p>
<p><strong>kable</strong>: You good, sweetheart?</p>
