<h1 id="a-few-good-men">a-few-good-men</h1>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: You’re lucky it’s us, Willy.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m requesting… I’m… Captain, I’d like to
request that I be the attorney assigned to rep – I’d like to request
that it be myself who is assigned to represent – “That it be myself who
is assigned to represent”? …Good, Jo, that’s confidence inspiring.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Jo, come on in.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: Captain West, this is Lt. Commander Galloway.
Jo, you know Mike Lawrence.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes sir. Captain, I appreciate your seeing me on
such short notice.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I understand there was some trouble over the
weekend down in Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes sir… This past Friday evening. Two marines,
Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey, entered the barracks
room of a PFC William Santiago and assaulted him. Santiago died at the
base hospital approximately an hour later. The NIS agent who took their
statements maintains they were trying to prevent Santiago from naming
them in a fenceline shooting incident. They’re scheduled to have a
hearing down in Cuba at 4:00 this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Dawson and Downey are both recruiting poster
marines and Santiago was known to be a screw-up. I was thinking that it
sounded an awful lot like a code red.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Christ.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’d like them moved up to Washington and
assigned counsel. Someone who can really look into this. Someone who
possesses not only the legal skill, but a familiarity with the inner
workings of the military. In short, Captain, I’d like to suggest that… I
be the one who, that it be me who is assigned to represent them.
Myself.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Joanne, why don’t you get yourself a cup of
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you, sir, I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Joanne, I’d like you to leave the room so we
can talk about you behind your back.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Certainly, sir.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I thought this Code Red shit wasn’t going on
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: With the marines at GITMO? Who the hell
knows what goes on down there.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Well lets find out before the rest of the
world does, this thing could get messy. What about this woman?</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Jo’s been working a desk at internal
affairs for what, almost a year now.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: And before that?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: She disposed of three cases in two years.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Three cases in two years? Who was she
handling, the Rosenbergs?</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: She’s not cut out for litigation.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: She’s a hall of an investigator, Jerry
–</p>
<p><strong>gibbs</strong>: In Internal Affairs, sure. She can crawl up a
lawyer’s ass with the best of ’em, but when it comes to trial work –</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: I know. All passion, no street smarts. Bring
her back in.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Commander, we’re gonna move the defendants up
here in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: And I’ll have Division assign them
counsel…</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: But… not me.</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: From what I understand from your colleagues,
you’re much too valuable in your present assignment to be wasted on what
I’m sure will boil down to a five minute plea bargain and a week’s worth
of paper work.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Sir –</p>
<p><strong>west</strong>: Don’t worry about it. I promise you,
division’ll assign the right man for the job.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Alright, let’s get two!</p>
<p><strong>second base</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby. Just look
the ball into your glove.</p>
<p><strong>second base</strong>: Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You gotta trust me, Sherby. You keep your
eyes open, your chances of catching the ball increase by a factor of
ten.</p>
<p><strong>spradling</strong>: Kaffee!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Let’s try it again.</p>
<p><strong>spradling</strong>: Kaffee!!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Dave. You seem upset and distraught.</p>
<p><strong>spradling</strong>: We were supposed to meet in your office
15 minutes ago to talk about the McDermott case. You’re stalling on this
thing. Now we got this done and I mean now, or no kidding, Kaffee, I’ll
hang your boy from a fuckin’ yardarm.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: A yardarm? Sherby, does the Navy still hang
people from yardarms?</p>
<p><strong>sherby</strong>: I don’t think so, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Dave, Sherby doesn’t think the Navy hangs
people from yardarms anymore. Let’s go, let’s get two!</p>
<p><strong>spradling</strong>: I’m gonna charge him with possession and
being under the influence while on duty. Plead guilty and I’ll recommend
30 days in the brig with loss of rank and pay.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: It was oregano, Dave, it was ten dollars
worth of oregano.</p>
<p><strong>spradling</strong>: Yeah, well your client thought it was
marijuana.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: My client’s a moron, that’s not against the
law.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Ow. That had to hurt. Way to keep your head
in the play, Lester. Walk it off!</p>
<p><strong>spradling</strong>: I’ve got people to answer to just like
you, I’m gonna charge him.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: With what, possession of a condiment?</p>
<p><strong>spradling</strong>: Kaffee –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Dave, I’ve tried to help you out of this,
but if you ask for tall time, I’m gonna file a motion to dismiss.</p>
<p><strong>spradling</strong>: You won’t got it.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I will get it. And if the MTD is denied,
I’ll file a motion in liminee seeking to obtain evidentiary ruling in
advance, and after that I’m gonna file against pre-trial confinement,
and you’re gonna spend an entire summer going blind on paperwork because
a Signalman Second Class bought and smoked a dime bag of oregano.</p>
<p><strong>spradling</strong>: B Misdemeanor, 20 days in the brig.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: C Misdemeanor, 15 days restricted duty.</p>
<p><strong>spradling</strong>: I don’t know why I’m agreeing to
this.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: ’Cause you have wisdom beyond your years.
Dave, can you play third base?</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: ’Morning.</p>
<p><strong>lawyers</strong>: ’Morning Captain Whitaker.</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: Sam, how’s the baby?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I think she’s ready to say her first word any
day now.</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She just looks like she has something to
say.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Excuse me, sorry I’m late.</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: I’m sure you don’t have a good excuse, so
I won’t force you to come up with a bad one.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Thank you, Isaac, that’s nice of you.</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: Sit-down, this first one’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: You’re moving up in the world, Danny,
you’ve been requested by Division.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Requested to do what?</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. A marine corporal
named Dawson illegally fires a round from his weapon over the fenceline
and into Cuban territory.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What’s a fenceline?</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A big wall separating the good guys from the
bad guys.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Teachers pet.</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: PFC William Santiago threatens to rat on
Dawson to the Naval investigative Service. Dawson and another member of
his squad, PFC Louden Downey, they go into Santiago’s room, tie him up,
and stuff a rag down his throat. An hour later, Santiago’s dead.
Attending physician says the rag was treated with some kind of
toxin.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: They poisoned the rag?</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: Not according to them.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What do they say?</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: Not much. They’re being flown up here
tomorrow and on Thursday at 0600 you’ll catch a transport down to Cuba
for the day to find out what you can. Meantime, go across the yard and
see Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. She’s the one who had ’em brought up
here. She’ll fill you in on whatever she has. Any questions?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The flight to Cuba, was that 0600 in the
morning, sir?</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: It seems important to Division that this
one be handled by the book, so I’m assigning co-counsel. Any
volunteers?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I have a stack of paper on my desk –</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: Work with Kaffee on this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Doing what? Kaffee’ll finish this up in four
days.</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: Do various… administrative… you know…
things. Back-up. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: In other words I have no responsibilities
whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>whitaker</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My kinda case.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Hi. I’m Daniel Kaffee. I was told to meet
with – – Commander Galloway.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: About a briefing.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You’re the attorney that Division assigned?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m lead counsel. This is Sam Weinberg.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I have no responsibilities here whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Come in, please, have a seat…</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Lieutenant, how long have you been in the
Navy?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Going on nine months now.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And how long have you been out of law
school?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: A little over a year.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Have I done something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: No. It’s just that when I petitioned Division to
have counsel assigned, I was hoping I’d be taken seriously.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No offense taken, if you were wondering.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Commander, Lt. Kaffee’s generally considered
the best litigator in our office. He’s successfully plea bargained 44
cases in nine months.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: One more, and I got a set of steak
knives.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Have you ever been in a courtroom?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I once had my drivers license suspended.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Danny –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Commander, from what I understand, if this
thing goes to court, they won’t need a lawyer, they’ll need a
priest.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: No. They’ll need a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Dawson’s family has been contacted. Downey’s
closest living relative is Ginny Miller, his aunt on his mother’s side,
she hasn’t been Contacted yet.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Would you like me to take care of that?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sure, if you feel like it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: One of the people you’ll be speaking to down
there is the barracks C.O., Colonel Nathan Jessep, I assume you’ve heard
of him.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Who hasn’t?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s been in the papers lately. He’s expected
to be appointed Director of Operations for the National Security
Counsel.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: These are letters that Santiago wrote in his 8
months at GITMO –</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I know that one.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He wrote to his recruiter, the fleet commander,
HQ, Atlantic, even his senator. He wanted a transfer. Nobody was
listening. You with me?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: This last letter to the Naval investigative
Service –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: – where he offers information about Corporal
Dawson’s fenceline shooting in exchange for a transfer, was just a last
ditch effort.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Right. Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Lieutenant, this letter makes it look like your
client had a motive to kill Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Gotcha. And Santiago is… who?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: The victim.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Write that down. Am I correct in assuming
that these letters don’t paint a flattering picture of marine corps life
in Guantanamo Bay?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes, among other –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And am I further right in assuming that a
protracted investigation of this incident might cause some embarrassment
for the security counsel guy.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Colonel Jessep, yes, but –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Twelve years.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Twelve years. I can get it knocked down to
Involuntary Manslaughter. Twelve years.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You haven’t talked to a witness, you haven’t
looked at a piece of paper.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Pretty impressive, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You’re gonna have to go deeper than just –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Commander, do you have some sort of
jurisdiction here that I should know about?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: My job is to make sure you do your job. I’m
special counsel for Internal Affairs, so my jurisdiction’s pretty much
in your face. Read the letters. You’re not under any obligation, but I’d
appreciate a report when you get back from Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You’re dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sorry, I always forget that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He’s a little preoccupied. The team’s playing
Bethesda Medical next week.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Tell your friend not to get cute down there. The
marines in Guantanimo are fanatical.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: Dear Sir,</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: About being marines.</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: “…My name is PFC William T. Santiago. I am
a marine stationed at Marine Barracks, Rifle Security Company Windward,
Second Platoon Delta. I am writing to inform you of my problems with my
unit here in Cuba and to ask for your help. I’ve fallen out on runs
before for several reasons such as feeling dizzy or nauseated, but on
May 18th, I’d fallen back about 20 or 30 yards going down a rocky,
unstable hill. My sergeant grabbed me and pushed me down the hill. Then
I saw all black and the last thing I remember is hitting the deck. I was
brought to the hospital where I was told I just had heat exhaustion and
was explained to by the doctor that my body has trouble with the hot sun
and I hyperventilate. I ask you to help me. Please sir. I just need to
be transferred out of RSC. Sincerely. PFC William T. Santiago. U.S.
Marine Corps.”</p>
<p><strong>santiago</strong>: “P.S. In exchange for my transfer off the
base, I’m willing to provide you with information about an illegal
fenceline shooting that occurred the night of August 2nd.”</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Who the fuck is PFC William T. Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Sir, Santiago is a member of Second
Platoon, Delta.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yeah, well, apparently he’s not very happy
down here at Shangri-La, cause he’s written letters to everyone but
Santa Claus asking for a transfer. And now he’s telling tales about a
fenceline shooting.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Matthew?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I’m appalled, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You’re appalled? This kid broke the Chain of
Command and he ratted on a man of his unit, to say nothing of the fact
that he’s a U.S. Marine and it would appear that he can’t run from here
to there without collapsing from heat exhaustion. What the fuck’s going
on over at Windward, Matthew?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Colonel, I think perhaps it would be
better to hold this discussion in private.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: That won’t be necessary, Colonel, I’ll
handle the situation.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: The same way you handled the Curtis
Barnes incident? You’re doing something wrong, Lieutenant this –</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: My methods of leadership are –</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Don’t interrupt me, I’m still your
superior officer.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: And I’m yours, Matthew.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I want to know what we’re gonna do about
this.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I think Santiago should be transferred
off the base. Right away.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: He’s that bad, huh?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Not only that, but word of this letter’s
bound to get out. The kid’s gonna get his ass kicked.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Transfer Santiago. Yes I suppose you’re
right. I suppose that’s the thing to do. Wait. Wait. I’ve got a better
idea. Let’s transfer the whole squad off the base. Let’s – on second
thought – Windward. The whole Windward division, let’s transfer ’em off
the base. Jon, go on out there and get those boys down off the fence,
they’re packing their bags. Tom!</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Got me the President on the phone, we’re
surrendering our position in Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Yes sir!</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Wait a minute, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Don’t call the President just yet. Maybe we
should consider this for a second. Maybe – and I’m just spit balling
here – but maybe we as officers have a responsibility to train Santiago.
Maybe we as officers have a responsibility to this country to see that
the men and women charged with its security are trained professionals.
Yes. I’m certain I once read that somewhere. And now I’m thinking that
your suggestion of transferring Santiago, while expeditious, and
certainly painless, might not be in a manner of speaking, the American
way. Santiago stays where he is. We’re gonna train the lad. You’re in
charge, Jon. Santiago doesn’t make 4.1 on his next fitness report, I’m
gonna blame you. Then I’m gonna kill you.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I think that’s a mistake, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Matthew, I believe I will have that word in
private with you now. Jon, that’s all. Why don’t you and I have lunch at
the “O” club, we’ll talk about the training of young William.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Yes sir, I’d be delighted to hear any
suggestions you have.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Matthew, sit, please.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: What do you think of Kendrick?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I don’t know that –</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I think he’s kind of a weasel, myself. But
he’s an awfully good officer, and in the end we see eye to eye on the
best way to run a marine corps unit. We’re in the business of saving
lives, Matthew. That’s a responsibility we have to take pretty
seriously. And I believe that taking a marine who’s not yet up to the
job and packing him off to another assignment, puts lives in danger.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Matthew, siddown. We go back a while. We
went to the Academy together, we were commissioned together, we did our
tours in Vietnam together. But I’ve been promoted up through the chain
with greater speed and success than you have. Now if that’s a source of
tension or embarrassment for you, well, I don’t give a shit. We’re in
the business of saving lives, Captain Markinson. Don’t ever question my
orders in front of another officer.</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Hal?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Is this Washington, D.C.?</p>
<p><strong>m.p.</strong>: Alright, let’s move.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Alright, let’s get tough out there!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You want to suit up? We need all the help we
can get.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: No, thank you, I can’t throw and catch
things.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: That’s okay, neither can they.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I wanted to talk to you about Corporal Dawson
and Private Downey.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Say again?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Dawson and Downey.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Those names sound like they should mean
something to me, but I’m just not –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Dawson! Downey! Your clients!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The Cuba thing! Yes! Dawson and Downey.
Right. I’ve done something wrong again, haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I was wondering why two guys have been in a jail
cell since this morning while their lawyer is outside hitting a
ball.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We need the practice.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: That wasn’t funny.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: It was a little funny.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Lieutenant, would you feel very insulted if I
recommended to your supervisor that he assign different counsel?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I don’t think you’re fit to handle this
defense.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You don’t even know me. Ordinarily it takes
someone hours to discover I’m not fit to handle a defense.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Oh come on, that was damn funny.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I do know you. Daniel AlliStair Kaffee, born
June 8th, 1964 at Boston Mercy Hospital. Your father’s Lionel Kaffee,
former Navy Judge Advocate and Attorney General, of the United States,
died 1985. You went to Harvard Law on a Navy scholarship, probably
because that’s what your father wanted you to do, and now you’re just
treading water for the three years you’ve gotta serve in the JAG Corps,
just kinda layin’ low til you can get out and get a real job. And if
that’s the situation, that’s fine, I won’t tell anyone. But my feeling
is that if this case is handled in the same fast-food, slick-ass,
Persian Bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else,
something’s gonna get missed. And I wouldn’t be doing my job if I
allowed Dawson and Downey to spend any more time in prison than
absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre- determined the
path of least resistance.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Wow. I’m sexually aroused, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I don’t think your clients murdered anybody.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What are you basing this on?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: There was no intent.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The doctor’s report says that Santiago died
of asphyxiation brought on by acute lactic acidosis, and that the nature
of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning. Now, I don’t know what any
of that means, but it sounds pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Santiago died at one a.m. At three the doctor
was unable to determine the cause of death, but two hours later he said
it was poison.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Oh, now I see what you’re saying. It had to
be Professor Plum in the library with the candlestick.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m gonna speak to your supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Okay. You go straight up Pennsylvania
Avenue. It’s a big white house with pillars in front.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I don’t think you’ll have much luck, though.
I was assigned by Division, remember? Somebody over there thinks I’m a
good lawyer. So while I appreciate your interest and admire your
enthusiasm, I think I can pretty much handle things myself.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Do you know what a code red is?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What a pity.</p>
<p><strong>m.p.</strong>: Officer on deck, ten-hut.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson, sir.
Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon, Delta.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Someone hasn’t been working and playing well
with others, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir, yes sir!</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Sir, PFC Louden Downey.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m Daniel Kaffee, this is Sam Weinerg, you
can sitdown.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Is this your signature?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You don’t have to call me sir. Is this your
signature?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Sir, yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And you certainly don’t have to do it twice
in one sentence. Harold, what’s a Code Red?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir, a Code Red is a disciplinary
engagement.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What does that mean, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir, a marine falls out of line, it’s up to
the men in his unit to get him back on track.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What’s a garden variety Code Red?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Harold, you say sir and I turn around and
look for my father. Danny, Daniel, Kaffee. Garden variety; typical.
What’s a basic Code Red?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir, a marine has refused to bathe on a
regular basis. The men in his squad would give him a G.I. shower.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Scrub brushes, brillo pads, steel wool…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Was the attack on Santiago a Code Red?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Do you ever talk?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir, Private Downey will answer any direct
questions you ask him.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Swell. Private Downey, the rag you stuffed
in Santiago’s mouth, was there poison on it?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Silver polish, turpentine, anti- freeze…</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: No sir. We were gonna shave his head,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: When all of a sudden…?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: We saw blood drippinq out of his mouth. Then
we pulled the tape off, and there was blood all down his face, sir.
That’s when Corporal Dawson called the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did anyone see you call the ambulance?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Were you there when the ambulance got
there?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Yes sir, that’s when we were taken under
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: On the night of August 2nd, did you fire a shot
across the fenceline into Cuba?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: My mirror engaged, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: His mirror engaged?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: For each American sentry post there’s a Cuban
counterpart. They’re called mirrors. The corporal’s claiming that his
mirror was about to fire at him.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Santiago’s letter to the NIS said you fired
illegally. He’s saying that the guy, the mirror, he never made a
move.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Oh, Harold?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You see what I’m getting at? If Santiago
didn’t have anything on you, then why did you give him a Code Red?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Because he broke the chain of command,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: He what?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: He went outside his unit, sir. If he had a
problem, he should’ve spoken to me, sir. Then his Sergeant, then Company
Commander, then –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yeah, yeah, alright. Harold, did you assault
Santiago with the intent of killing him?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What was your intent?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: To train him, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Train him to do what?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Train him to think of his unit before
himself. To respect the code.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s the code?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Unit Corps God Country.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Unit Corps God Country, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The Goverrment of the United States wants to
charge you two with murder. You want me to go to the prosecutor with
unit, corps, god, country?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: That’s our code, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We’ll be back. You guys need anything? Books
paper, cigarettes, a ham sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir. No thank you. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Harold, I think there’s a concept you better
start warming up to.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m the only friend you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Dan Kaffee.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sailin’ Jack Ross.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Welcome to the big time.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I hope for Dawson and Downey’s sake you
practice law better than you play softball.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Unfortunately for Dawson and Downey, I don’t
do anything better than I play softball. What are we lookin’ at?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: They plead guilty to manslaughter, I’ll drop
the conspiracy and the conduct unbecoming. 20 years, they’ll be home in
half that time.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I want twelve.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: They called the ambulance, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I don’t care if they called the Avon Lady,
they killed a marine.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The rag was tested for poison. The autopsy,
lab report, even the initial E.R. and C.O.D. reports. They all say the
same thing: Maybe, maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: The Chief of Internal Medicine at the
Guantanamo Bay Naval hospital says he’s sure.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What do you know about Code Reds?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Oh man.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Are we off the record?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I’m gonna give you the twelve years, but
before you go getting yourself into trouble tomorrow, you should know
this: The platoon commander Lt. Jonathan Kendrick, had a meeting with
the men. And he specifically told them not to touch Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ll talk to you when I get back.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Hey, we got a little four-on-four going
tomorrow night. When does your plane get in?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Any luck getting me replaced?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Is there anyone in this command that you don’t
either drink or play softball with?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Commander –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Listen, I came to make peace. We started off on
the wrong foot. What do you say? Friends?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Look, I don’t –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: By the way, I brought Downey some comic books he
was asking for. The kid, Kaffee, I swear, he doesn’t know where he is,
he doesn’t even know why he’s been arrested.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Commander –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You can call me Joanne.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Joanne –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: or Jo.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo, if you ever speak to a client of mine
again without my permission, I’ll have you disbarred. Friends?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I had authorization.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: From where?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Downey’s closest living relative, Ginny Miller,
his aunt on his mother’s side.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You got authorization from Aunt Ginny?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I gave her a call like you asked. Very nice
woman, we talked for about an hour.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You got authorization from Aunt Ginny.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Perfectly within my province.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Does Aunt Ginny have a barn? We can hold the
trial there. I can sew the costumes, and maybe his Uncle Goober can be
the judge.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m going to Cuba with you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And the hits just keep on comin’.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: How’s it goin’, Luther?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Another day, another dollar, captain.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You gotta play ’em as they lay, Luther.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: What comes around, goes around, you know
what I’m sayin’.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: If you can’t beat ’em, join ’em.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Hey, if you’ve got your health, you got
everything.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Love makes the world go round. I’ll see you
tomorrow, Luther.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: When Nancy gets back, you’re my witness. The
baby spoke. My daughter said a word.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Your daughter made a sound, Sam, I’m not
sure it was a word.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Oh come on, it was a word.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You heard her. The girl sat here, pointed, and
said “Pa”. She did. She said “Pa”.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: She was pointing at a doorknob.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s right. Pointing, as if to say, “Pa,
look, a doorknob”.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jack Ross came to see me today. He offered
me twelve years.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s what you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I know, and I’ll… I guess, I mean – I’ll
take it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: It took albout 45 seconds. He barely put up
a fight.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Danny, take the twelve years, it’s a gift.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You don’t believe their story, do you? You
think they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I believe every word they said. And I think
they ought to go to jail for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Remember to wear your whites, it’s hot down
there.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I don’t like the whites.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nobody likes the whites, but we’re going to
Cuba in August. You got Dramamine?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Dramamine keeps you cool?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Dramamine keeps you from throwing up, you get
sick when you fly.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I get sick when I fly because I’m afraid of
crashing into a large mountain, I don’t think Dramamine’ll help.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve got some oregano, I hear that works pretty
good.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You know, Ross said the strangest thing to
me right before I left. He said the platoon commander Lieutenant
Jonathan Kendrick had a meeting with the men and specifically told them
not to touch Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I never mentioned Kendrick. I don’t even
know who he is. What the hell. I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Commander Galloway.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I’m Corporal Howard, ma’am, I’m to escort
you to the Windward side of the base.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I’ve got some camouflage jackets in the back
of the jeep, sirs, I’ll have to ask you both to put them on.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Camouflage jackets?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Regulations, sir. We’ll be riding pretty
close to the fenceline. The Cubans see an officer wearing white, they
think it’s someone they might wanna take a shot at.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Good call, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: We’ll just hop on the ferry and be over
there in no time.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Whoa! Hold it! We gotta take a boat?!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yes sir, to get to the other side of the
bay.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Nobody said anything about a boat.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Is there a problem, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No. No problem. I’m just not that crazy
about boats, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Jesus Christ, Kaffee, you’re in the Navy for
cryin’ out loud!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Nobody likes her very much.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Nathan Jessep, come on in and siddown.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Thank you. I’m Daniel Kaffee, I’m the
attorney for Dawson and Downey. This is Joanne Galloway, she’s observing
and evaluating –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Pleased to meet you, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sam Weinberg. He has no responsibility here
whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I’ve asked Captain Markinson and Lt.
Kendrick to join us.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Lt. Kaffee, I had the pleasure of seeing
your father once. I was a teenager and he spoke at my high school.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Lionel Kaffee?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Well what do you know. Son, this man’s dad
once made a lot of enemies down in your neck of the woods. Jefferson
vs. Madison County School District. The folks down there said a little
black girl couldn’t go to an all white school, Lionel Kaffee said we’ll
just see about that. How the hell is your dad?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: He passed away seven years ago, colonel.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Well… don’t I feel like the fuckin,
asshole.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Not at all, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Well, what can we do for you, Danny.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Not much at all, sir, I’m afraid. This is
really a formality more than anything else. The JAG Corps insists that I
interview all the relevant witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: The JAG Corps can be demanding that way.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Jonanthan’ll take you out and show you what
you wanna see, then we can all hook up for lunch, how does that
sound?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Fine, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I understand you had a meeting with your men
that afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What’d you guys talk about?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: I told the men that there was an informer
among us. And that despite any desire they might have to seek
retribution, Private Santiago was not to be harmed in any way.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What time was that meeting?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Sixteen-hundred.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sam, somebody should see about getting this
stuff to his parents. We don’t need it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Actually, the uniforms belong to the
marine corps.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lt. Kendrick – can I call you Jon?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: No, you may not.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Have I done something to offend you?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: No, I like all you Navy boys. Every time
we’ve gotta go someplace and fight, you fellas always give us a
ride.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Lt. Kendrick, do you think Santiago was
murdered?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Commander, I believe in God, and in his
son Jesus Christ, and because I do, I can say this: Private Santiago is
dead and that’s a tragedy. But he’s dead because he had no code. He’s
dead because he had no honor. And God was watching.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How do you feel about that theory?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sounds good. Let’s move on.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You planning on doing any investigating or are
you just gonna take the guided tour?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m pacing myself.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: …And they spent the next three hours running
around, looking for Americans to surrender to.</p>
<p>****: That was delicious, men, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>steward</strong>: Our pleasure, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Colonel just need to ask you a couple of
questions about August 6th.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: On the morning of the sixth, you were
contacted by an NIS angent who said that Santiago had tipped him off to
an illegal fenceline shooting.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Santiago was gonna reveal the person’s name
in exchange for a transfer. An I getting this right?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: If you feel there are any details that I’m
missing, you should free to speak up.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Now it was at this point that you called
Captain Markinson and Lt. Kendrick into your office?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And what happened then?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: We agreed that for his own safety, Santiago
should be transferred off the base.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Santiago was set to be transferred?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: On the first available flight to the states.
Six the next morning. Three hours too late as it turned out.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Alright, that’s all I have. Thanks very much
for your time.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: The corporal’s got the jeep outside, he’ll
take you back to the airstrip.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Wait a minute, I’ve got some questions.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Colonel, on the morning that Santiago died, did
you meet with Doctor Stone between three and five?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo –</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Of course I met with the doctor. One of my
men was dead.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: See? The man was dead. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I was wondering if you’ve ever heard the term
Code Red.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo –</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I’ve heard the term, yes.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Colonel, this past February, you received a
cautionary memo from the Naval Investigative Service, warning that the
practice of enlisted men disciplining their own wasn’t to be condoned by
officers.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I submit to you that whoever wrote that memo
has never served on the working end of a Soviet-made Cuban Ml-Al6
Assault Rifle. However, the directive having come from the NIS, I gave
it its due attention. What’s your point, Jo?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: She has no point. She often has no point.
It’s part of her charm. We’re outta here. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: My point is that I think code reds still go on
down here. Do Code Reds still happen on this base, colonel?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo, the colonel doesn’t need to answer
that.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes he does.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No, he really doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yeah, he really does. Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You know it just hit me. She outranks you,
Danny.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I want to tell you something Danny and
listen up ’cause I mean this: You’re the luckiest man in the world.
There is, believe me gentlemen, nothing sexier on earth than a woman you
have to salute in the morning. Promote ’em all I say.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Colonel, the practice of code Reds is still
condoned by officers on this base, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You see my problem is, of course, that I’m a
Colonel. I’ll just have to keep taking cold showers ’til they elect some
gal President.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I need an answer to my question, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Take caution in your tone, Commander. I’m a
fair guy, but this fuckin’ heat’s making me absolutely crazy. You want
to know about code reds? On the record I tell you that I discourage the
practice in accordance with the NIS directive. Off the record I tell you
that it’s an invaluable part of close infantry training, and if it
happens to go on without my knowledge, so be it. I run my base how I run
my base. You want to investigate me, roll the dice and take your
chances. I eat breakfast 80 yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained
to kill me. So don’t for one second think you’re gonna come down here,
flash a badge, and make me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Let’s go. Colonel, I’ll just need a copy of
Santiago’s transfer order.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Santiago’s transfer order. You guys have
paper work on that kind of thing, I just need it for the file.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: For the file.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Of course you can have a copy of the
transfer order. For the file. I’m here to help anyway I can.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You believe that, don’t you? Danny? That I’m
here to help anyway I can?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: The corporal’ll run you by Ordinance on your
way out to the airstrip. You can have all the transfer orders you
want.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: But you have to ask me nicely.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You have to ask me nicely. You see, Danny, I
can deal with the bullets and the bombs and the blood. I can deal with
the heat and the stress and the fear. I don’t want money and I don’t
want medals. What I want is for you to stand there in that faggoty white
uniform, and with your Harvard mouth, extend me some fuckin’ courtesy.
You gotta ask me nicely.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Colonel Jessep… if it’s not too much
trouble, I’d like a copy of the transfer order. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I hate casualties, Matthew. There are
casualties even in victory. A marine smothers a grenade and saves his
platoon, that marine’s a hero. The foundation of the unit, the fabric of
this base, the spirit of the Corps, they are things worth fighting
for.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Dawson and Downey, they don’t know it, but
they’re smothering a grenade.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ve really missed you, Jo. I was just
saying to myself, “It’s been almost three hours since I last saw –”</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Markinson resigned his commission.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: This afternoon. Sometime after we left.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ll talk to him in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I already tried, I can’t find him.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You tried? Joanne, you’re coming dangerously
close to the textbook definition of interfering with a government
investigation.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m Louden Downey’s attorney.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Aunt Ginny. She said she feels like she’s known
me for years. I suggested that she might feel more comfortable if I were
directly involved with the case. She had Louden sign the papers about an
hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I suppose it’s way too much to hope that
you’re just making this up to bother me.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m not gonna make a motion for
separation, you’re still lead counsel.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Splendid.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red. So do
you.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Officer on deck, ten hut.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did Kendrick order the code red?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Don’t say sir like I just asked you if you
cleaned the latrine. You heard what I said. Did Lt. Kendrick order you
guys to give Santiago a code red?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did he?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You mind telling me why the hell you never
mentioned this before?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: You didn’t ask us, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Cutie-pie shit’s not gonna win you a place
in my heart, corporal, I get paid no matter how much time you spend in
jail.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Yes sir. I know you do, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Fuck you, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Alright. Let’s sort this out. There was a
platoon meeting on August 6th at four in the afternoon. And Lt.
Kendrick, he gave strict instructions that nothing was to happen to
Santiago. Now is that true? I want you to speak freely.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Ma’am, that’s correct. But then he dismissed
the platoon and we all went to our rooms.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And what happened then?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Lt. Kendrick came to our room, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: About five minutes after the meeting broke,
sir. About 16:20.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And what happened then?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Lt. Kendrick ordered us to give Santiago a
Code Red.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jack!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jack!!</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Hang on…</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: They were given an order.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: How long have you known about the order?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I didn’t – Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: This is Jo Galloway she’s Downey’s lawyer.
She’s very pleased to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What exactly are you accusing me of,
commander?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m accusing you of –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jack didn’t know about the order. Because if
he did and he hadn’t told us, Jack knows he’d be violating about 14
articles of the code of ethics. As it is, he’s got enough to worry
about. God forbid our clients decide to plead not guilty and testify for
the record that they were given an order.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Kendrick specifically told the men not to
touch Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: That’s right. And then he went into Dawson
and Downey’s room and specifically told them to give him a code red.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: That’s not what Kendrick said.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Kendrick’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: You have proof?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I have the defendants.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: And I have 23 marines who aren’t accused of
murder and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Why did Markinson resign his commission?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: We’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You don’t think I can subpoena
Markinson.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: You can try, but you won’t find him. You know
what Markinson did for the first 17 of his 21 years in the corps?
Counter Intelligence. Markinson’s gone. There is no Markinson.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Jessep’s star is on the rise. Division’ll give
me a lot of room to spare Jessep and the corps any embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: How much room?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I’ll knock it all down to assault. Two years.
They’re home in six months.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: No deal, we’re going to a jury.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo –</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: ’Cause you’ll lose, and Danny knows it. And he
knows that if we go to court, I’ll have to go all the way, they’ll be
charged with the whole truckload. Murder, Conspiracy, Conduct
Unbecoming, and even though he’s got me by the balls out here, Dan knows
that in a courtroom, he loses this case. Danny’s an awfully talented
lawyer, and he’s not about to send his clients go to jail for life when
he knows they could be home in six months.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: That’s the end of this negotiation. From this
moment, we’re on the record. I’ll see tomorrow morning at the
arraignment.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Here’s the story: The Goverment’s offering
Assault and Conduct Unbecoming. Two years. You’ll be home in six
months.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: “Wow, Kaffee, you’re the greatest lawyer in
the world. How can we ever thank you?” Fellas, you hear what I just
said, you’re going home in six months.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: I’m afraid we can’t do that, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Make a deal, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: We did nothing wrong, sir. We did our job.
If that has consequences, then I accept them. But’I won’t say I’m
guilty, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did you – Did she put you up to this?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: We have a code, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Well zippity-doo-dah. You and your code
plead not guilty and you’ll be in jail for the rest of your life. Do
what I’m telling you and you’ll be home in six months.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Do it, Harold. Six months. It’s nothing.
It’s a hockey season.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Permission to –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Speak!</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: What do we do then, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: After six months. We’d be dishonorably
discharged, right sir?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: What do we do then, sir? We joined the corps
’cause we wanted to live our lives by a certain code. And we found it in
the corps. And now you’re asking us to sign a piece of paper that says
we have no honor. You’re asking us to say we’re not marines. If a judge
and jury decide that what we did was wrong, I’ll accept whatever
punishment they give. But I believe I was riqht, sir. I believe I did my
job. And I won’t dishonor myself, my unit, or the Corps, so that I can
qo home in six months. Sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Commander, I want to talk to corporal Dawson
alone for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Let’s go in another room. Louden, everything’s
gonna be alright.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: We’re gonna go into a holding room.</p>
<p><strong>m.p.</strong>: Aye, aye, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You don’t like me that much, do you? Forget
it, don’t answer that, it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You know, Downey worships you. He’s gonna do
whatever you do. Are you really gonna let this happen to him because of
a code? Harold?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Do you think we were right?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: It doesn’t matter what I –</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Do you think we were right?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I think you’d lose.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: You’re such a coward, I can’t believe they
let you wear a uniform.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m not gonna feel responsible for this,
Harold. I did everything I could. You’re going to Levenworth for the
better part of your life, and you know what? I don’t give a shit.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What happened to saluting an officer when he
leaves the room?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Dawson’s gonna go to jail just to spite me.
Fine. If he wants to jump off a cliff, that’s his business. I’m not
gonna hold his hand on the way down. I want to get him a new lawyer. How
do I do it?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You just make a motion tomorrow morning at the
arraignment. The judge’ll ask you if you want to enter a plea. You tell
him you want new counsel assigned.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Then that’s that.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yeah. One thing, though. When you ask the judge
for new counsel, Danny, be sure and ask nicely.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I want you to let ’em be judged! I want you to
stand up and make an argument!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: An argument that didn’t work for Calley at My
Lai, an argument that didn’t work for the Nazis at Nuremberg.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: For Christ sake, Sam, do you really think
that’s the same as two teenage marines executing a routine order that
they never believed would result in harm? These guys aren’t the
Nazis.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Don’t look now, Danny, but you’re making an
argument.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yeah. Tomorrow morning I’ll get them a new
attorney.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why are you so afraid to be a lawyer? Were
daddy’s expectations really that high?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Please, spare me the psycho-babble father
bullshit. Dawson and Downey’ll have their day in court, but they’ll have
it with another lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Another lawyer won’t be good enough. They need
you. You know how to win. You know they have a case. And you know how to
win. You walk away from this now, and you have sealed their fate.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Their fate was sealed the moment Santiago
died.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Do you believe they have a defense?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You and Dawson both live in the same
dreamland. It doesn’t matter what I believe, it only matters what I can
prove. So please don’t tell me what I know and don’t know. I know the
law.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You know nothing about the law. You’re a used
car salesman, Daniel. You’re an ambulance chaser with a rank. You’re
nothing. Live with that.</p>
<p><strong>yuppie lawyer</strong>: …So I told duncan if we leverage the
acquisition of Biotech, the interrogatories would be there on demand.
All I have to do is not pick up the phone and it’ll run Flaherty ten
thousand a day in court costs.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: All rise.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: Docket number 411275. VR-5. United
States versus Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson and Private First Class
Loudon Downey. Defendants are charged with Conspiracy to Commit Murder,
Murder in the First Degree, and Conduct Unbecoming a United States
Marine.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Does defense wish to enter a plea?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yeah. They’re not guilty.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Enter a plea of not guilty for the
defendants. We’ll adjourn until ten- hundred, three weeks from today, at
which time this Court will reconvene as a General Court-Martial.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Why does a junior grade with six months
experience and a track record for plea bargaining get assigned a murder
case? Would it be so that it never sees the inside of a courtroom?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We’ll work out of my apartment. Every night,
seven o’clock. Jo, before you come over tonight, pick up a carton of
legal pads, a half-dozen boxes of red pens, a half-dozen boxes of black
pens. Sam get a couple of desk lamps. I need you to start on a
preliminary medical profile and Jo, we need all the fitness reports on
Dawson, Downey and Santiago. The only thing I have to eat is Yoo-Hoo and
SugarSnacks, so if you want anything else, bring it with you. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: So this is what a courtroom looks like.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Were you able to speak to your friend at
NIS?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She said if Markinson doesn’t want to be found,
we’re not gonna find him. She said I could be Markinson and you wouldn’t
know it.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Are you Markinson?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Well, I’m not Markinson, that’s two
down.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I was wondering, now that Joanne’s working on
this… I was wondering if you still need me.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: They were following an order, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: An illegal order.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You think Dawson and Downey know it was an
illegal order?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It doesn’t matter if they know, any decent
human being would’ve refused to –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: They’re not permitted to question
orders.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Then what’s the secret? What are the magic
words? I give orders every day, and nobody follows them.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We have softball games and marching bands.
They work at a place where you have to wear camouflage or you might get
shot.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I need you. You’re better at research than I
am and you know how to prepare a witness.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’ve got medical reports and Chinese food. I say
we eat first.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Did you get any dumplings?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: This is our defense. Intent: No one can
prove there was poison on the raq. Code Red: They’re common and accepted
in Guantanamo Bay. The Order: They had no choice but to follow it.
That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What about motive?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We’re a little weak on motive. They had
one.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Just because a person has a motive doesn’t mean
–</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Relax. We’ll deal with the fenceline
shooting when it comes up. For now we start here – I don’t know what
made Santiago die, I don’t want to know. I just want to be able to show
it could’ve been something other than poison. Jo, talk to doctors. Find
out everything there is to know about lactic acidosis. Let’s start
prepping for Stone.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: As long as we’re on the subject of the doctor
–</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Listen to me, three o’clock he doesn’t know what
killed Santiago, then he meets with Jessep, and at five o’clock he says
it was poison? The doctor’s covering up the truth.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Oh, that’s a relief. I was afraid I wouldn’t
be able to use the “Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire” defense. We can’t prove
coercion!! Alright, fitness reports and biographical information.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Cartons 3 and 4.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No Cliff-Notes on these things?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Captain Hill, this is Lt. Commander Galloway,
I’m an internal affairs officer with the JAG Corps in Washington, D.C.
I’m trying to track down a Captain Matthew Andrew Markinson, USMC…</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Doctor, other than the rope marks, was there
any other sign of external damage?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No scrapes?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No cuts?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He resigned his commission a week ago
Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Bruises? Broken bones?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: No, please don’t put me on hold –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Doctor, was there any sign of violence?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You mean other than the dead body?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Fuck!! I walk into that every goddam
time!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t ask the last question.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lt. Kendrick, the type of disciplinary
action, or “training’’ as you say –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Object.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Please the Court, I maintain that nothing
could be more relevant than what the defendants learned by the example
of, among others, the witness.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And what happened after Kendrick came into your
room?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: He ordered me and Corporal Dawson to give
Willy a Code Red.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: His answers still have to come faster, Jo. The
Iowa farmboy thing’ll play for a while, but in the end it looks like
he’s searching for the truth.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: He’s right, and from now on, “Willy” is
Private Santiago. You start calling him Willy and all of a sudden he’s a
person who’s got a mother who’s gonna miss him.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Poker faces. Don’t flinch in front of the
jury. Something doesn’t go our way, don’t hang your head, don’t shift in
your seat, don’t scribble furiously. Whatever happens, you have to look
like it’s exactly what you knew was gonna happen. When you pass me
documents –</p>
<p><strong>jo/sam</strong>: Do it swiftly, but don’t look
overanxious.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And don’t wear that perfume in Court, it
wrecks my concentration.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Really!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I was talking to Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Time to go home. Try to get some sleep
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’ll give you a ride.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You’re a good man, Charlie Brown.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: See you in court.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Danny –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I know what you’re gonna say. You don’t have
to. We’ve had our differences. I’ve said some things I didn’t mean,
you’ve said some things you didn’t means but you’re happy that I stuck
with the case. And if you’ve gained a certain respect for me over the
last three weeks that you didn’t have before, well, of course I’m happy
about that, but we don’t have to make a whole big deal out of it. You
like me. I won’t make you say it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I was just gonna tell you to wear matching socks
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Oh. Okay. Good tip.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: We’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Bet your ass.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We’re gonna get creamed.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Lieutenant Kaffee?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You’re gonna save our son, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ll do my best.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Danny, I want you to meet Ginny Miller, Louden’s
aunt.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You’re Aunt Ginny?</p>
<p><strong>ginny</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m sorry, I was expecting someone
older.</p>
<p><strong>ginny</strong>: So was I.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Last chance. I’ll flip you for it.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: All rise.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Too late.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: All those having business with
this general court-martial, stand forward and you shall be heard.
Captain Julius Alexander Randolph is presiding. God save the United
States of America.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: No objection, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No objection.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Is the Government prepared to make an
opening statement?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: The facts of the case are this: At midnight on
August 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their
platoon-mate, PFC William Santiago. They woke him up, tied his arms and
legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. A few minutes later, a
chemical reaction in Santiago’s body called lactic acidosis caused his
lungs to begin bleeding. He drowned in his own blood and was pronounced
dead at 32 minutes past midnight. These are the facts of the case. And
they are undisputed. That’s right. The story I just told you is the
exact same story you’re going to hear from Corporal Dawson, and it’s the
exact same story you’re going to hear from Private Downey. Furthermore,
the Government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag
with poison, and entered Santiago’s room with motive and intent to kill.
Now, Lt. Kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he’s gonna
try a little misdirection. He’s going to astonish you with stories of
rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like Code Red. He
might even cut into a few officers for you. He’ll have no evidence, mind
you, none. But it’s gonna be entertaining. When we get to the end, all
the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention
from the fact that Willy Santiago is dead, and Dawson and Downey killed
him. These are the facts of the case. And they are undisputed.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Lt. Kaffee?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: There was no poison on the rag and there was
no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because
it just ain’t true. When Dawson and Downey went into Santiago’s room
that night, it wasn’t because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn’t to kill
or harm, and it wasn’t because they were looking for kicks on a Friday
night. It’s because it was what they were ordered to do. Let me say that
again: It’s because it was what they were ordered to do. Now, out in the
real world, that means nothing. And here at the Washington Navy Yard, it
doesn’t mean a whole lot more. But if you’re a marine assigned to Rifle
Security Company Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and you’re given an
order, you follow it or you pack your bags. Make no mistake about it,
Harold Dawson and Louden Downey are sitting before you in judgement
today because they did their job.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Is the Government ready to call its first
witness?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Please the Court, the Government calls Mr. R.C
McGuire.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: How you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Mr. McGuire, would you state your full name
and occupation for the record, please?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent, Naval
Investigative Service.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Mr. McGuire, did your office receive a letter
from PFC William Santiago on 3 August of this year?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: We did.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What did the letter say?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: That a member of Private Santiago’s unit
had illegally fired his weapon over the fenceline.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Was that marine identified in the letter?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: No sir. I notified the barracks C.O.,
Colonel Jessep, that I would be coming down to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: And what did you find?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: For the shift reported, only one sentry
returned his weapon to the switch with a round of ammunition
missing.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: And who was that?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Corporal
Dawson about the fenceline shooting?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: Yes. He claims to have been engaged in some
manner by the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: But you don’t believe him.</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: It’s not my place –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Corporal Dawson’s been charged with a number
of crimes, why wasn’t he charged with firing at the enemy without
cause?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: There wasn’t enough evidence to support
such a charge.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Mr. McGuire, I don’t understand what you mean
when you say there wasn’t enough evidence to support such a charge. You
had Willy Santiago’s letter.</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: Santiago was the only witness, but I never
had a chance to interview him. So I don’t know what he saw.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: And now we won’t ever know, will we,
Mr. McGuire?</p>
<p><strong>mcguire</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: No more questions.</p>
<p><strong>hammaker</strong>: Corporal Carl Edward Hammaker, Marine
Barracks, Rifle Security Company Windward, Second Platoon Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Corporal, were you present at a meeting that
Lt. Kendrick held on the afternoon of August 6th with the members of
second platoon.</p>
<p><strong>hammaker</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Would you tell the Court the substance of that
meeting?</p>
<p><strong>hammaker</strong>: Lt. Kendrick told us that we had an
informer in our group. That Private Santiago had gone outside the chain
of command and reported to the NIS on a member of our platoon.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Did that make you mad? You can tell the truth,
corporal, it’s alright. Did it make you mad?</p>
<p><strong>hammaker</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: How mad?</p>
<p><strong>hammaker</strong>: Private Santiago betrayed a code that we
believe in very deeply, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Were the other members of the squad angry?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Object –</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Were Dawson and Downey?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Please the Court, is the judge advocate
honestly asking this witness to testify as to how the defendant felt on
August 6th?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Corporal, did Lt. Kendrick leave a standing
order at that meeting?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>hammaker</strong>: Well it was clear that he didn’t want us
to take matters into our own hands, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What was the order?</p>
<p><strong>hammaker</strong>: Sir, he said that Santiago wasn’t to be
touched.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Corporal Hammaker, were you in Dawson and
Downey’s barracks room ten minutes after this meeting?</p>
<p><strong>hammaker</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Thanks, I have no more questions.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: The Government calls Corporal Raymond Thomas
–</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Please the Court, I understand Lt. Ross is
planning on calling all the other members of Rifle Security Company
Windward to testify.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: In light of the defense that Lt. Kaffee is
planning to mount, the explicit instructions of the platoon leader seems
particularly relevant testimony.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The defense is willing to concede that all
23 witnesses will testify substantially as Corporal Hammaker did, if the
Government is willing to concede that none of them were in Dawson and
Downey’s room at 16:20 on August 6th.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: The Government’ll agree to the stipulation,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Then we’ll adjourn for the day. You can
call your next witness in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: …And he was pronounced dead at
zero-zero-thirty-seven.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Dr. Stone, what’s lactic acidosis?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: If the muscles and other cells of the body
burn sugar instead of oxygen, lactic acid is produced. That lactic acid
is what caused Santiago’s lungs to bleed.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: How long does it take for the muscles and
other cells to begin burning oxygen instead of sugar?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Twenty to thirty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: And what caused Santiago’s muscles and other
cells to start burning sugar?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: An ingested poison of some kind.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Your Honor, we object at this point. The
witness is speculating.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Commander Stone is an expert medical witness,
in this courtroom his opinion isn’t considered speculation.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Commander Stone is an internist, not a
criminologist, and the medical facts here are ultimately
inconclusive.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: A point which I’m confident you’ll
illustrate to the jury under cross- examination, so I’m sure you won’t
mind if his opinion is admitted now.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Not at all, sir. Objection withdrawn.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Doctor Stone, did Willy Santiago die of
poisoning?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Are you aware that the lab report and the
coroners report showed no traces of poison?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Then how do you justify –</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: There are literally dozens of toxins which
are virtually undetectable, both in the human body and on a fabric. The
nature of the acidosis is the compelling factor in this issue.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Commander, you testified that it takes
lactic acidosis 20 to 30 minutes before it becomes lethal.</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Let me ask you, is it possible for a person
to have an affliction, some sort of condition, which might, in the case
of this person, actually speed up the process of acidosis
dramatically?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Commander, is it possible?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What might some of those conditions be?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: If a person had a coronary disorder… or a
cerebral disorder, the process would be more rapid.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Commander, if I had a coronary condition,
and a perfectly clean rag was placed in my mouth, and the rag was
accidentally pushed too far down, is it possible that my cells would
continue burning sugar after the rag was taken out?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: It would have to be a very serious
condition.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Is it possible to have a serious coronary
condition, where the initial warning signals were so mild as to escape a
physician during a routine medical exam?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Possibly. There would still be symptoms
though.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What kind of symptoms?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: There are hundreds of symptoms of a –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Chest pains?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Shortness of breath?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Fatigue?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Doctor, is this your signature?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: This in an order for Private Santiago to be
put on restricted duty. Would you read your hand written remarks at the
bottom of the page, please, sir.</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: “Initial testing negative. Patient complains
of chest pains, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Restricted from
running distances over five miles for one week.”</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Commander, isn’t it possible that Santiago
had a serious coronary condition, and it was that condition, and not
some mysterious poison, that caused the accelerated chemical
reaction?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: No. I personally give the men a physical
examination every three months. And every three months Private Santiago
got a clean bill of health.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And that’s why it had to be, poison, right,
Commander? ’Cause Lord knows, if you put a man with a serious coronary
condition back on duty with a clean bill of health, and that man died
from a heart related incident, you’d have a lot to answer for, wouldn’t
you, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Object. Move to strike.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Sustained. Strike it.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No more questions, judge.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Dr. Stone, you’ve held a license to practice
medicine for 21 years, you are Board Certified in Internal Medicine, you
are the Chief of Internal Medicine at a hospital which serves over 8000
men. In your professional opinion, was Willy Santiago poisoned?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Your Honor, we re-new our objection to Commander
Stone’s testimony, and ask that it be stricken from the record. And we
further ask that the Court instruct the jury to lend no weight to this
witness’s testimony.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: The objection’s overruled, counsel.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Sir, the defense strenuously objects and
requests a meeting in chambers so that his honor might have an
opportunity to hear discussion before ruling on the objection.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: The objection of the defense has been
heard and overruled.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Exception.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Noted. The witness is an expert and the
court will hear his opinion.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Doctor, in your expert, professional opinion,
was Willy Santiago poisoned?</p>
<p><strong>stone</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Thank you, sir, I have no more questions.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Commander, you may step down.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Please the Court, while we reserve the right
to call rebuttal witnesses if the need arises, the Government rests.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: We’ll stand in recess until ten- hundred
hours this Monday, the l9th at which time the defense will call it’s
first witness.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: Ten hut.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I strenuously object? Is that how it works?
Objection. Overruled. No, no, no, no, I strenuously object. Oh, well if
you strenuously object, let me take a moment to reconsider.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I got it on the record.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You also got it in the jury’s head that we’re
afraid of the doctor. You object once so they can hear you say he’s not
a criminologist. You keep after it and it looks like this great cross we
did was just a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks. It’s the difference between
paper law and trial –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sam –</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Christ, you even had the Judge saying Stone was
an expert!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sam, she made a mistake. Let’s not relive
it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m gonna go call my wife. I’ll meet you
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why do you hate them so much?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They beat up on a weakling, and that’s all they
did. The rest is just smokefilled coffee-house crap. They tortured and
tormented a weaker kid. They didn’t like him. And they killed him. And
why? Because he couldn’t run very fast.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Alright. Everybody take the night off.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I apologize, I, –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: It’s alright. We’ve been working 20 hour
days for three and a half weeks straight. Take the night off. Go see
your wife, see your daughter. Jo, do whatever it is you do when you’re
not here. What day is tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We’ll start at ten.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Why do you like them so much?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: ’Cause they stand on a wall. And they say
“Nothing’s gonna hurt you tonight. Not on my watch.”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t worry about the doctor. This trial starts
Monday.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m sorry to bother you, I should’ve called
first.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No, I was just watching a baseball game.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I was wondering if – how you’d feel about my
taking you to dinner tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo, are you asking me out on a date?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: It sounded like you were asking me out on a
date.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ve been asked out on dates before, and
that’s what it sounded like.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Do you like seafood? I know a good seafood
place.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: My third case was a Drunk and Disorderly. The
trial lasted nine weeks. I rounded up 31 people who were in the bar that
night.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Nine weeks on a D and D? What was the
prosecutor offering?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: 15 days.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Well, you sure hustled the shit outta
him.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: After that, they moved me to internal
affairs.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Tough to blame them.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Where I’ve earned two distinguished service
medals and two letters of commendation.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Why are you always giving me your
resume?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Because I want you to think I’m good lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: No you don’t. I think you’re an exceptional
lawyer. I watch the jurors, they respond to you, they like you. I see
you convincing them. I think Dawson and Downey are gonna end up owing
their lives to you.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo… I think you have to prepare yourself for
the fact that we’re gonna lose. Ross’s opening speech, it was all true.
I mean, let’s pretend for a minute that it would actually matter to this
jury that the guys were given an order. We can’t prove it ever happened.
We’ll keep doing what we’re doing, and we’ll put on a show, but at the
end of the day, all we have is the testimony of two people accused of
murder.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: We’ll find Markinson.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo, we’re gonna lose. And we’re gonna lose
huge.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Corporal Jeffrey Owen Howard, Marine
Barracks Windward, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Corporal Howard, name some reasons why a
marine would get a code red?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Being late for platoon or company meetings,
keeping his barracks in disorder, falling back on a run…</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Have you ever received a code red?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yes sir. We were doing seven man assault
drills, and my weapon slipped. It’s just cause it was over a hundred
degrees and my palms were sweaty and I’d forgot to use the resin like we
were taught.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And what happened?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: That night the guys in my squad threw a
blanket over me and took turns punching me in the arm for five minutes.
Then they poured glue on my hands. And it worked, too, ’cause I ain’t
never dropped my weapon since.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Was Private Santiago ever late for platoon
meetings?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Was his barracks ever in disorder?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did he ever fall back on a run?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: All the time, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did he ever, prior to the night of August
6th, receive a code red?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Never?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You got a code red ’cause your palms were
sweaty. Why didn’t Santiago, this burden to his unit, ever get one?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Dawson wouldn’t allow it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Dawson wouldn’t allow it.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: The guys talked tough about Santiago, but
they wouldn’t go near him. They were too afraid of Dawson, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Object. The witness is characterizing.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever want to
give Santiago a code red?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Why didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: ’Cause Dawson’d kick my butt, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Good enough. Lt. Ross is gonna ask you some
questions now.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Corporal Howard, I hold here The Marine Guide
and General Information Handbook for New Recruits. Are you familiar with
this book?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Have you read it?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Good. Would you turn to the chapter that deals
with code reds, please.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Just flip to the page in that book that
discusses code reds.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Sir, you see, Code Red is a term we use –
it’s just used down at GITMO, sir. I don’t know if it actually –</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: We’re in luck, then. The Marine Corps Guide
for Sentry Duty, NAVY BASE Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. I assume we’ll find the
term code red and its definition in this book, am I correct?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: No? Corporal Howard, I’m a marine. Is their no
book, no manual or pamphlet, no set of orders or regulations that let me
know that, as a marine, one of my duties is to perform code reds?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: No sir. No books, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Corporal, would you turn to the page in this
book that says where the enlisted men’s mess hall is?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Lt. Kaffee, that’s not in the book, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I don’t understand, how did you know where
the enlisted men’s mess hall was if it’s not in this book?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I guess I just followed the crowd at chow
time, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No more questions.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Corporal Howard, you can step down.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Seven tonight, we’ll do a final Kendrick
review. I want to slam- dunk this guy.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Hey, Luther.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Admiral, how’s the big case goin’?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Nose to the grindstone.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: No flies on you.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: A rolling stone gathers no moss.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Yeah, well it ain’t over til the fat lady
sings.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Ain’t that the truth. Catch you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s Matthew Markinson.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jesus fucking Christ!!–</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: You left the door unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Scared the shit outta me.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Drive.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Are you aware you’re under subpoena?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Yes. I’m also aware that the lives of two
marines are in your hands. If there was something I could do about that,
I would, but since I can’t, all I can do is help you. Why don’t you
drive, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What do you know?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I know everything.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Was it a code red?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did Kendrick give the order?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did you witness it?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I didn’t need to –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did you witness it?!</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Then how do you know?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You know shit.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: He was never gonna be transferred off the
base.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Jessep was going to keep him on the base.
He said he wanted him trained.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We’ve got the transfer order. It’s got your
signature.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I know. I signed it the morning you
arrived in Cuba. Six days after Santiago died.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m gonna get you a deal. Some kind of
immunity with the prosecutor. In about four days, you’re gonna appear as
a witness for the defense, and you’re gonna tell the court exactly what
you told me. Right now I’m gonna check you into a motel, and we’re gonna
start from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I don’t want a deal. And I don’t want
immunity.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I want you to know, I’m proud neither of
what I’ve done nor what I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The Route 23 Best Western.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I want him guarded.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: That’s probably a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: This is Lt. Commander Joanne Galloway. My
clearance code is 411273.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Clearance code?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I don’t have a clearance code. Do you have a
–</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: It’s Jo Galloway. I need to secure a
witness.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: He also said that Jessep’s lying about the
transportation off the base. Jessep said six the next morning was the
first flight Santiago could’ve left on, Markinson says there was a plane
that left seven hours earlier.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: That was impressive. Did you hear what I
just said about the flight?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sam, when a plane takes off from a base,
there’s gotta be some kind of record kept, right?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We need the Tower Chief’s Log for</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Get it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: We’re gonna win.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo, don’t get crazy about this. We don’t
know who Markinson is. We don’t know what the log book’s gonna say. You
just concentrate on Downey. I’m gonna talk to Ross and tell him where we
are.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: “Kaffee’s got his case now, Kaffee’s got his
case now.”</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You are like seven of the strangest women I
have ever met.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: That was nice work today. The redirect on
Howard.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I have Markinson.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: A motel room in Arlington with 14 Federal
Marshals outside his door. Take a sip of your drink.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The transfer order that Parkinson signed is
phoney. And Jessep’s statement that the six a.m. flight was the first
available is a lie, we’re checking the tower chief’s log. But in the
meantime I’m gonna put the Apostle Jon Kendrick on the stand and see if
we can’t have a little fun.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I have an obligation to tell you that if you
accuse Kendrick or Jessep of any crime without proper evidence, you’ll
be subject to Court-Martial for professional misconduct. And that’s
something that’ll be stapled to every job application you ever fill out.
Markinson’s not gonna hold up, he’s a crazy man. I’m not saying this to
intimidate you. I’m being your lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Thanks, Jack. And I wanna tell you that I
think the whole fuckin’ bunch of you are certifiably insane. And this
code of honor of yours makes me wanna beat the shit outta something.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Don’t you dare lump me in with Jessep and
Markinson and Kendrick because we wear the same uniform. I’m your
friend, Danny, and I’m telling you, I don’t think your clients belong in
jail. But I don’t get to make that decision. I represent the Government
of the United States. Without passion or prejudice. And my client has a
case. I want you to acknowledge that the judge advocate has made you
aware of the possible consequences involved in accusing a marine officer
of a felony without proper evidence.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ve been so advised.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: You got bullied into that courtroom, Danny. By
everyone. By Dawson, by Galloway, shit, I practically dared you. Not for
a second have you believed you could win. You got bullied into that room
by the memory of a dead lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You’re a lousy softball player, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Your boys are going down. I can’t stop it
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Batter up, J.J.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lt. Kendrick, in your opinion, was Private
Santiago a good marine?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: I’d say he was about average.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lieutenant, you signed three fitness reports
on Santiago. On all three reports you indicated a rating of Below
Average.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Yes. Private Santiago was Below Average I
didn’t see the need in trampling on a man’s grave.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We appreciate that, but you’re under oath
now, and I think unpleasant as it may be, we’d all just as soon hear the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: I’m aware of my oath.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lieutenant, these are the last three fitness
reports you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson and PFC Downey. Downey
received three straight marks of Exceptional. Dawson received two marks
of Exceptional, but on this most recent report, dated June 9th of this
year, he received a rating of Below Average. It’s this last report that
I’d like to discuss for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lance Corporal Dawson’s ranking after
Infantry Training School was perfect. Records indicate that over half
that class has since been promoted to full corporal, while Dawson has
remained a lance corporal. Was Dawson’s promotion held up because of
this last fitness report.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: I’m sure it was.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Do you recall why Dawson was given such a
poor grade on this report?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: I’m sure I don’t. I have many men in my
charge, Lieutenant, I write many fitness reports.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Do you recall an incident involving a PFC
Curtis Barnes who’d been found stealing liquor from the Officer’s
Club?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did you report private Barnes to the proper
authorities?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: I have two books at my bedside,
Lieutenant, the Marine Code of Conduct and the King James Bible. The
only proper authorities I’m aware of are my Commanding Officer, Colonel
Nathan R. Jessep and the Lord our God.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lt. Kendrick, at your request, I can have
the record reflect your lack of acknowledgment of this court as a proper
authority.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Objection. Argumentative.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Sustained. Watch yourself, counselor.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did you report Private Barnes to your
superiors?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: I remember thinking very highly of Private
Barnes, and not wanting to see his record tarnished by a formal
charge.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You preferred it to be handled within the
unit.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: I most certainly did.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lieutenant, do you know what a Code Red
is?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Have you ever ordered a code red?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: No, I have not.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lieutenant, did you order Dawson and two
other men to make sure that Private Barnes receive no food or drink
except water for a period of seven days?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: That’s a distortion of the truth. Private
Barnes was placed on barracks restriction. He was given water and
vitamin supplements, and I assure you that at no time was his health in
danger.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m sure it was lovely for Private Barnes,
but you did order the barracks restriction, didn’t you? And you did
order the denial of food.</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Wouldn’t this form of discipline be
considered a code red?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: If I called the other 8000 men at Guantanamo
Bay to testify, would they consider it a Code Red?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Please the court, the witness can’t possibly
testify as to what 8000 other men would say. We object to this entire
line of questioning as argumentative and irrelevant badgering of the
witness.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: The Government’s objection is sustained,
Lt. Kaffee, and I would remind you that you’re now questioning marine
officer with an impeccable service record.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Thank you judge.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating of
Below Average on this last fitness report because you learned held been
sneaking food to Private Barnes? Not so fast. Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Corporal Dawson was found to be Below
Average because he committed a crime.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What crime did he commit? Lieutenant
Kendrick? Dawson brought a hungry guy some food. What crime did he
commit?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: He disobeyed an order.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And because he did, because he exercised his
own set of values, because he made a decision about the welfare of a
marine that was in conflict with an order of yours, he was punished, is
that right?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: Corporal Dawson disobeyed an order.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yeah, but it wasn’t a order, was it? After
all, it’s peacetime. He wasn’t being asked to secure a hill… or advance
on a beachhead. I mean, surely a marine of Dawson’s intelligence can be
trusted to determine on his own, which are the really important orders,
and which orders might, say, be morally questionable. Lt. Kendrick? Can
he? Can Corporal Dawson determine on his own which orders he’s gonna
follow?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: No, he can not.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: A lesson he learned after the Curtis Barnes
incident, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: I would think so.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You know so, don’t you, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Object!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Lieutenant Kendrick, one final question: if
you ordered Dawson to give Santiago a code red…</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: – please the court –</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: I told those men not to touch
Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: – is it reasonable to think that he would’ve
disobeyed you again?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Lieutenant, don’t answer that.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You don’t have to, I’m through.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order Corporal
Dawson and Private Downey to give Willy Santiaga code red?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Lt. Kendrick, did you –</p>
<p><strong>kendrick</strong>: No I did not.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What’s the word?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: This is the tower chief’s log for that night.
Jessep was telling the truth. The six a.m. flight was the first plane
out.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Let me see that.</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Workin’ late, lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: There was no flight out at eleven o’clock.
What the fuck are you trying to pull?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: The first flight stateside left
Guantanamo Bay at eleven and arrived at Andrews Airforce Base, Maryland,
at a few minutes past two.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Then why the hell isn’t it listed in the
Tower Chief’s log?!</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Why the hell did you think it would
be?!!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What are you telling me? He fixed the log
book?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Well, maybe he can make it so a plane didn’t
take off, but I can sure as hall prove that one landed. I’ll get the log
book from Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: He made an entire flight disappear?</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Nathan Jessep is about to be named
Director of Operations for the National Security Council. You don’t get
to that position without knowing how to side-step a few land mines. And
putting me on the stand isn’t gonna make him step on one.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You’re taking the stand. Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: There’s gotta be someone who can testify to
the flight. A ground crew member. Someone.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Do you have any idea how many planes take off
and land every day? A kid from the ground crew isn’t gonna remember a
flight that landed four weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Forget the flight. We’ll put Markinson on
the stand and we’ll deal with Jessep’s refusal to transfer Santiago and
he’ll testify to the forged transfer order. That’ll be enough. That and
Downey’s testimony really oughta be enough.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Private Downey, why did you go into Santiago’s
room on the night of the 6th?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: To give Private Santiago a Code Red,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And why did you give him a Code Red?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: I was ordered to give him a Code Red by the
Executive officer for Rifle Security Company Windward, Lieutenent
Jonathan James Kendrick.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You’re gonna do fine.</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: You think they’ll let us go back to our
platoon soon, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You remember the order of the questions?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And you’ll use small words?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He gets rattled when he doesn’t understand
something.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m just saying go slow.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m gonna go slow.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: And get him off as fast as you can.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Joanne!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: He’s gonna be fine.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: “Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago…”</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: I was William’s company commander. I knew
your son vaguely, which is to say I knew his name…</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: In a matter of time, the trial of the two
man charged with your son’s death will be concluded, and seven men and
two women whom you’ve never met will try to offer you an explanation as
to why William is dead. For my part, I’ve done as much as I can to bring
the truth to light.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: And the truth is this: your son is dead
for only one reason. I wasn’t strong enough to stop it.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: Always, Captain Matthew Andrew
Markinson.</p>
<p><strong>markinson</strong>: United states marine corps.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Private, I want you to tell us one last
time: Why did you go into Private Santiago’s room on the night of August
6th?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: A code red was ordered by my platoon
commander, Lt. Jonathan James Kendrick.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Thank you. Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Private, for the week of 2 August, the switch
log has you down at Post 39, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: I’m sure it is, sir, they keep that log
pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: How far is it from Post 39 to the Windward
barracks?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: It’s a ways, sir, it’s a hike.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: About how far by jeep?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: About ten, fifteen minutes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Have you ever had to walk it?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Yes sir. That day, sir. Friday. The Pick-up
Private – sir, that’s what we call the fella who drops us at our posts
and picks us up… also, ’cause he can get girls in New York City – the
Pick-up Private got a flat…</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: …Right at 39. He pulled up and blam! …A
blowout-with no spare. The two of us had to double-time it back to the
barracks.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: And if it’s ten or fifteen minutes by jeep,
I’m guessing it must be a good hour by foot, am I right?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Pick-up and me did it in 45 flat, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Not bad. Now you say your assault on Private
Santiago was the result of an order that Lt. Kendrick gave in your
barracks room at 16:20.</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: But you just said that you didn’t make it back
to Windward Barracks until 16:45.</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: If you didn’t make it back to your barracks
until 16:45, then how could you be in your room at 16:20?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: You see sir, there was a flat tire.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Private, did you ever actually hear Lt.
Kendrick order a Code Red?</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Please the court, I’d like to request a recess
in order to confer with my client.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Why did you go into Santiago’s room?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: The witness has rights.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: The witness has been read his rights,
commander.</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Hal?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: The question will be repeated.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Why did you go into Santiago’s room?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Your honor –</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Hal?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Did Corporal Dawson tell you to do it?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: He did, didn’t he? Dawson told you to give
Santiago a code red.</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Hal?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Don’t look at him.</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Hal?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Private. Answer the Lieutenant’s
question.</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Yes, Lieutenant. I was given an order by my
squad leader, Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson of the U.S. Marine Corps.
And I followed it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Where do you think he is?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: As far as Downey was concerned, it was an order
from Kendrick. It didn’t matter that he didn’t hear it first hand. He
doesn’t distinguish between the two.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Danny. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Sam and I were just talking about how all we
really have to do is call some witnesses who’ll talk about implied
orders… or maybe we put Downey back on the stand before we get to
Dawson.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Maybe if we work at it we can get Dawson
charged with the Kennedy assassination.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Are you drunk?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Pretty much. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’ll make a pot of coffee. We have a long
night’s work ahead.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: She’s gonna make coffee. That’s nice. He
wasn’t in his room. He wasn’t even there. That was an important piece of
information, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Danny, it was just a setback. I’m sorry. But
we’ll fix it and then move on to Markinson.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Markinson’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You really gotta hand it to those Federal
Marshals, boy. It’s not like he hanged himself by his shoelaces or
slashed his wrists with a concealed butter knife. This guy got, into
full dress uniform, stood in the middle of that room, drew a nickle
plated pistol from his holster, and fired a bullet into his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Anyway, since we seem to be out of
witnesses, I thought I’d drink a little.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I still think we can win.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Then maybe you should drink a little.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Look, we’ll go to Randolph in the morning and
make a motion for a continuance. 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Why would we want to do that?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: To subpoena Colonel Jessep.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Listen for a second –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Just hear me out –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No. I won’t listen to you and I won’t hear
you out. Your passion is comforting, Jo. It’s also useless. Private
Downey needed a trial lawyer today.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You chicken-shit. You’re gonna use what happened
today as an excuse to give up.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: It’s over!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer
order?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What are you –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: In Cuba. Why did you ask Jessep for the transfer
order?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What does it matter –</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I wanted the damn transfer order!</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Bullshit! You could’ve gotten it by picking up
the phone and calling any one of a dozen departments at the Pentagon.
You didn’t want the transfer order. You wanted to see Jessep’s reaction
when you asked for the transfer order. You had an instinct. And it was
confirmed by Markinson. Now damnit, let’s put Jessep on the stand and
end this thing!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What possible good could come from putting
Jessep on the stand?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He told Kendrick to order the Code Red.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: He did?! Why didn’t you say so!? That’s
qreat! And of course you have proof of that.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Ah, I keep forgetting: You were sick the day
they taught law at law school.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: You put him on the stand and you get it from
him!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes. No problem. We get it from him.
Colonel, isn’t it true that you ordered the Code Red on Santiago?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look, we’re all a little –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m sorry, your time’s run out. What do we
have for the losers, Judge? Well, for our defendants it’s a lifetime at
exotic Fort Levenworth. And for defense counsel Kaffee? That’s right –
it’s – a court – martial. Yes, Johnny, after falsely accusing a marine
officer of conspiracy, Lt. Kaffee will have a long and prosperous career
teaching typewriter maintenance at the Rocco Columbo School for Women.
Thank you for playing “Should We or Should-We-Not Follow the Advice of
the Galacticly Stupid”.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I’m sorry I lost you your set of steak
knives.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Stop cleaning up.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sam. Stop cleaning up.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Is your father proud of you?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Don’t do this to yourself.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ll bet he is. I’ll bet he bores the shit
outta the neighbors and the relatives. “Sam, made Law Review. He’s got a
big case he’s making – He’s arguing making an argument.” I think my
father would’ve enjoyed seeing me graduate from law school. I think he
would’ve liked that… an awful lot.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Did I ever tell you that I wrote a paper on
your father in college?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He was one of the best trial lawyers ever.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes he was.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And if I were Dawson and Downey and I had a
choice between you or your father to represent me in this case, I’d take
you any day of the week and twice on Sunday. You should have seen
yourself thunder away at Kendrick.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Would you put Jessep on the stand?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You think my father would’ve?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: With the evidence we’ve got? Not in a million
years. But here’s the thing – and there’s really no way of getting
around this – neither Lionel Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg are lead counsel
for the defense in the matter of U.S. versus Dawson and Downey. So
there’s only one question. What would you do?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Joanne.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jo, we look ridiculous. Stop the car.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Joanne.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I apologize. I was angry and… I’m sorry
about what I said.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m gonna put Jessep on the stand.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I say we hit him with the phoney transfer
order.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What’s the transfer order without a
witness?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We have a witness.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: A dead witness.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And in the hands of a lesser attorney,
that’d be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look at this. Last night he was swimming in his
Jack Daniels, now he can leap tall buildings in a single bound.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m getting my second wind. Siddown. Both of
you.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Good. Jessep told Kendrick to order a code
red. Kendrick did, and our clients followed the order. The cover-up
isn’t our case. To win, Jessep has to tell the jury that he ordered the
code red.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And you think you can got him to just say
it?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I think he wants to say it. I think he’s
pissed off that he’s gotta hide from us. I think he wants to say that he
made a command decision and that’s the end of it. He eats breakfast 80
yards away from 4000 Cubans who are trained to kill him, and no one’s
gonna tell him how to run his base. Least of all the pushy broad, the
smart Jew, and the Harvard clown. I need to shake him and put him on the
defensive.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: That’s it? That’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: That’s the plan.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re gonna trip Jessep and he’s gonna
confess.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m not gonna trip him. I’m gonna lead him
right where he’s dying to go.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: And how are you gonna do that?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I have no idea. I need my bat.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I need my bat. I think better with my bat.
Where’s my bat?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I put it in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You put it in the closet.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I was tripping over it.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Don’t ever put a bat in a closet.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He thinks better with his bat?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I can understand that. I used to have stuffed
panda named Mr. Boob. I could never do my home work without him.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Stay here, I’m going to the office for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Boy, he does think better with that bat.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Sam. I need you to do something.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve gotta go out to Andrews.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Is Sam here?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He’s on his way.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did he got the guys?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yes. Listen, can I talk to you for a second?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: How’re you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I think he’s gonna have his hands full
today.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Listen. Danny. When you’re out there. If it’s
not gonna happen he’s not gonna say it …don’t go for it.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: If you feel like… if you feel like… You could
get in trouble. I’m special counsel for internal affairs, and I’m
telling you, you could get in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Why Lt. Commander Galloway… are you
suggesting I back off a material witness?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: If you think you can’t get him. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Do you think I can get him?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I think it doesn’t matter what I think. I’m an
administrator. I can’t seem to defend people.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You’re my hero, Joanne. From the first day,
you were a lawyer. Live with that.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: All rise.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Call your witness.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Where’s Sam?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: He’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Lieutenant, call your witness.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessep.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Colonel, do you solemnly swear that the
testimony you will give in this General Court-Martial will be the truth,
the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you God?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Would you state your name, rank, and current
billet for the record please, air?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Colonel Nathan R. Jessep, Commanding
officer, Marine Ground Forces, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Thank you, sir, would you have a seat,
please.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Colonel, when you learned of Santiago’s
letter to the NIS, you had a meeting with your two senior officers, is
that right?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The Executive Officer, Lt. Jonathan
Kendrick, and the Company Commander, Captain Matthew Markinson.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And at present, Captain Markinson is dead,
is that right?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Objection. I’d like to know just what defense
counsel is implying?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m implying simply that, at present,
Captain Markinson is not alive.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Surely Colonel Jessep doesn’t need to appear
in this courtroom to confirm that information.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I just wasn’t sure if the witness was aware
that two days ago, Captain Markinson took his own life with a .45
caliber pistol.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: The witness is aware, the Court is aware,
and now the jury is aware. We thank you for bringing this to our
attention. Move on Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes sir. Colonel, at the time of this
meeting, you gave Lt. Kendrick an order, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I told Kendrick to tell his men that
Santiago wasn’t to be touched.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And did you give an order to Captain
Markinson as well?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I ordered Markinson to have Santiago
transferred off the base immediately.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I felt that his life might be in danger once
word of the letter got out.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Grave danger?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Is there another kind?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We have the transfer order that you and
Markinson co-signed, ordering that Santiago be lifted on a flight
leaving Guantanamo at six the next morning. Was that the first flight
off the bass?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: The six a.m. flight was the first flight off
the base.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Colonel, you flew up to Washington early
this morning, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I notice you’re wearing your Class A
appearance in dress uniform for court today.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: As are you, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did you wear that uniform on the plane?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Please the Court, is this dialogue relevant to
anything in particular?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The defense didn’t have an opportunity to
depose this witness, your honor. I’d ask the Court for a little
latitude.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: A very little latitude.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I wore fatigues on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And you brought your dress uniform with
you.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And a toothbrush? A shaving kit? Change of
underwear?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Your honor.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Is the Colonel’s underwear a matter of
national security?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Gentlemen. You better get somewhere fast
with this, Lieutenant.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes sir. Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I brought a change of clothes and some
personal items.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: After Dawson and Downey’s arrest on the
night of the sixth, Santiago’s barracks room was sealed off and its
contents inventoried. Pairs of camouflage pants, 6 camouflage shirts, 2
pairs of boots, 1 pair of brown shoes, 1 pair of tennis shoes, 8 khaki
tee-shirts, 2 belts, 1 sweater –</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Please the Court, is there a question anywhere
in our future?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Lt. Kaffee, I have to –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m wondering why Santiago wasn’t
packed.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ll tell you what, we’ll get back to that
one in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: This is a record of all telephone calls made
from your base in the past 24 hours. After being subpoenaed to
Washington, you made three calls.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ve highlighted those calls in yellow. Do
you recognize those numbers?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I called Colonel Fitzhuqhes in Quantico, Va.
I wanted to let him know I’d be in town. The second call was to set up a
meeting with Congressman Ramond of the House Armed Services Committee,
and the third call was to my sister Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Why did you make that call, sir?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I thought she might like to have dinner
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Judge –</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I’m gonna put a stop to this now.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Your honor, these are the telephone records
from GITMO for August 6th. And these are 14 letters that Santiago wrote
in nine months requesting, in fact begging, for a transfer. Upon hearing
the news that he was finally getting his transfer, Santiago was so
excited, that do you know how many people he called? Zero. Nobody. Not
one call to his parents saying he was coming home. Not one call to a
friend saying can you pick me up at the airport. He was asleep in his
bed at midnight, and according to you he was getting on a plane in six
hours, yet everything he owned was hanging neatly in his closet and
folded neatly in his footlocker. You were leaving for one day and you
packed a bag and made three phone calls. Santiago was leaving for the
rest of his life, and he hadn’t called a soul and he hadn’t packed a
thing. Can you explain that? The fact is there was no transfer order.
Santiago wasn’t going anywhere, isn’t that right, Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Object. Your Honor, it’s obvious that Lt.
Kaffee’s intention this morning is to smear a high ranking marine
officer in the desperate hope that the mere appearance of impropriety
will win him points with the jury. It’s my recommendation, sir, that Lt.
Kaffee receive an official reprimand from the bench, and that the
witness be excused with the Court’s deepest apologies.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Overruled.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Your honor –</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: The objection’s noted.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Is this funny, sir?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: No. It’s not. It’s tragic.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Do you have an answer?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Absolutely. My answer is I don’t have the
first damn clue. Maybe he was an early morning riser and he liked to
pack in the nq. And maybe he didn’t have any friends. I’m an educated
man, but I’m afraid I can’t speak intelligently about the travel habits
of William Santiago. What I do know is that he was set to leave the base
at 0600. Now are these really the questions I was called here to answer?
Phone calls and footlockers? Please tell me you’ve got something more,
Lieutenant. Please tell me there’s an ace up your sleeve. These two
marines are on trial for their lives. Please tell me their lawyer hasn’t
pinned their hopes to a phone bill. Do you have any other questions for
me, counselor?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Lt. Kaffee?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Lieutenant, do you have anything further
for this witness?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Thanks, Danny. I love Washington.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Excuse me, I didn’t dismiss you.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I beg your pardon.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m not through with my examination. Sit
down.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I’d appreciate it if he addressed me as
Colonel or Sir. I believe I’ve earned it.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Defense counsel will address the witness
as Colonel or Sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I don’t know what the hell kind of an outfit
you’re running here.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: And the witness will address this Court as
Judge or Your Honor. I’m quite certain I’ve earned it. Take your seat,
Colonel.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: What would you like to discuss now! My
favorite color?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Colonel, the six a.m. flight, was the first
one off the base?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: There wasn’t a flight that left seven hours
earlier and landed at Andrews Airforce Base at 2 a.m.?</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Lieutenant, I think we’ve covered this,
haven’t we?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Your Honor, these are the Tower Chief’s Logs
for both Guantanamo Bay and Andrews Airforce Base. The Guantanamo log
lists no flight that left at eleven p.m., and the Andrews log lists no
flight that landed at 2 a.m. I’d like to admit them as Defense Exhibits
“A” and “B”.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I don’t understand. You’re admitting
evidence of a flight that never existed?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We believe it did, sir. Defense’ll be
calling Airman Cecil O’Malley and Airman Anthony Perez. They were
working the ground crew at Andrews at two a.m. on the seventh.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Your Honor, these men weren’t on the list.
Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor, called specifically to refute testimony
offered under direct examination.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: I’ll allow the witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: This is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Colonel, a moment ago –</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Check the Tower Logs for christ’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: We’ll get to the airmen in just a minute,
sir. A moment ago said that you ordered Kendrick to order his men not to
touch Santiago.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And Kendrick was clear on what you
wanted?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Crystal.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Any chance Kendrick ignored the order?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Ignored the order?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Any chance he just forgot about it?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Any chance Kendrick left your office and
said, “The ’old man’s wrong”?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: When Kendrick spoke to the platoon and
ordered them not to touch Santiago, any chance they ignored him?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Have you ever spent time in an infantry
unit, son?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Ever served in a forward area?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Ever put your life in another man’s hands,
ask him to put his life in yours?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: We follow orders, son. We follow orders or
people die. It’s that simple. Are we clear?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Are we clear?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Crystal.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Colonel, I have just one more question
before I call Airman O’Malley and Airman Perez: If you gave an order
that Santiago wasn’t to be touched, and your orders are always followed,
then why would he be in danger, why would it be necessary to transfer
him off the base?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Private Santiago was a sub-standard marine.
He was being transferred off the base because –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: But that’s not what you said. You said he
was being transferred because he was in grave danger.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes. That’s correct, but –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You said, “He was in danger”. I said, “Grave
danger”. You said –</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Yes, I recall what –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I can have the Court Reporter read back your
–</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I know what I said. I don’t need it read
back to me like I’m a damn –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Then why the two orders? Colonel? Why did
you –</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Sometimes men take matters into their own
hands.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No sir. You made it clear just a moment ago
that your men never take matters into their own hands. Your men follow
orders or people die. So Santiago shouldn’t have been in any danger at
all, should he have, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You little bastard.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Your Honor, I have to ask for a recess to
–</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’d like an answer to the question,
Judge.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: The Court’ll wait for answer.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: If Kendrick told his men that Santiago
wasn’t to be touched, then why did he have to be transferred?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Kendrick ordered the code red, didn’t he?
Because that’s what you told Kendrick to do.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Object!</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Counsel.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And when it went bad, you cut these guys
loose.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Your Honor –</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: That’ll be all, counsel.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You had Markinson sign a phony transfer
order –</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Judge –</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You doctored the log books.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Damnit Kaffee!!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ll ask for the forth time. You ordered
–</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You want answers?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I think I’m entitled to them.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You want answers?!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I want the truth.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You can’t handle the truth!</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Son, we live in a world that has walls. And
those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. Who’s gonna do it? You?
You, Lt. Weinberg? I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly
fathom. You weep for Santiago and you curse the marines. You have that
luxury. You have the luxury of not knowing what I know: That Santiago’s
death, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while
grotesque and incomprehensible to you, saves lives. You don’t want the
truth. Because deep down, in places you don’t talk about at parties, you
want me on that wall. You need me there. We use words like honor, code,
loyalty… we use these words as the backbone to a life spent defending
something. You use ’em as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the
inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the
blanket of the very freedom I provide, then questions the manner in
which I provide it. I’d prefer you just said thank you and went on your
way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon and stand a post. Either
way, I don’t give a damn what you think you’re entitled to.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did you order the code red?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I did the job you sent me to do.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Did you order the code red?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You’re goddamn right I did.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Please the court, I suggest the jury be
dismissed so that we can move to an immediate Article 39a Session. The
witness has rights.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Lt. Ross?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: The Sergeant at Arms will take the jury to
an ante-room where you’ll wait until further instruction.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: Captain, what the hell’s going on? I did my
job. I’d do it again. Now I’m getting on a plane and going back to my
base.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: M.P.’s, guard the prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Guard the prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: What the hell –</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Colonel Jessep, you have the right to remain
silent. Any statement you do make can be used against you in a trial by
court-martial or other judicial or administrative proceeding. You have
the right…</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I’m being charged with a crime? I’m – that’s
what this is – Marine! Marine!! I’m being charged with a crime? I’m –
that’s what’s happening? This – I’m – this is funny, you know that, this
is –</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I’m gonna tear your eyes right outta your
head and piss in your dead skull. You fucked with the wrong marine.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Colonel Jessep, do you understand those rights
as I have just read then to you?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: I saved lives. That boy was – there was a
weak link. I saved lives, you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>jessep</strong>: You fuckin’ people. You have no idea how to
defend a nation. All you did was weaken a country today, Kaffee. That’s
all you did. You put people in danger. Sweet dreams, son.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Don’t call me son. I’m a lawyer, and an
officer of the United States Navy. And you’re under arrest you
sonofabitch.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: The witness is excused.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: Ten-hut.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: Have the jurors reached a verdict?</p>
<p><strong>jury foreman</strong>: We have, sir.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: On the charge of Murder, the Members find
the defendants Not Guilty.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: On the charge of Conspiracy to Commit
Murder, the Members find the defendants Not Guilty.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: On the charge of Conduct Unbecoming a
United States Marine, the members find the defendants Guilty as
Charged.</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: The defendants are hereby sentenced by
this court to time already served, and are ordered…</p>
<p><strong>randolph</strong>: …And are ordered to be dishonorably
discharged from the marine corps. This Court-Martial is adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: Ten hut.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Harold, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: I don’t understand. Colonel Jessep said he
ordered the Code Red.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: I know, but –</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: Colonel Jessep said he ordered the Code Red,
what did we do wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: It’s not as simple as –</p>
<p><strong>downey</strong>: What did we do wrong?</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: We did nothing wrong.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yes you did! A jury just said your conduct was
unbecoming a marine. What does that mean?!</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: You’re the lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You’re the marine.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: I never meant to hurt Willy.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: Kaffee, I’ve gotta take these guys
over to personnel for some paper work.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant at arms</strong>: Gentleman?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Harold!</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Sir!</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: You don’t need to wear a patch on your arm
to have honor.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: Ten-hut.</p>
<p><strong>dawson</strong>: There’s an officer on deck.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Airmen Cecil O’Malley and Anthony Perez? What
exactly were these guys gonna testify to?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Unless I’m mistaken they were gonna testify,
under oath, that they have absolutely no recollection of anything.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Strong witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: And very handsome, too, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: I’ll see you around the campus. I’ve gotta go
arrest Kendrick.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Tell him I say “Hi”.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Will do.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What do you say we take the rest of the day off.
Go out someplace. Sam? Champagne? Yoo-Hoo?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Thanks, I can’t. I’m gonna go home and talk to
my daughter. I think she’s gotta be bilingual by now.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: So what’s next for you?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Staff Sargeant Henry Williamson. He went to
the movies on company time. What about you?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Me? Oh… you know… the usual.</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: Just pretty much generally annoying
people?</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Yeah. So what do you say? How ’bout a
celebration?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: No. How ’bout a date. A real date. Dinner.
Attractive clothes. The works.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Sounds good. Who do you think I should call?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’ll pick you up at seven.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: What are you gonna do now?</p>
<p><strong>kaffee</strong>: I’m gonna get started on Henry Williamson.
Stand my post for a while.</p>
<p><strong>jo</strong>: Wear matching socks.</p>
