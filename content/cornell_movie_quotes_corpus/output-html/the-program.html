<h1 id="the-program">the-program</h1>
<p><strong>sportscaster’s voice</strong>: Allright, bowl bid ridin’ here
for E.S.U. Fourth down on the Georgia Tech 18. 4 ticks left. Kane sets
’em down.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Coach, this is the second year in a row
you’ve failed to go to a bowl game. Do you feel your program’s in
decline?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: No, we’re just a young team on the verge.
We’ll be back in a major bowl next year.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Good throw, Joe. It was there.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So was half their team. Shit, another Christmas
at home.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Next year, man. Next year we sell out. Next
year we dominate.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: You still need a deep threat or a
breakaway back to go with Joe Kane. What are you gonna do to address
this need?</p>
<p><strong>coach winters</strong>: Stop wastin’ my time talkin’ to you
guys for a start.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: I’m not gonna lead you into the fog here,
Sam…</p>
<p><strong>chancellor wilson</strong>: I’m concerned about our Program.
It’s always been a source of pride to our students and alumni, but two
straight so-so seasons are having a damaging effect on our fund-raising,
both public and private.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Then stop raising the entrance requirements
on me. We never could have gotten Alvin Mack in here under the new
guidelines.</p>
<p><strong>chancellor wilson</strong>: As Chancellor, my first
responsibility is to the academic interests of this University.</p>
<p><strong>wilson</strong>: At a time when we’re committed to a 400
million dollar building program, alumni donations are down 15% the last
two years. Because they’ve also voiced their displeasure to their
legislators, we can expect a corresponding drop in state funds.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: The Athletic Fund is suffering too. Season
tickets sales are off, merchandising’s slow…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You layin’ all this at my door? There’s
been a recession on.</p>
<p><strong>chancellor wilson</strong>: Yes, but the heaviest drop has
been from the big donors, the 100,000 dollar club. These people are
recession proof. They sit in my box every game, and they’re much more
generous when we’re ranked and going to bowl games. Two of them, as you
know, are on the Board of Regents, including the Chairman.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What are you trying to say to me, Grant?
After 12 years, my job’s in jeopardy?</p>
<p><strong>chancellor wilson</strong>: I’m not prepared to discuss your
job right now; I just want you to be aware of the situation. The alumni
and the legislature are unhappy and they vote with their checkbooks. I
don’t pretend to be an expert on football, Sam, and I’ll deny that this
conversation ever took place, but I do know we need to win next
year.</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary and
player profiles are in your briefcase. We got a 9:00am tomorrow in
Philly with this kid Darnell Jefferson.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Looks like I’ve lost weight.</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: This kid’s the gamebreaker we’ve been
lookin’ for.</p>
<p><strong>coach clayton</strong>: Had a 108 yard kickoff return against
Taft. Michigan’s been down to see him twice.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Darnell, you have the potential to start
for us as a freshman. That 108 yard kickoff return you made against
Taft? One of the greatest runs I’ve ever seen a high school player make.
Now, Michigan is set at tailback for two years. You won’t play till
you’re a junior. With Joe here gettin’ you the ball, runnin’ 28 Thunder
right, you’ll be All-American with us as a Sophomore.</p>
<p><strong>reverend wallace</strong>: Yes, but I’m really more concerned
with Darnell’s education. He came here late. He’s got some catching up
to do.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Believe me, education is the first priority
in our program. That’s why all the players are smarter than me. After
all, a football coach is smart enough to understand the game, but dumb
enough to think it’s important.</p>
<p><strong>alvin’s mother</strong>: It’s real pretty, Alvin.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: When I turn pro, I’ll get you the house to go
with it.</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: It’s real nice, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I knew you’de like it, Lou. Merry
Christmas. Put some fresh flowers on your Mom’s grave for me. I’ll be
home in a couple days.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Have another Vitamin I, Joey. Didn’t think
we’de see you here this Christmas, little brother.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You won’t next year.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s father</strong>: Yeh, well we won’t rent your place on
the couch.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: You’re from E.S.U?</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Yeh. I was just sittin’ here by the
fire doin’ my homework, and decided to give you a call. See how you’re
doin’.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Coach Winters has been telling me about you.
I’m looking forward to seeing you when you come to visit. I’ll be your
guide. You are coming to visit aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>p.a. announcer</strong>: Now for the starting line-up for the
E.S.U. Timber Wolves. At tailback, number 20, Darnell Jefferson!!</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Thanks for showin’ me around, Autumn. I
don’t meet too many females like you. You got a lotta class. Real
efficacious. Maybe I’ll check you out in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I hope so, Darnell.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Now you know where I’m going and what we’re
indubitably going to be.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, Darnell, Welcome to E.S.U.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Yeh, good to see you guys. What happened to
the band and the dancin’ honies?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Regular students don’t come back for two weeks
yet. Not that they woulda been here. Now that you’ve enrolled, you’re
just another wormshit freshman.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Here’s your room. If you need anything call the
hall manager.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: See ya later. Freshman Placement test tomorrow
at nine. McKinnley Hall.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Uh, oh, the Lead Dog is back. There goes my
cover of the media guide.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, Bobby, Lats, how ya doin? This is Darnell
Jefferson, freshman tailback.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: How ya’ doin’?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I was hopin’ you’de have rolled your bike or
somethin’. Nothin’ serious, just enough to keep you out for the
season.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No such luck, Backup Man. But I’ll try to
engineer a few blowouts. Get you get some mop-up time. Shit, Lats, you
look buffed, man. You put on some weight?</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: 35 lbs. Spent the summer in the gym. I’m
tired of watchin’ you guys play. I intend to start this year.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You get any bigger, you can play offense.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Yeh, but don’t I have to get dumber
too?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You still seein’ Louanne?</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Yeh. Now and then, when the tide rises. Don’t
want her to think this is some kind’ve exclusive deal.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Coach finds out you’re nailin’ his daughter,
you’ll be playin’ dorm ball.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: I’ll bail before that. Besides, this is what
he gets for not startin’ me.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Hey, man, you seen this?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: You must be some very bad-ass
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: What? You didn’t know?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I knew there was gonna be an article. I didn’t
know it was gonna be on the cover.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Shit, we do all the work. You get all the
pub. Too bad we’re not allowed to hit you in practice. Be fun to kick
the shit out of a Heisman Trophy Candidate.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I guess you’ll have to wait till we get to the
pros.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Beer boy, get me some.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Does it look like I’m serious?</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Listen to this. “E.S.U. has a solid
nucleus returning, but the Timberwolves, coming off two disappointing
seasons, will only go as far as the strong right arm of Heisman
Candidate Joe Kane will take them.” That right, Joe? You gonna lead us
to the promised land?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m gonna lead… but can you follow?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What are we doin’, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: There’s something I wanta try. Gotta wake up
our Mojo. Start settin’ the tone for the season.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: This is not a good time to be settin’ anything.
You’re in no shape…</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Joe, c’mon Joe, don’t be an asshole. Joe!
God-damnit, why’s he always doin’ shit like this? Coach’ll fuckin’ kill
me. Alvin, go get him, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Hell no, you go get his ass. Crazy
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Fuck this shit.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: C’mon, Joe, that’s enough. Let’s get the hell
outa here. What if somebody drifts or crosses the line to pass?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What’s the matter, Bud? Can’t you follow?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: God-damnit, god-damnit. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Startin’ to look like a loaf of Wonder bread
out there.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: They’re makin’ us look like pussies, ya know.
Standin’ here suckin’ our thumbs.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Yeh, and there’s nobody from the Defense
out there.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: What are you lookin’ at? You think you’re
bad?</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: Bobby, be careful, o.k? Please, be
careful.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: This guy do this kinda shit a lot? They
never mentioned this in recruiting.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I don’t know… I left a lot of ’em
blank.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Don’t worry, you’ll do all right. Lotta people
don’t finish.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What are you doin’ with the trophy?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Coach Winters asked me to bring it to the
meeting. I don’t know what for.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I’ll see ya at the meeting. Take this for
me, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Hey, Autumn, hold up! What’re you doing
here? I thought students didn’t come back for two weeks.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I came back early to see a friend.</p>
<p><strong>darnel</strong>: You’re looking fresh, Autumn. A package of
pulchritudiness. What about getting together later tonight? Maybe get a
pizza? They got pizza in this town don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I can’t tonight.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: How about tomorrow night?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I don’t think it’s a real good idea for us
to see each other, Darnell.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: What’s the matter? I’m not good enough for
you all of a sudden? Too young, is that it? I’m not, ya know. They held
me back a year.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: No, it’s not that… I’ve got a boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Did you have this boyfriend when you showed
me around?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Yeah, well, it didn’t seem to bother you
then. I’m willing to overlook it now.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I was mad at him.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I caught him with another girl. A white
girl.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: And you’re still with this nigger?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Look, I got to get going, Darnell. I’m
sorry. I didn’t mean to lead you on. I’m glad you came here.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Wait a minute. I can at least walk with
you, can’t I? Nothin’ wrong with that.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I’m in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I can keep up. I run the forty in
four-four.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, Autumn –</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Hi, Ray. This is…</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Darnell Jefferson. Tailback.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Ray Griffen. Starting tailback.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I know. That’s why they recruited me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The two guys they recruited before you are
handing out Gatorade now. Better start strengthening your wrist.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: We’ll see. Give my best to Miss Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What the hell is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Good to see you again, gentlemen.
Jefferson, either take off the earring or put on a dress.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I wanna talk a little about what we’re
trying to do here. There are many highly respected people who feel
football is about preparation for life.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: These people are full of shit. You see,
football is not like life. It’s better. More exciting, more intense,
more fun. In life, people are always wondering how they measure up;
whether they’re getting ahead or fallin’ behind. In football, you know.
Every week you get a chance to show what you’re made of, a chance to
demonstrate the physical and personal qualities that all those poor
bastards who can’t play this game are left to agonize about.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Last year we didn’t make enough of those
chances. Last year everyone felt we let the school down. Fuck the
school. We let ourselves down. We let down a great tradition, a 120-
year-old Line of Champions.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Any football program worth the name is a
special brotherhood, an elite corps of warriors, a select group of
knights. That first time our starting unit takes the field, the first
time we huddle up; that’s our inner circle, that’s our Round Table. If I
were an upperclassman, I’d be real nervous about my seat, cause we got
some very talented new-comers this year. Guys who want a place at the
Table. This is the trophy one of our freshman, Darnell Jefferson, won as
a Pennsylvania State High School First Team All-American. You know what
this says to me?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Not a god-damn thing.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Everybody here was a high school All-
American. Whatever any of you have done before is out the window. We’re
startin’ over. Ground zero. The Table is empty. Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>coach clayton</strong>: He’s too pumped up. Tryin’ to win the
damn Heisman on every throw. I’m not sure he’s ready for all this
hype.</p>
<p><strong>coach humes</strong>: Little late to be worryin’ about that.
If we don’t follow up the Sports Illustrated cover with something, it’ll
look like we didn’t believe in our own player.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Don’t worry, Joe’s a tough kid. He’ll be
allright.</p>
<p><strong>griffen</strong>: Hey, nice writhing, Jefferson. You got all
the moves.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Allright, move it up. Let’s go, 15 yards,
run the next play.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Cut the necktie tackle horseshit. You think
you’re in some kinda highlight reel? He left you huggin’ air. Target his
guts. Drive right through his abdomen. I wanta see snot bubbles in his
nose. I wanta see shit in his underwear.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You injured, Jefferson, or just hurt?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: If you’re hurt, you can still play. If
you’re injured you can’t. Are you hurt or are you injured?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I think I’m just hurt.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: O.k., then get up.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Nice run. Think what it coulda done for us
if we still had the ball. This is a football. I want you to carry it
with you wherever you go. Never let it out of your sight. Any of you see
him on campus, take a swipe at the ball. Try to knock it out of his
hands. Recover it. If anybody, but you, returns this ball to me, you’ll
wish you’de never been born.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: This isn’t gonna get it, goddamnit.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I see tackling, but I don’t see hitting. I
see effort, but I don’t see ferocity. What do you think, they’re gonna
motivate themselves? Football’s just a game to most of these kids. This
is our program, our livelihood. It’s our job to make them care as much
about it as we do. Make them hate me if you have to. It’ll bring them
together, give them a focus. So get off your butts and put the fear of
God in these guys.</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Shit, Lattimer’s an animal all of a sudden.
Benchin’ 450. He’s gotta be on somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>humes</strong>: What, steroids? Why do you always think my
guys are juicin’?</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: I don’t know… he’s on the punt team for
three years, then gains 35 pounds of rip in one summer and an attitude
to go with it.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: We’re not doctors, gentlemen. The NCAA has
testing programs for this. Let’s let them worry about it. Besides, it’s
not that hard to put on 35 pounds in a summer, if you really hit the
gym.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: What you got tonight?</p>
<p><strong>cafeteria worker</strong>: Choice of three entrees. Shrimp,
lasagna, T-bone steak.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Tough choice. I’ll take all three.</p>
<p><strong>cafeteria worker</strong>: What a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: When do they give ya the scores on that
Placement Test?</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Who cares? I flunked it three times,
before I got in.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Long as you’re in the program, they’ll get
you through. Maybe not with a degree, but they’ll keep you eligible.
Just don’t do nothin’ embarrassing they can’t cover you for.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Hell, they even give Alvin copies of his
tests in advance. He sells ’em for a hundred bucks a pop to people in
his class. ’Course he’s gotta have somebody read ’em to him.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Fuck you, doughboy. I can read. See that
shoe? That says Nike.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I still don’t wanna flunk that test. I
wanta get a degree.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: What do you think, nigger? You’re gonna be on
the Supreme Court? All you need to know is how to sign an N.F.L.
contract.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What’s the matter with you guys? You’re
supposed to be a team. Winning depends on thinking and acting and going
to war together. But you don’t even eat like a team. You eat like two
teams. A white one and a black one. What do I have to do? Make out a
seating chart? Now get up. Move around. Mix it up. Now!</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Hi there. Darnell Jefferson. I’m a young
black man.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hey, glad to meet ya. Joe Kane, Caucasian. So
what doya think a that new Garth Brooks album?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I love that motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: That’s more like it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How ya’ doin’?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Little late to be workin’ out, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Only time I could get in here when the
football team wasn’t usin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, if it wasn’t for the football team, might
not be a weight room to use. You tryin’ to firm up a little, or
what?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Don’t need to firm up. I’m strengthening my
knee. Had arthroscopic surgery.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Had my knee scoped once too. When you’re
finished here, maybe we could get a yogurt, compare scars.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Sorry, I don’t date football players.
They’re all full of themselves. I saw you on the cover of Sports
Illustrated, so you’re probably worse than most.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: That’s real open minded of you. So you won’t
consider doin’ anything with me?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well at least tell me what happened to your
knee. What’d you do? Fall outa your convertible?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You know, there’s maybe one thing I’d do
with you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Tennis. I’ll play tennis with you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Tennis. You mean now? It’s raining.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Thanks for the game, Heisman. You took it
really well.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What’s this Heisman crap?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I didn’t say anything about being a Heisman
candidate. I don’t go around strokin’ myself about it. So what’s this
shit you’re givin’ me?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I… I’m sorry… I just figured you were
probably kissin’ yourself in the mirror every morning.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You figured wrong.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: So what do you want, an apology? I just
gave you one.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I want a rematch.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: A rematch?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Some other sport. I took my beating. You owe me
one. Either that or we go out.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Real good date, Joe. Remind me to take her
out.</p>
<p><strong>advisor smith</strong>: Darnell, I’ve reviewed your placement
test and I’m afraid you failed to meet our entrance requirements in two
areas.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: What does that mean? I can’t play
football?</p>
<p><strong>advisor smith</strong>: No. It means you’re going to have to
take some remedial classes, what we call “zero level” courses.
Specifically Math 0 and English 0.</p>
<p><strong>advisor smith</strong>: You won’t get college credit for
them, but they will help you prepare to take the Placement Test again at
the end of the quarter. If you pass at that time you’ll be able to
officially enter the university and take college level courses. You’ll
still be able to take an American History survey course, but it won’t
count on your record until you pass the Placement Test. But first things
first. To start, I’m approving a tutor for you.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: A tutor? I don’t need no tutor.</p>
<p><strong>advisor smith</strong>: Any tutor. And yes you do.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I think both Joe and the university are best
served by a straightforward Heisman campaign. Nothing too gimmicky.</p>
<p><strong>braver</strong>: We’ve compiled a mailing list of around 1300
opinion makers; newspapers, football writers, and sports anchors. First
we send them a packet on Joe and his achievements. Bio, stats, plus
human interest stuff; commitment to academics, charity work, etc. Then
we update it each week with a postcard. Heisman voters hate opening
envelopes.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I haven’t really done any charity work…</p>
<p><strong>braver</strong>: You’re gonna start. We’ve got some things
lined up.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: Unfortunately, because we weren’t in the
top 20 last year, we only have one network T.V. game to give Joe
national exposure. Although it’s a good one; Michigan. But we’ll also be
taping all our other games and buying satellite time. That way we can
produce our own highlight package and interview pieces and send them out
to T.V. stations all over the country for their sportscasts.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Any questions, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Ah, no… I just… you really think I got a shot
to win this?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Hell, yes. Plus it’s a good thing for the
program. Publicizes the school, gives a boost to recruiting, and it’s a
great thing for you. Jumps up your draft position, the size of your
first contract, everything. It’s a hell of an opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>nichols</strong>: All you gotta do is back it up on the
field, and we have no doubts about that, cause we know “Kane is
Able.”</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Hello…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: This is Joe Kane. What did you decide?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: What? It’s 3:00 in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I wanta know what you decided.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I don’t know… I couldn’t think of any other
sports I could beat you at.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Then I’ll pick you up tonight at 6:00.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Hey, Autumn.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Hi, Darnell. What are you doin here?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: My advisor says I need a tutor. Ya know,
just to get me over a couple rough spots. I saw your name on this list.
I figured if you couldn’t keep my attention, nobody could.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I’m sorry, Darnell, but I’ve already been
assigned. You’re gonna have to find somebody else. I’m tutoring Scott
Sherman.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Not anymore. I asked Coach Winters to
switch us.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Coach Winters wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Yeh he would. I’m a bigger prospect than
Sherman. He’s a lineman on the scout team.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: C’mon Autumn, you could teach me some real
erudition.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Will you stop using those big words. It
sounds ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: What doya mean? I’m improvin’ myself. I
learn a new word out of the dictionary every day. Mendacious,
pejorative, antithetical, commensurate…</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: And you don’t ever use them right.
Pretending to be smart is not the same as being educated. Or erudite.
It’s just a con. And it makes you sound stupid, no matter how big a
prospect you are.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: O.K… even more reason for you to be my
tutor. You already taught me something.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: We goin’ on that?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeh. I thought we might take a ride.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I promised my dad I’d never get on one of
those.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What are you, one of these trust- fund
princesses? It’s fine for me to play a game I don’t know, but I ask you
to try somethin’ different and you hide behind your daddy.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: All right. But we go slow. No cowboy
stuff.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: This speed, o.k.?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Yeh, fine.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Slow down, damnit. Joe… Joe!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Joe, look out!!!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: How could you do that, you stupid punk? It
isn’t funny, god-dammit, you coulda killed us! You’re crazy, you know
that…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Take it easy. I’ve done that a hundred times.
No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Oh, yeh? Then why are you shaking?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t know… I guess cause I’ve never done it
with someone else on the bike.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You just wanted to scare me. Are you happy
now?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeh, pretty much. And the scream was even
better than I thought it’d be. Every dog within hearing distance wants
to mate with you now.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You come here a lot?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Now and then. Why?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: It’s not exactly a campus favorite. This is
almost like hidin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I like places where nobody knows me. This too
low-rent for you?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: No, my dad owned a place like this.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Your dad? You mean he owned a chain of
these?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Not everybody with a Southern accent has
their own plantation. My dad could never afford to send me here. I
learned to play tennis on public courts. Mighta been able to play pro
someday, if I hadn’t hurt my knee.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: So you’re just a scholarship jock like me.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Yeh. You disappointed?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, I’ve just never been out with a jock
before.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Is that what we’re doin’ here? Goin’
out?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t know. What doya think?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I think you’re crazy for jeopardizing your
scholarship and a pro future by jumping motorcycles off of highways.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Just tryin’ to keep my edge, Camille. The other
guys look to me cause they think I’ll do anything. I lose that, I’m just
another guy, and we all get our ass kicked.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I don’t know, Joe. You scare me.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: The keys.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I told you, as long as you’re in this
program, you don’t take unnecessary risks off the field. A man in
contention for the Heisman Trophy should be able to remember that.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: O.K., using the things we worked on
yesterday, I want you to write a two or three page essay on some aspect
of your life. Something other than football.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Your father, maybe. You could write about
your dad.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Don’t know that much about him. He was off
in Detroit workin’ in a car plant when I was born. Got laid off, tried
to rob a jewelry store to get us some money. He died in prison. Some
kinda heart problem.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: How about your mother?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: She was always workin’. Usually two jobs.
Comin’ home one night she stopped to get us some root beer. Got caught
in a gang crossfire. Shot three times… died on the way to the hospital.
You want me to write about that?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Good, ’cause none of it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Jesus Christ, Darnell what a terrible thing
to do to somebody. That’s not funny. That’s sick.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Had ya goin’, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: No you didn’t. You just… How could you make
up somethin’ like that?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Sounded more interesting than the truth. My
mom took a vacation to Chicago when I was 12. Never came back. Don’t
know who my dad was.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Who took care of you?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I started hangin’ with the J.B.M.,
gang-bangin’… Did some time in the Hall. Reverand Wallace saw me playin’
football on a juvenile probation team. Took me in, got me into high
school. Only reason they accepted me was ’cause I could play football.
Sorta like here. Football saved my life. I’d be nowhere without
football.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Well, then… maybe you could write about
football this once.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Yeh, o.k… thanks. I’ve seen a lotta shitty
things in my life, Autumn. That’s why I know when I see somethin’
good.</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: Let’s review the chapter I read you
yesterday. Which two city states fought in the Punic Wars?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: I dunno. Detroit and Buffalo.</p>
<p><strong>tutor</strong>: C’mon, Alvin. You’re gonna be tested on
this.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Okay, Alvin, this is Mississippi State’s
offensive set. 2nd and 2 on our 24. What defense are you in?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Eagle. Zipper. Hero. Unless the set back
shifts into the I.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Good. How about here? 3rd and 7.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Okie. Thunder. Lion.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What’s your assignment?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Kill the Quarterback. Hit the tight end so
hard his girlfriend dies. Kill everybody.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Sorry… I lost my football.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Yes!! Starting defense. Place at the
table. Whooo!! Yes!!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: N.C.A.A. is gonna test half the team before
the game Saturday. Make sure Lattimer knows about it.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: As the veteran players know, we have Pride
Night every year before our opening game. It’s a chance to get to know
each other better, share some thoughts, and bring us closer together as
a team. So to start off, I’d like each player to tell the others in his
group what he likes best about football and then what he’s most proud of
off the field. I’ve asked some of the seniors to lead it off.
Gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: I don’t know… It’s the battle. The goin’
to war with the other guys. Hangin’ together.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Bein’ different from everybody else.
Havin’ our own dorm, stayin’ in hotels the night before games. Settin’
ourselves apart.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Havin’ a chance to be somebody. To do
somethin’ that people look up to you for. Your strength and your
courage. Not everybody can play football. We’re the lucky ones.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: The thing I’m most proud of myself for?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Just that I’m here. That I’m not dead or in
jail.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The great thing about football is you can lose
yourself in it.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: There’s no time to think, to worry, to have
doubts. Everything else fades away. You just move and react.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: The best thing is when you dominate. That
feeling when you hit a guy real good, really stick him, and you hear
that little moan.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: You know it’s killin’ him, but you feel
great. It’s just him and you, and he’s the one that’s hurtin’.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Welcome everybody to the Wolf Den where the
E.S.U. Timberwolves, led by Heisman candidate Joe Kane, open their
season against the tough Mississippi State Bulldogs under head coach
Jackie Sherrill.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: All right, let’s get evil. 60 minutes, balls
out. Let’s open a can of kick- ass. Kill ’em all. Let the paramedics
sort ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Hey, 23, don’t think I don’t recognize you,
you little fuck.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Hey, pay attention when I’m talkin’ to you,
nigger. You’re the guy that shot my mother aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tailback</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: You were tryin’ to steal her fuckin’ car
weren’t you, cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>tailback</strong>: Shut up. I never heard of your mother.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: What’s Alvin saying to that guy?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Just gettin’ himself pumped up.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: He wasn’t pumped up already?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Thought I’d never find you didn’t ya? But I
got you now nigger, and I’m gonna kill you motherfucker. I’m gonna bust
your guts open and watch you die.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Atta baby, Alvin, heads up. Big pop, Steve,
way to stick ’em. O.K. Joe, let’s go up top. Take it to ’em right
away.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: O.K. let’s put the women and children to bed,
and go lookin’ for dinner. Don’t let em up. 51 Strike, Orange left. On
4.</p>
<p><strong>bud lite</strong>: Bali Hi, will call you, anytime, any day.
Here am I, your special island…</p>
<p><strong>black tackle</strong>: Shut up, snowflake. You think you’re
in the school play?</p>
<p><strong>bud lite</strong>: No, Bali Hi, the endzone is calling. And
the highway runs right over your ass.</p>
<p><strong>black tackle</strong>: Bullshit, you’re gonna be my bitch,
baby. You gonna be my punk bitch.</p>
<p><strong>bud lite</strong>: So long, farewell, auf Wiedersehen, good
night, I hate to go and leave this pretty sight.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Jefferson! In for Griffen.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: 2:05 left. Kane hands to Jefferson…</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: Excuse me, son, but we’re gonna need that
football for another couple minutes.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Guess we’ll be on the payroll for another
week.</p>
<p><strong>bud lite</strong>: Good game, man. Really enjoyed it.</p>
<p><strong>black tackle</strong>: Yeh, you’re a strong motherfucker.
Shitty singer though.</p>
<p><strong>alumnus</strong>: Good to see ya in there, Darnell. Way to
hold on to that pigskin.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Hey, some guy just gave me a 50 dollar
bill.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Don’t worry, you’ll get 5 or 6 hundred once
you’re startin’, depending on how you play.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: But we’re not supposed to get any are
we?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Hey, man, you can’t live on $500 a month
scholarship money. And the NC double assholes won’t let us have jobs, so
you take your money where you can get it. I’ll keep it for you, till you
see the light. Shit, they oughta be payin’ us anyway. Athletic
Department gets 3 million just for goin’ to a bowl game.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: This performance today – two touchdown
passes, another you ran in. Where do you think this puts you in the
Heisman race?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I really have no idea. That’s up to you
guys.</p>
<p><strong>berman</strong>: Now let’s turn to our Heisman watch. We
begin with Sports Illustrated cover boy Joe Kane of E.S.U. who led his
team to an impressive victory this afternoon. Well, if Joe continues to
raise Kane, he may well be Able to dust off a large space on his trophy
shelf. Although the real test will come in four weeks against Michigan
and their Heisman hopeful, Tim Waymen.</p>
<p><strong>berman</strong>: Michigan also won big today. Timothy, “He
Could Go All The Way Men”, will be looking to do so against the
Timberwolves. And of course the able Kane will be looking to also. I
can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>bud lite</strong>: I don’t know, I never seem to make out at
things like this.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: You don’t make out anywhere. Or did you
finally break the snatch barrier this summer?</p>
<p><strong>bud lite</strong>: Fuck you, Bobby. Excuse me, Louanne.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Forget it, nigger. No chance for you
there.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Griffin’s goin’ to medical school. She likes
that light-skinned respectable shit. You’re just her ghetto toy.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Can I have this one?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: What are you so worried about? You haven’t
lost your starting job yet.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Just one.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Take it easy, Darnell. This isn’t a good
time to push things. You’re putting me in an awkward position.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Yeh, well, I got a little encouragement
along the way.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: That kiss… it was just… a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Bullshit. You meant it. I wouldn’t be
standing here now, everybody thinkin’ I’m a stupid asshole, if I didn’t
know you meant it. I wanna see you, Autumn. Not in study hall. Not like
your student. Like somebody to be taken seriously.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I do take you seriously, Darnell, but I’m
still with Ray. I can’t just go paradin’ around town.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I don’t need to go paradin’. We’ll go
someplace different. Someplace nobody’ll see us.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: God, why am I even considering this?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: All caught up on your arithmetic?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Yeh, you only gained 37 yards on 12
carries.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Just what we need, a little team unity.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m gettin’ a little sick of this asshole,
Autumn. I don’t like you hangin’ out with him. It’s embarrassing.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I don’t hang out with him. I tutor him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Then have him get another tutor.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I can’t do that. I made a commitment to help
him pass his qualifying exam. I can’t bail out on him now.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What the hell difference does it makes? They’ll
grease him through no matter what he does. Nobody’s ever gonna see his
graduation. Don’t tell me you’re falling for this guy. He’s just another
gang-banger with speed.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I just said I wanted to help him. What are
you more afraid of, losing your girl or your position?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Maybe you oughta think about what you’re in
danger of losing.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Maybe I will.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: So where you wanna go?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Maybe she’s out with some guy.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Who? Camille? I don’t think she’s the type to
screw around on ya. Shoot ya, maybe…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: It wouldn’t be screwing around. It’s not like
we’re going together.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: You’re right, nobody would ever see us
here.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Yes, I figure the key is to go places only
white people go. Next time we’ll go bowling.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Plus I saw this in Rocky. I never believed
a guy who was supposed to be an athlete would skate that bad, but now I
know.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Thanks, that was fun, sort of.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: You were pretty good for the first
time.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Well, it’s not really my first time. My dad
took me skating once.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: He used to play ball for E.S.U., didn’t
he?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Yeah, how’d you know that?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I saw his picture on the Wall of Fame. You
got his eyes. Luckily, you didn’t get his thighs.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Make sure you mean it this time.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: What are you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Couldn’t sleep.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I was just sweatin’ out some of the beer.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I didn’t go home with her. I thought about it…
but I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You drink too much.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Why didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Why didn’t I what?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Go home with her?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t know… I guess I figured maybe there was
somethin’ goin’ on between you and me.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Then why’d you pick her up in the first
place?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I was drunk… I needed some company.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Company? Yeh, I can see you havin’ a real
far-ranging discussion with Sheri.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I mean, ya know, physical company… I was… I
just needed to pounce on somebody I guess.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Why can’t you pounce on me? Aren’t I good
enough to pounce on?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, you’re more conservative… classier…
you’re not that kinda girl…</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: How do you know? You’ve never slept with
me.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: What makes you think she’s such a great
ride? I’m prettier, my legs are longer… I’ve got better tits. Why would
you go to her, when you have me?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I didn’t know I had you.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Well you do.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You shoulda looked for me at the library,
or don’t you ever go there?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I go there. I got a 3.2 in Political Science. I
just don’t go there on Saturday nights.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I have a paper due Monday. What’de she do?
Sit on your lap or just give you the nail-me stare?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Shut up, Camille.</p>
<p><strong>t.a.</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: Bobby Collins.</p>
<p><strong>t.a.</strong>: Can I see your I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Coach, we, ah… got a problem with Bobby
Collins.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Yeh…</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: He talked… a friend… into taking a test for
him and got caught. They had a new T.A. in there…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What’s the penalty?</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Well, the rules say automatic expulsion for
both of them.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Fortunately, we’ve got friends on the Board
of Regents. I think we can beat this if we really go to bat for him. We
got Mack off when he turned in that other guys term paper. But what
kinda idiot would do something like that?</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Well, I guess Bobby figured he was gonna
flunk…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I don’t mean Bobby. I mean what kinda guy
would be dumb enough to take a test for him?</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Uh, well… it wasn’t a guy.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: A girl? Typical Collins. He must have
banged her until she couldn’t think straight. Who was it?</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: It was… Louanne.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Jesus, Louanne, how could you be so
stupid?</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: I… he was behind, he needed help. I’m
sorry. I just…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Sorry! You’re sorry! You’ve destroyed my
credibility at the University, my authority with the players… Christ, it
looks like I’m running a dirty program. And Collins of all people! What
the hell’s the matter with you, Louanne?</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: I don’t know… I thought he… loved me…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Loved you? He loves anything that winks
back, the little rat bastard. And what are you gonna do for school now?
I use my influence to get you back in, it’ll stink to high hell. The
press’ll crucify me.</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: I’ll get in someplace.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: God, Louanne, I told you to stay away from
my players. That was my cardinal rule, stay away from the damn
players…</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: They’ve always been good enough for you.
Good enough to devote your life to. Why aren’t they good enough for me?
Or are they too good?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You’re changing the subject, Louanne. We’re
talkin’ about you breakin’ the rules.</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: Didn’t you ever break the rules just a
little? Didn’t you tell me once that 90 per cent of the schools obey the
NCAA rules, and the other 10 per cent go to bowl games? Was that just a
joke?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: You seen this? You got a D on your math
test.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Yeh, I kinda figured that. I had some
trouble on this last part…</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: We went over that last week, Darnell. What
is this time we spend in here? Just a joke to you? I don’t even think
you’ve been listening to me.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: I’ve been listening to you, baby…</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Don’t call me baby. I thought you wanted to
learn. But if all you wanta do is fake your way through, then get
another tutor to waste time with.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: C’mon, Autumn, we just had a good time, and
now you’re gettin’ all nuts behind this. It’s just one test.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: So far, it’s the only test. I want you to
study this whole chapter. By yourself, without me here. When I come
back, we’ll discuss it. Be ready to do problems based on it.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Whatever you say, Teach. I don’t wish to be
cast in a pejorative light, so I’m dedicating myself to achieving on a
level more commensurate with my abilities.</p>
<p><strong>bud lite</strong>: Coach’d probably shoot ya lower.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You all played a fine game on Saturday.
Take the day off.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: C’mon in, Collins.</p>
<p><strong>bobby</strong>: Listen, Coach, I just want you to know I’m
really sorry about this whole thing with Louanne. I was real glad to
hear she’s gonna be goin’ to junior college here…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I could easily take your case to the Board
of Regents. You’ve had no prior infractions and I could argue that you
were under abnormal pressure. But I won’t. You embarrassed me, you
embarrassed my family, you embarrassed the program. As of now, you are
no longer a member of this university or it’s football team. Clean out
your locker.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: We ready, Jerry? O.K., let’s mark it.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Joe, this game is being billed as a potential
“Heisman Shootout”. Did you feel any added pressure this week…</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: …knowing that you’re going head to head with
Heisman rival, Tim Waymen?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, ya know, you try to block it out, but
it’s basically impossible… Everybody seems to be talkin’ about it, all
the newspapers, the interviews…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The hype on T.V., tryin’ to get somethin’
goin…</p>
<p><strong>braver</strong>: Hold it! Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: What?! What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>braver</strong>: What you’re saying is true, of course, but I
don’t think it’s the message you want to send.</p>
<p><strong>braver</strong>: It makes you seem a little nervous. Like the
pressure might be getting to you.</p>
<p><strong>braver</strong>: This game is nationally televised, so most
Heisman voters will be watching. I think a more casual approach is
better. Modest, controlled, casual.</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: We all set now? Let’s mark it. Joe, this game
is being billed as a potential “Heisman Shootout.”</p>
<p><strong>swann</strong>: Did you feel any added pressure this week,
knowing that you’re going head to head with Heisman rival, Tim
Waymen?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, I don’t really think too much about that
kinda thing.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Your parents comin’ to the game
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: My mom’s dead. My dad has never seen me
play.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Guess he’s not that interested in football.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: But you’re one of the best players in the
country.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: He’s just not into it, o.k.?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: O.k. What’s goin’ on, Joe? You ask me out
here, like you wanta talk about somethin’, then you don’t say anything.
You worried about tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No… I’m worried about the days after that. I
just. I don’t know… I feel like tomorrow’s gonna be my last game. I want
to stay up, make the time go slow.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Why would it be your last game? You afraid
of getting hurt?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, that’d be a relief. Then, at least, I
wouldn’t be a failure.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Joe, why are you thinking like this? Why
would you be a failure? You’re having a great year, you’re a Heisman
Trophy candidate, you got millions of dollars waiting for you in the
pros.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How do you know what’s waiting for me? You
don’t know me at all.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I don’t know you? How can you say that?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Because you wouldn’t be here now if you did.
You only know the guy that’s supposed to make millions in the pros.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Is that what you think? That I’m with you
for the money?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Why else?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Fuck you, Joe. I don’t give a shit about
your money. I don’t even give a shit about football. And you know what?
Maybe you’re right, maybe I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Joe! Joe! My god, Joe, what are you doing?
No! No!</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: God Joe, oh god, are you allright?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeh, just got some dirt in my teeth. Guess
you’ve really seen the dark side now, huh? You should’ve gotten out
while you had the chance. Before it all goes to hell.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I don’t wanta get out, damnit. What’s wrong
Joe? Why would it all go to hell?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m a Kane, Camille. That’s all it takes. We’re
cut out to be drunks and fuck-ups. We never live up to expectations.
It’s in our blood. My dad, brothers, uncles – we all drink and sooner or
later we all fuck up. My dad went the longest. Waited till he was
playin’ triple A ball, before he hit the wall. Sometimes I feel like I’m
just waiting for my turn. The better I do, the closer it gets.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You’re not like them, you can beat all
that. You can stop drinking, you can break the chain.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: If I gave up that, I wouldn’t be much of a
football player. And if I wasn’t a football player, what would I be?</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You’de still be Joe. And I’d still love
you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Just don’t say I never warned you.</p>
<p><strong>zabriskie</strong>: 4:29 to go and it’s been a great one. Two
undefeated teams goin’ after each other. Michigan up by four, 24- 20,
but the lead has changed hands three times, and you get the feeling that
whoever has the ball last is gonna win it.</p>
<p><strong>schembeckler</strong>: Well, it was billed as a Heisman
shootout, and it’s been all of that. Both Waymen and Kane moving their
teams up and down the field, having big days.</p>
<p><strong>zabriskie</strong>: Kane back to pass, can’t find anybody,
gonna run it himself, ten, five, hit at the goal-line… Touchdown
E.S.U.!! Great run by Kane!</p>
<p><strong>schembeckler</strong>: He’s still down. Looks like he’s
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: How many fingers am I holding up?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Hey, powderpuff. You’re the white boy that
ratted my brother out. Sent him to jail, cocksucker. Ran off with the
fuckin’ money. Left the blood to do the time, huh?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Yeh, you’re the little bastard. Account of
you, my bros’ datin’ his cell mate. You hear me, powderpuff? Gonna make
you pay. You gonna be my cellmate now. You gonna have 250 lbs. of
pissed-off nigger up your ass.</p>
<p><strong>zabriskie</strong>: E.S.U. in an eight-man line looking for
the run on third and short.</p>
<p><strong>zabriskie</strong>: Waymen fakes to Simms, Mack on the blitz,
Waymen is goin for it all! Hit as he throws.</p>
<p><strong>zabriskie</strong>: Hunt has got a step. He’s got it!
Touchdown!</p>
<p><strong>schembeckler</strong>: Great clutch throw under pressure.
Can’t do it much better than that.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You’re vision’s back to normal.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You think you can go?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeh, I’m fine. Just a little headache. O.K.
Offense, let’s get it back.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Damn tough to scare that little white boy.
Either his momma dropped him on his head, or the motherfucker is
deaf.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Jefferson, in for Griffen.</p>
<p><strong>zabriskie</strong>: Ball on the Michigan 47, 1:02 to go, Kane
brings ’em to the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p><strong>zabriskie</strong>: Great run by Jefferson, the highly-
touted Freshman, the longest of the day for the Wolves. And this one is
turning out to be everything we thought it would be.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: O.K., time to put the women and children to
bed, and go looking for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: 82 Strike, Eagle, Crown, on 2.</p>
<p><strong>zabriskie</strong>: Kane looking for Jefferson. It’s…
Intercepted! Intercepted by Freeman! And that should do it.</p>
<p><strong>zabriskie</strong>: Well, it was everything we expected it to
be. Fine performances on both sides of the field.</p>
<p><strong>zabriskie</strong>: The edge in the much ballyhooed battle of
the quarterbacks would probably have to go to Michigan’s Tim Waymen who
threw for 2 touchdowns, and ran for another. Joe Kane accounted for
three E.S.U. touchdowns, but had that crucial interception in the waning
moments. And that proved to be the difference.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Hey, Autumn.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Hi, Darnell.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Is this your dad?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: How do you do, Mr. Haley. I’m Darnell
Jefferson.</p>
<p><strong>mr. haley</strong>: Jefferson? Nice run you made on that
screen pass. Another block and you might have scored.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Thank you. We’ll get ’em next year.</p>
<p><strong>mr. haley</strong>: How do you and Autumn know each other?
You a friend of Ray’s?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Ah, I tutor him…</p>
<p><strong>mr. haley</strong>: Oh really? In what?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Math and English.</p>
<p><strong>mr. haley</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. haley</strong>: Well, stay on top of that, Darnell. I’d
have been in real trouble if I hadn’t gotten my degree. I played ball
once. Hurt my knee.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Yeh, I know…</p>
<p><strong>mr. haley</strong>: I used to put a copy of my report card
inside the webbing of my helmet to remind me that college was more
important than football.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Good idea. Well, I gotta get goin’. Nice to
meet you Mr. Haley.</p>
<p><strong>mr. haley</strong>: Nice to meet you, Darnell.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: See you around, Autumn.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, Mr. Haley. Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. haley</strong>: Hey, Ray. You still havin’ dinner with us
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>bud lite</strong>: Anybody seen Joe?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Not yet. Probably out with Camille. Haven’t
seen Darnell either.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: I think we better get back downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: No, Leslie, we’re just getting to know
each other.</p>
<p><strong>leslie</strong>: No, I think…</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: C’mon Leslie, you didn’t come up here to
stop now.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: What were you doin’? Leadin’ me on?</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Get outa here!</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: This is it, man. No more ’roids. This shit has
gotta stop.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Hello, yeh… What?!</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: It looks like this will blow over. The
girl’s father is a big booster, contributed a lotta money. So he said
they won’t go to the press.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: He said that? The father?</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Yeh, he’s not exactly happy about all this,
but he doesn’t wanta hurt the program.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: We’re still gonna have to suspend
Lattimer.</p>
<p><strong>humes</strong>: What for? There aren’t any charges. Nobody
outside the program knows about this.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: He’s outa control, Lyle. We can’t ignore
this anymore. I don’t know what pisses me off more – that he’s juicin’
or that he’s doin’ such a shitty job of hidin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>humes</strong>: He’s never tested positive. If we suspend him
without proof, he could sue us for jeopardizing his draft status, his
pro career.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Yeh, but we can’t sit and wait till he
kills somebody. I hate to lose him as much as you do, but we gotta clean
him up before he does somethin’ that lands the whole program on
probation. Plus, we have to take some action or the girl’s dad is gonna
start havin’ second thoughts. I don’t care how many checks he’s
written.</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: So what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Bring him down here.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Three games? Why so many?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You oughta be grateful I didn’t suspend you
for the whole year.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: What are you gonna give as the reason?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: We’ll say you’ve got a hamstring pull.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Thank you, Coach.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Don’t thank me. During those three weeks,
you better kick the roids, cause when you come back I’m gonna personally
test you before every game. No N.C.A.A. shit either. I’m gonna watch the
piss go into the bottle. You got that?</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Start practicing your limp.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Coupla real college heroes, huh? Tearin’ up the
town.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: First time I ever lost a girl and a game on
the same day. Guess I never really had the girl.</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: You know that guy?</p>
<p><strong>debbi</strong>: Not really…</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: Then why you smilin’ at him?</p>
<p><strong>debbi</strong>: I don’t know… he looks like that E.S.U.
quarterback guy. Joe, what’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: So what? So you go and smile at him?</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: You been lookin’ at my girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t know. Which one is she?</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: Wise guy, huh? Mr. bigtime quarterback.
The one who choked his ass off today. You got nothin’ better to do then
look at my girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: Hey, Heisman, I’m talkin’ to you. You too
good to talk to me?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m not even interested in talkin’ to you.</p>
<p><strong>boyfriend</strong>: You think you’re a bad ass? You think my
girl’s hot for you? Take your pads off, you’re just another pussy.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: C’mon we gotta get outa here.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What is it now?… Oh Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The guy went for me first. What was I supposed
to do?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Doesn’t make any difference. It made the
papers, all the wire services. The guy had to go to the hospital. Worst
of all they got you on drunk driving. You had a blood alcohol level .50
above the legal limit. We can’t smooth that over, Joe. It’d look like we
were sprayin’ Pledge on bird shit. We had to agree to send you to
Rehab.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Rehab? I’ll be a god-damn joke. You can’t do
this to me.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: It was the only way we could get them to
drop the assault and D.W.I. You go to trial on those, we lose you for a
year, and risk NCAA investigation. C’mon, lotsa athletes have been
through Rehab.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Not in the middle of the season. Not in the
middle of a Heisman campaign.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You’ll only miss four games. You’ll be back
in time for the last one, Georgia Tech, and a Bowl if we get there.
Plus, you’ve still got your senior year.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeh, but what will I come back as? What kinda
player?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Don’t worry, you’ll still be the Man.
You’ll still be the leader of this team.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m sorry, Coach.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: These things happen.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Fuckin’ kids.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Darnell, wait. C’mon Darnell, I wanta talk
to you.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Where you been, I been callin’ you?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Been busy.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Darnell, I’m sorry about Saturday. It was an
awkward situation.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: It wasn’t awkward. It was educational. I
realized how you see me. I’m good enough to tutor, to go places with,
but not to tell your father about.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: That’s not it. It’s just that my father
expects me to be with somebody like Ray. He wouldn’t understand us.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I don’t know… he likes Ray cause…</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: He’s a good student, he acts right… he
doesn’t need football. He’s class and I’m not, right?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: You don’t have to, Autumn. I’m everything
your dad used to be and don’t want you fallin’ back into.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Darnell…</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: You were right before, Autumn. I should
have another tutor. Thanks for everything you did for me.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Four fuckin’ weeks?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Shit, the defense is gonna have to pitch
shutouts now… and you’re gone for 3. What the hell did you take that
shit for?</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Nobody seemed to mind when I was knockin’
people’s dicks in the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: I bust chops too. I don’t have to get all
fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Not everybody has the ability you do,
Alvin. You do what you have to do to play.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Well, you’re not playin’ much now are you?
Shit, whole fuckin’ season down the drain.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: I been talkin’ to Chancellor Wilson…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What’s he wanta do now, cut practice down
to once a week?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: No, he’s happy with the way the season’s
gone so far. The Alumni have pretty much stayed off his back, but with
Joe out now, it could all be up for grabs again.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: He thinks he’s gonna have trouble marchin’
the ball down the old fund- raisin’ board, huh?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: The facts are, all we have left are freshman
quarterbacks, and nothin’ I saw at practice today, convinced me that any
of them are ready to step in.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What are you sayin?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: We gotta get Bobby Collins back.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Wilson say that?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: He didn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Forget it, Galen, Collins is no All- Star
either.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yeh, but he’s good enough to get us a split
of the next four games.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Look, just because you’re Wilson’s boy all
of a sudden, doesn’t mean I’m gonna let him make me look like a fuckin’
whore.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Don’t give me that high and mighty shit.
There’s a lotta people on the bubble here. Four straight loses and we’re
out of bowl contention. How’s that gonna make you look? If you’re too
stupid to consider your own situation, then maybe you oughta think about
your assistant coaches. They’ve got families to feed too.</p>
<p><strong>fowler</strong>: Therefore, I respectfully submit that Bobby
Collins should not be given special treatment just because he’s a
football player. Would a regular student get a reinstatement hearing if
they’de been caught cheating? Nobody’s talking about letting the girl
who took the test back in.</p>
<p><strong>learnihan</strong>: I think it’s also instructive to look at
some of the courses this young man has taken. Beginning Golf, Voice and
Speech Improvement…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: I’d like to point out that Mr. Collins was
still on schedule to get his degree.</p>
<p><strong>learnihan</strong>: In what, Swimming Pool Management?</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Would you like to respond, Coach
Winters?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I don’t know much about all this other
stuff, but I do know the punishment should fit the crime. Cheating’s
bad, but I don’t think it deserves a life sentence. Here’s one of those
athletes who takes college level courses, who wants to graduate. I think
Bobby Collins made a big mistake, but he’s already been suspended for
several weeks. He’s served his time. I think he deserves a second
chance.</p>
<p><strong>learnihan</strong>: Like Alvin Mack? We gave him a second
chance and since he’s had 5 incompletes, 4 withdrawals and still reads
at a fourth grade level. You’re using his body to make money for the
Athletic Department – you, yourself, are making three times what the
Chancellor is – but obviously no one is making an effort to see that
this kid gets an education.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: He’s helpin’ to pay for your physics lab
too. If you’re willin’ to go without a new office, maybe I could hold
him out a few games. Save his body.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Gentlemen…</p>
<p><strong>shane</strong>: Alvin was way behind in school when he got
here. You can’t make up for, in four years, what it took 18 to
create.</p>
<p><strong>learnihan</strong>: Then he should never have been admitted
in the first place. It’s not fair to other students who worked hard to
get here.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Is it fair to exclude kids who come from
inferior schools? You hold everybody to the same standards, you’re
discriminating against the poor kids.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Most of my players are farm boys,
inner-city kids. Football is their deliverance.</p>
<p><strong>learnihan</strong>: Deliverance from what? A valid
education?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You throw Bobby Collins and Alvin out, you
take away their futures. In Alvin’s case you probably cost him a couple
million dollars in the pros.</p>
<p><strong>learnihan</strong>: But this is not a football vocational
school. It’s an Institute of Higher Learning.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Yeh, but when was the last time 80,000
people showed up to watch a kid do a chemistry experiment?</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Gentlemen, please, let’s get back to the
business at hand, Bobby Collins. As you know, I played football here.
And I remember how hard it was to practice and then study when you’re
dead tired. So I have some sympathy for this young man. But I never
cheated, so the real question is his character. Since you know him
better than anyone else in this room; and having talked to him and
observed him over the last several weeks, do you feel he’s learned his
lesson? In other words, can you vouch for his character?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Yes, sir, I can.</p>
<p><strong>learnihan</strong>: Another case like this, I’ll take it all
the way up to the Governor.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Don’t mess with me, Learnihan. I’ll have
you teachin’ Study Hall.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Hello, my name is Camille Schaeffer. I’d
like to speak to Joe Kane.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You’ve got a phone call. A Camille
Schaeffer.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: She says she’s your girlfriend</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I don’t want to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I’m sorry, he doesn’t wish to speak to you
right now.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Hey, Louanne, how ya’ doin?</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: Fine, Bud, ya know. Goin to J.C., hopin’ to
get back in here next year. Just came by to give Bobby some laundry I
did for him.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: You two seein’ each other again?</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: Yeh, he was even talking about us gettin’ a
place off campus together, until he got reinstated. I don’t know how I
woulda told my dad.</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: Ah, Louanne… I wouldn’t go in there right
now.</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: Ah. Guess I’m pretty stupid when it comes
to men. I never learn, do I?</p>
<p><strong>bud</strong>: I think maybe men are just stupid when it comes
to you. If you ever feel like, ya know, just talkin’ sometime, gettin’ a
beer – let me know. My schedule’s pretty open.</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: Thanks, Bud Give him these, will ya?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Get up. I wanta talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Don’t sit up. Stand up. If you can.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What’s the matter, Joe? You won’t shake
hands with me. You don’t want me to see your hand, do you? So I guess
what I heard was true, huh? You been poundin’ the walls with your
passin’ hand, right? I tell you what, Joe, you want to hit somethin’,
hit me.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I said hit me. I’m the one who put you in
here. Don’t hit the damn wall. It ain’t the wall’s fault. Hit me! Go on,
hit me right now!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Who else you wanta hit, huh? you’re daddy
maybe? Cause he’s a no-show prick? Well, I’m a daddy, too, and not a
very good one at that. So just hit me instead! I’ll take your daddy’s
beatin’ for him. Go on, you want to. Hit me, damnit!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Hit me! I’m not gonna leave you alone until
you hit me. The guys’ll thank you. They’ve always wanted to do it. So do
it now, damnit! Do it!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: O.K., Joe, it’s o.k. I guess I need it more
than you do. You gotta quit beatin’ up on yourself. Let me see that
hand.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: It’s o.k. You can still throw with it, you
fuckin’ mook. Look, the nurses say this is the toughest time for you
right now. I thought I’d stick around a little, case you wanta play some
cards, pick a fight with the wall again, whatever…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: You don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Yes I do.</p>
<p><strong>patient</strong>: Hey, Joe, don’t you wanta watch the game?
It’s on cable.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>perry</strong>: E.S.U. on the strength of a 62 yard touchdown
run by freshman Darnell Jefferson, squeaked by the North Carolina
Tarheels today, 14 to 13, keeping their bowl hopes alive.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: E.S.U. hoping to get past a tough Iowa
Hawkeyes team in their last game before the return of star quarterback,
Joe Kane.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: I know you, motherfucker. You’re the prick
who got my little sister pregnant. We ain’t seen you around lately.
Where you been, huh? Answer me, motherfucker, or I’m gonna peel your
cap.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Shit, Lattimer…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Oh, no…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Oh, boy, this does not look good, Harmon.
They’re bringing the stretchers out…</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Oh, shit, oh shit, I’ll kill that
motherfucker. I’ll… Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Twelve seconds left, Iowa driving for the
winning touchdown. Fourth and goal at the one. E.S.U. trying to hold on
without their star middle linebacker, Alvin Mack.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Coach, you’ve lost two of your last
four.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Why do your teams seem to nose dive at the
end of the last couple seasons?</p>
<p><strong>coach winters</strong>: This was a tough loss, but this ain’t
any nose dive. We’ve had some key players out, but if we win next week,
we’ll still win the conference and go to a major bowl on New Year’s Day.
I mean, I know you guys can’t write, but I thought you could at least
count.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You look good, Alvin.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Yeh, I feel o.k.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Any of the guys been down yet?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: They called.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Hell, you know how football players are
about hospitals and injuries.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Yeh.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: I’m never gonna play again, am I?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Doctors aren’t always right, Alvin… but I
just want you to know… you’re the best defensive football player I ever
coached.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Congratulations. I’m proud of you, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I know you had a difficult time. Michigan
is easy, right? Bourbon is tough.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Scotch.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I got somethin’ for ya. Coupla round trip
tickets. Go see your dad. Get it cleaned up.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: I’m gonna have to take a test with the
coach right there. You sure you got somethin’ better than blockers?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Much better. This guy is foolproof. See ya
Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I wanta do something different for this
game. Try to maximize our speed, but keep you both in the lineup at the
same time. Ray, I’m moving you to fullback. Darnell, you’re startin’ at
tail.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Ray, you’ll be carrying the ball less and
blocking more, but they’ll still have to respect your running and
pass-catching ability. Not everybody can make a transition like this.
You think you can handle it?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Good. We can’t afford any hang dogs.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hello, Camille.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Hello, Joe. You allright now?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeh… yeh, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Good, I’m happy for you.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Camille, hold on, O.K.? I’m sorry that I didn’t
want… that I couldn’t see you.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: You couldn’t even talk to me. What happened
to “there’s somethin’ goin’ on between you and me”?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: C’mon, Camille, I was embarrassed. I
couldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I couldn’t understand why anybody would wanta
talk to me. Camille!</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: How ya doin’, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Joe! What’s this? They throw you out?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s dad</strong>: I heard about your little set-to. They
had it on the news here.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Yeh, they sent me to rehab.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s dad</strong>: We know what that’s worth. Your brother’s
been through it three times.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s dad</strong>: So what are you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’ve been thinking about some things, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s dad</strong>: That’s what that damn rehab’ll do. Make
you think about a lotta things you can’t do nothing’ about.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I kinda been wonderin’ why you never came to
any of my games. All those years.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s dad</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. I guess I didn’t wanta
make you nervous. You mighta tried too hard and screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Or I mighta done real well. Which woulda been
harder on you, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>joe’s dad</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Mighta made you feel bad. Like maybe it wasn’t
written someplace that we all gotta go on our ass. Like maybe you coulda
done somethin’ more, if you’de tried a little harder.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s dad</strong>: Or maybe I didn’t wanta see you gettin’
all excited, all pumped up with pride, when I knew one day it would all
come crashin’ down. Just like it did.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I think I spent the last couple years hopin’
I’d die before that day. But you know what Dad? That day came and I’m
still here. And I got one more game this year. I don’t know how well
I’ll play or even how much, but I want you there.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s dad</strong>: How would you feel introducing your drunk
dad to all your friends? You think about that?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I could live with it, if you could. Here’s a
ticket. Section 2, Row 6. Fifty yard line. If you don’t come, I’ll never
ask you again.</p>
<p><strong>joe’s dad</strong>: O.K., Joey. And good luck.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Hey, Autumn. How’s Ray?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Don’t know. Haven’t seen him since the night
I saw you. He’d been goin’ out.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Monica Lambert.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: You knew? Why didn’t you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Didn’t wanta win you over that way.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I just wondered how your studying was
comin’. You ready for tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: The test? I hope so. I been workin’ pretty
hard.</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Good… I talked to my dad last night.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Oh, yeah? How’s he doin?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Fine. We talked about you.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: I told him I’d gone out with you… I told him
I wished I could still go bowling.</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: He’s rusty. I doubt if we can start
him.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: He’s worse than that. He’s outa shape. All
right, that’s enough for today. Practice is cancelled. Everybody off the
field, but Kane. C’mon what the hell are you standin’ around lookin’ at?
Get outa here.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Didn’t do much while you were in there, did
ya?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Well, we didn’t exactly have a team…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You could’ve worked out on your own.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I had some other things to worry about…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Well, we’re gonna make up for lost time.
We’ll start by hoppin’ the steps.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Hoppin’ the steps?! What, you’re gonna punish
me now.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Don’t talk back to me, Joe. I’ll kick your
ass. I went easy on you, ’cause you had to get through detox, but that’s
out to sea now. You let this team down; you let this program down. Start
those steps. Right leg.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Now the left.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: 70 guys. 70 guys who busted their butts all
year. Because of you they might not win the conference. Because of you
they might not go to a bowl.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I didn’t wanna leave… I just screwed up…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You dogged on them.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: No, no I never dogged. I worked my ass off. I
played hard…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Then you shoulda stayed in shape. Keep
runnin’, dammit.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I always played hard. I gave my everything for
you. When you came to the Center, I thought you were really worried
about me. But you don’t give a shit. We’re all just a buncha sled dogs.
If you had another guy who could throw, you’da left me in the fuckin’
hospital. The only thing that matters is the program, the god-damn
program.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Nobody forced you to play football, Joe.
Not me, not the program, nobody. But when you sign on, you commit
yourself to pay the price, to do whatever it takes. Well, you haven’t
paid the price yet. You still owe this team. You owe this team big-
time. Get a shower.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: What’s this doin?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Takin’ doped urine outa your bladder and
puttin clean back in. Call it an oil change.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Gotta get it done today, boys. Gotta ring
that bell. 60 minutes. 60 minutes of mean. No prisoners. No mercy.
Nothin’ but snot bubbles. Gotta ring that bell, gotta ring that
Championship bell.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: Ding Motherfucking Dong!!</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Wolves movin’ left to right on your radio
dial. Looking to generate some offense. They’ve been up and down the
last few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>collins</strong>: 28 Thunder right. On go.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: So the Wolves defense has held after the
fumble, and the Yellow Jackets will opt for the field goal. Around a 34
yarder. Ball is down, it’s away, it’s long enough. And good! Georgia
Tech jumps out on top 3-0.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Collins back to pass, rushed, now fires out
in the flat. It’s picked off by Hill. Down the sideline. He’s gonna go
in untouched. Touchdown, Georgia Tech.</p>
<p><strong>lattimer</strong>: C’mon guys, we’re only down ten. Let’s get
our fuckin’ shit together.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: You missed that block on purpose, didn’t
you, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re full of shit. You fumble, you try to
blame me.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: It’s Autumn isn’t it? That’s what this is
all about.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The hell with Autumn. You just can’t take a
hit.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Don’t tell me who started it. I don’t care.
All I care about is this football team. We win together. We lose
together. So whatever your problem is, get over it. I don’t want any
more of this shit. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>darnell and ray</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: As for the rest of you guys. Here’s what I
think of the way you played.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Yellow Jackets’ locker</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Get warm, Joe. You’re startin’ the second
half.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: By the way… don’t let me see you miss
anymore blocks.</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Joe’s too tentative, too cautious out
there. He seems flat. Maybe we oughta give Collins another shot.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Joe just needs to get the feel back. He’ll
be allright.</p>
<p><strong>clayton</strong>: Sam, we can’t afford to wait…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I said he’ll be allright.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: 5:51 to go. Georgia Tech up 10 to nothing.
The Wolves are gonna have to find some offense in a hurry here. Their
defense has been keepin’ them in it.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Joe, I know that Rehab was good for you.
Got rid of a lotta bad habits. But what about the rest of you? What
happened to the Joe Kane that used to take command of this team, the Joe
Kane these guys i’d run through a bulldozer for? They put him out with
the trash? What are you waitin’ for, somebody to feel sorry for you
cause you’ve had some problems? Nobody in this stadium gives a shit.
It’s time to step up, Joe. Time to sit at the head of the Table.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: All right, we’ve held these guys up long
enough. Give me time back here, and I’ll rip ’em apart. 16 shift, green,
bolt. First sound.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Nice bit of scrambling by Kane to get it to
the four, but it’s gonna bring up fourth and goal. No doubt about it,
with 3:45 they’ve gotta go for it here, if they’re gonna get back in
this game.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Give it to me up the gut, Coach. They’ve been
ignoring me. I know I can score.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: No, we’re gonna go with the sweep.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: 28 Thunder right. On 2.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Monster block, man. Monster motherfuckin’
block.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: All right, defense. Let’s get evil. Kill ’em
all, let the paramedics sort ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: 1:11 and counting. Third and one. The Wolves
have got to stop them on this play if they’re gonna get the ball back. A
first down here and it’s all she wrote. E.S.U. is out of timeouts.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Time for 2 plays. If it’s not open in the
end zone, take the sideline. As the offense runs onto the field, Winters
checks the scoreboard. 17 seconds left. Georgia Tech 10. E.S.U. 7.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Ball on the Yellow Jacket 35. 17 seconds
left. Kane barking signals.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: Field goal here ties it, but a tie may not
get the Wolves into a bowl. Tough decision for Winters.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You want me to send in the kicking team or
you think you can handle it?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Give me the ball.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: O.K., let’s do 24 inside slot, left blue
lightning.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: O.K., 24 inside slot, left blue lightning.
Let’s put the women and children to bed, and go lookin’ for fuckin’
dinner. On 2.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: This one’s for you, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>chairman</strong>: Looks like the Timberwolves are back.
Probably brought the library with them.</p>
<p><strong>chancellor</strong>: Hope so. Give my sincere congratulations
to Coach Winters.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: He’ll be delighted.</p>
<p><strong>fat cat alumnus</strong>: 15,10, touchdown!</p>
<p><strong>autumn</strong>: Daddy, you remember Darnell.</p>
<p><strong>mr. haley</strong>: Yes, I do. Great catch, Darnell.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: Thank you, sir. I got somethin’ for
you.</p>
<p><strong>darnell</strong>: My entrance exam. Got a 92. Coach Winters
said you got an 87. He looked it up.</p>
<p><strong>mr. haley</strong>: I’ll kill him.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Hell of a throw, Joe. Good to see you
back.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: And don’t worry about the Heisman. We’ll
gear up for it next year.</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: You still feel like gettin’ a beer?</p>
<p><strong>louanne</strong>: He’s not a football player any more. He’s
graduating this year.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: He’s still got a bowl game.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: So make sure he doesn’t violate curfew.</p>
<p><strong>harvey</strong>: An amazing conclusion to a great season. We
can see Steve Lattimer down on the bench weeping tears of joy as E.S.U.
goes back to a bowl for the first time in three years.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: What are you doin’ here?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Waitin’ for you. I figured you’de have to come
through here on your way to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: Shouldn’t you be out celebrating? You
played real well.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I need your help with somethin’. I know I’m not
your favorite guy right now, but it’s all startin’ again. The
expectations, the pressure, the talk about the Heisman next year. I was
wonderin’ if you’de like to go somewhere, maybe share a six-pack with
me?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I miss you, Camille. I don’t like bein’ without
you.</p>
<p><strong>camille</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>humes</strong>: Tickets are in your coat. Itinerary and
player profiles in the briefcase. We got a 9:00am tomorrow in Baltimore
with the kid from Park. Then we’re on to…</p>
