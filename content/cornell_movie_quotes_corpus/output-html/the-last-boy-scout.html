<p><strong>the last boy scout</strong>: written</p>
<p><strong>int. dark bedroom</strong>: The only light, that of a
flickering TV screen. A big MAN lies, shirtless, on the bed. Watching a
sports program. We hear:</p>
<p><strong>sports figure</strong>: Eliminating the draft? Worst thing
ever happened to pro football. Already you got Eric Dickerson, no team’s
good enough for him… You got Dion Sanders, this guy, Bosworth, bunch of
peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him play for 25 bucks a game. And he woulda
played for free, you get me? He loved the game. Nowadays? Forget about
it.</p>
<p><strong>man on bed</strong>: Hello…?</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Hello, Billy. Do you know who this is?</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Kid from Ohio is looking real good,
Billie…</p>
<p><strong>man on bed</strong>: I’m… I’m gonna… try real hard…</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: No, Billy. What you’re gonna do … is rush for
150 yards against Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>man on bed</strong>: That’s… too much. I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: You can. And you will. This is a business,
Billy. You don’t make one fifty, you’re history, the kid steps in. No
more job… and no more pills, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>man on bed</strong>: Please… Just give me time…</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: One hundred and fifty yards. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>aerial shot - snowstorm</strong>: OVER Chicago, Illinois, as
the CAMERA SPIRALS DOWN TOWARD a teeming football stadium. We hear crowd
noise and marching band music, deafeningly loud, as we SUPERIMPOSE the
legend:</p>
<p><strong>int. announcer’s booth</strong>: The BROADCAST TEAM huddles
inside the quilted jackets, squinting through the snow. Speaking into
headset mikes.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Good afternoon and welcome to Soldier
Field, Chicago, site of today’s confrontation between the L.A. Stallions
and the Chicago Bears. This is Vern Lindquist with Terry Bradshaw, and,
yes, my friends, it is that cold.</p>
<p><strong>int. locker room - same time</strong>: Billy Cole sits,
alone, in front of his locker. Eyes glazed. Face bathed in sweat. He
takes a bottle of pills from the locker. Pops three. Hisses a stream of
air through his teeth as we –</p>
<p><strong>ext. football field - day</strong>: A deafening CRUNCH as a
defensive back hammers a wide receiver, nearly decapitates him. The ball
rolls free. The back recovers it.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: … Big Ray Walton puts a devastating hit
on Bricmont, so Chicago turns over the ball with a minute and forty
seconds left.</p>
<p><strong>ext. sidelines - same time</strong>: The injured player goes
by on a stretcher, moaning. Cheerleaders jump and frolic.</p>
<p><strong>billy cole</strong>: gets up off the bench. The rest of the
offensive unit sprints onto the field. Cole walks. Straight ahead, eyes
front. Like a robot. His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the soundtrack.</p>
<p><strong>color man</strong>: And so L.A. has a chance to ice the game,
no pun intended… And you gotta be thinking, give the ball to Billy Cole.
He has had an outstanding day, racking up 138 yards against a tough
defense.</p>
<p><strong>down on field</strong>: The huddle breaks. The L.A. team
trudges through the snow to the line of scrimmage. Cole adopts a
three-point stance. Everything happens in hyper-real SLOW MOTION: The
snow falls. The receivers breeze past, in motion to begin their
patterns. Moving like gazelles. Cole’s fingers paw the cold earth.
Gouging it. He is like a spring. Coiled and ready. The ball is snapped.
Turf and snow. Erupting. A firecracker series of POPS as linemen
collide. Legs churning.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The ball floats through the snowy air.
Pitch-out to Cole. He takes it on the run. Tucks it under his arm.
Behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled. Cole turns the
corner. Picks up a blocker. Feet pounding. Arms pumping. Up ahead, the
free safety barrels toward him. Low and hard. Cole does not blink. He
reaches beneath his jersey. Pulls out a GUN. Pumps THREE SHOTS into the
free safety’s head.</p>
<p><strong>police</strong>: are on the field now. Running full out.
They’ve got riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the snow.
Cole crosses the goal line. Touchdown. Drops the ball. Turns, facing the
cops. His eyes are insane. The crowd is screaming. People are running
back and forth like extras in the Keystone Cops. The first TWO BLASTS
from the cops’ RIOT GUNS go high and wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base
of the goalpost. The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing
like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice. Cole is
oblivious to the bars crashing around him. He smiles and says:</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’m going to Disneyland…</p>
<p><strong>ext. l.a. street - in shadow of freeway - morning</strong>:
We SUPERIMPOSE the legend:</p>
<p><strong>west los angeles, california december 20</strong>: Good
morning, Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the ships at sea. Welcome to
another lackluster morning in Southern California. Palm trees limp.
Windless silence. 80 degrees at 8:00 AM. CAMERA CRANES DOWN PAST a huge,
rotting billboard. On the billboard, a girl in tight jeans. Grabbing her
own butt. A surprised look on her face. Yes, honey, that’s your butt.
MOVE IN ON a tiny, weather-beaten bungalow. In the shadow of the 405
Freeway. A shingle hangs from a wrought iron post: JOSEPH R. HALLENBECK,
CONFIDENTIAL</p>
<p><strong>investigations.</strong>: On the lawn, a late-model Plymouth.
The sprinkers come to life. Fling water across the car.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Inside the car, a lone man is asleep,
arms akimbo. Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams
V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music. Picture the tiredest, meanest,
grouchiest son of a bitch self-hating loser you can. Now give him a
two-year-old suit from C &amp; R Clothing. Such is the aforementioned
HALLENBECK.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: THREE neighborhood KIDS have gathered
around the car. Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk. One tosses a
baseball from hand to hand. One picks his nose.</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: Dude’s trashed.</p>
<p><strong>kid #2</strong>: Shit, we should do something to him.</p>
<p><strong>kid #3</strong>: I know where there’s a dead squirrel.</p>
<p><strong>later</strong>: with a tail sticking out. The youngest Kid
holds it aloft reverently. Looks in the open car window at Hallenbeck.
Still snoozing. Dead to the world.</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Hallenbeck snores. The mashed
squirrel perches on his chest. A shadow falls across him as –</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: return, scratching their heads. Staring in at
him.</p>
<p><strong>kid #2</strong>: Goddamn. Dude’s trashed.</p>
<p><strong>kid #3</strong>: Take his bottle.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and
stuffs a .38 revolver in the Kid’s face and cocks it.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hey, motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>kid #3</strong>: I’m not scared.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You’re on my property, kid.</p>
<p><strong>kid #3</strong>: Sidewalk belongs to the government.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>ext. malibu beach front - morning</strong>: A redwood beach
house, mellow in the morning sun. There was a party here last night.
Banners. Balloons and streamers. Tawdry in the light of day.</p>
<p><strong>int. beach house - same time</strong>: A plush bedroom. Sun
streams in the window. A YOUNG MAN sits, straddling a backwards chair.
Bare- foot, bare-chested. Blond hair, perfect tan. He is nursing a beer.
Smoking and staring at –</p>
<p><strong>bed</strong>: where a tawny golden girl lies, serene and
innocent. Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast exposed. No
tan line. The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the sleeping
girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old, former National League
heartthrob. He shakes his head and mutters:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Jesus, kid, if only you weren’t so damn
ugly.</p>
<p><strong>flashback - football field</strong>: Seventy thousand people
screaming. Jimmy in the middle. Younger Jimmy. Fresher Jimmy. It’s a
night game at the Coliseum. He’s the quarterback. The snap. Jimmy fakes
the draw. Rolls right. Around him, all is impact. Sound and fury. He
targets a receiver and unleashes a rocket. Sixty- yard toss, hits the
guy between the numbers.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s face</strong>: Covered with dirt and mud. Blood, too.
Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he’s alive. He makes a
difference.</p>
<p><strong>back to present</strong>: Alone in the bathroom… leaning on
the counter. Head down. A voice calls softly from the bedroom:</p>
<p><strong>sleepy voice</strong>: Jimmy, are you still here…?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. I guess I am.</p>
<p><strong>int. west l.a. bungalow - morning</strong>: Hallenbeck opens
the door and shambles in. Dark. Depressing. Sprawl of furniture. Stack
after stack of sports magazines. Drop all your belongings out of a
plane. They will land like this. He flicks on the light. Crosses to the
couch and flops down. Plucks a bottle of aspirin from an end table. Next
to the bottle, we see –</p>
<p><strong>two framed photographs</strong>: side by side. In one,
younger Hallenbeck is kissing younger bride. Smiling. In the other, the
President of the United States presents Hallenbeck with a medal. They
are both smiling beneath the Presidential Seal.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Hallenbeck scowls and chews three
aspirin. Swallows. The PHONE RINGS. He groans. Chain-lights another
smoke, stubs out his old one. Chins the receiver and says:</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hallenbeck Investigations.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Hey, Joe, Mike Miller over at Swerdlow. You
got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Mmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Mmmmm? What’s mmmmm? Jeez, you sound fucking
terrific. What’d you do last night?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Sat in the car. Looked at the sky. Got
hammered.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: How bad?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I killed a squirrel and don’t even
remember.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: That’s bad, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Tell me about it. Look, I crawled out of
a perfectly good bottle to answer the phone, what the fuck do you
want?</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Still takin’ charity?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: No pride here. What’cha got?</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Stripper in West Hollywood. Lives alone. Very
hot. A three on my finger scale. Means I’d cut off three of my fingers
if God would let me sleep with her.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Make her a one on your nose scale.
Improve your looks.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Eat me. Deal is this: She’s got a psycho,
threatens her over the phone. I’m gonna rape you, cut you, the usual
crap.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: She thinks he’s following her. I’m up to here,
you got plans?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I was gonna smoke some cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Can you postpone?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: These are really good cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: She goes onstage at seven. It’s two hundred
bucks, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Gimmee the address.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Terrific. And, Joe, big favor, okay? Try to…
fix yourself up, if you can manage it. Look the part. Not like the last
time, okay?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Gimmee the address.</p>
<p><strong>ext. bungalow - morning</strong>: Hallenbeck emerges into the
blinding glare. His tie is crooked. His cuffs are too short. He looks
like a grouchy bear. He looks up at the girl on the billboard.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: ’Morning, gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Nobody likes you. Everybody hates you.
You’re an asshole and you’re stupid. You’re gonna lose. Smile, you
fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: ’Morning, boys.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Hey, Jimmy. You want some of this?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, man. Why do you think they call it dope?
Henry, did I do anything last night that I should know about?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You puked a couple times. Pointed at some
lady’s tits. Chased a dog for a half an hour. Fucked a congressman’s
daughter, shit on someone’s car.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, man, I meant something bad, that I should
know about.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Mmmm. Nope. My ass hurts, I think I had gay
sex last night. I don’t remember. When are you gonna come look at my gun
collection?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Soon, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Are you Jimmy Dix? Played for the
Stallions?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: ’86 and ’87, that was me.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: Hell, I think the league gave you a raw
deal.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Thanks. What the hell, shit floats. I’ll be
back.</p>
<p><strong>player</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - minutes later</strong>: Jimmy is seated in
the devastated living room. Putting on shoes. He hears a COMMOTION
outside: A woman scream- ing. Water splashing. He frowns, puzzled. Gets
up. Pads out onto a redwood deck.</p>
<p><strong>ext. redwood deck - same</strong>: A six-foot behemoth is
seated in a jacuzzi at the far end of the deck. He is dunking a
terrified female head under the water and laughing. Jimmy clears his
throat.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ho. Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What the fuck you want, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s with the girl?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Bitch won’t blow me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Too early in the morning, Ray. Let her
go.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Fuck you. She’s not coming up till she starts
blowing.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ray. Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Fuck you, loser. What are you doing at a league
party, asshole? You and ol’ Dex Manley should get together, swap stories
about gettin’ booted.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ray, she’s gonna drown.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Not if she blows me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Last chance, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Go spit.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Get out of here. Go.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Best arm in the National League, you son of a
bitch. Remember that.</p>
<p><strong>ext. coast highway - day</strong>: Jimmy gets into the car.
Takes out his vial. Spoons some powder, sucks it up. A voice in the
background: “Hey, someone shit on my car!”</p>
<p><strong>ext. suburban neighborhood - day</strong>: Joe Hallenbeck
slides his Plymouth to the curb in front of a cozy stucco dwelling. Gets
out, crosses the lawn. A fat NEIGHBOR is watering shrubs next door. He
waves.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: ’Morning, Joe, how’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: My ears are burning, Andy. Even as we
speak, someone, somewhere is calling me an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: You’re funny.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m playing Tahoe on the 15th.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallenbeck’s house - same time</strong>: Hallenbeck
enters and crosses the living room. A woman, forty-ish, once beautiful,
appears in the bedroom doorway. Wearing a terry cloth robe. This is
Joe’s wife</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I thought you were in Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I was.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where did you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Office.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hey, Furry Tom.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How much did you lose?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I wasn’t there to gamble. I was doing a
skip trace.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How much did you lose?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Darian’s class drew holiday pictures. That
was hers. Her teacher wants to see us, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>close on drawing</strong>: It’s a picture of Santa Claus,
except this Santa has long, stringy hair, bloodshot eyes, and grotesque
talons. A little girl’s severed head is clutched in one hand.
Underneath, in block capitals, is written: SATAN CLAUS.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Satan Claus. Kid’s got some talent,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s hideous.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You okay, Sarah…?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m tense. I couldn’t get to sleep last
night.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hmmmm. Well, I think the kid will be
fine. Boys still tease her about the headgear?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you kidding? Brace Face, that’s the
latest. Little bastards.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: She’ll be fucking them by the time she’s
fourteen.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Well, Christ, you let her wear enough
makeup. The kid looks like a goddamn raccoon. She comes in late at
night, I think, ‘Christ, a burglar.’ I almost shot her twice.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re not funny. All the girls at that
school wear makeup.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah, but they don’t apply it with a
paint sprayer. And for your information, our neighbors think I’m very
funny.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Go live with them.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Don’t tempt me.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Damn raccoon.</p>
<p><strong>int. bedroom</strong>: He kneels, looks under the bed.
Frowns. Straightens and says, very conversationally:</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Who’s the guy in the closet?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Oh, that’s right, you sometimes forget
that I’m a detective. See, first I noticed how tense you were, but I let
that pass. Then I noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was
just in there, but meanwhile your hair is completely dry, you follow?
So. Why the steamy shower?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Because someone else was in there,
right, and since he’s not under the bed you must have stuck him in the
closet when you heard my key in the door a day early. Tah-dah. Please,
no applause.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well, nothing changes. You’re still a
lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Mmmmm. I’m sorry, honey, I don’t enjoy
being observant, but someone’s gotta do it. What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Please leave. I have to get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: It’s okay, I’ve seen you naked. So,
apparently, has someone else. What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You want me to open the closet, Joe? Huh? You
want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, I’ll throw the door open, is
that what you want me to do…?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Is this a trick question?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ll do it, Joe. Okay? And then we’ll both
know you’re a psycho, is that what you want? Huh??</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: No. We won’t open the door.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Nope. Door stays shut. Instead, what I’m
gonna do is… … I’m gonna count to three, and then I’m gonna put a bullet
in there, and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth. One.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: If you shoot up my house, Joe, I will make
you eat that gun.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Two. The truth is a beautiful thing.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Call your shrink, Joe. I still have the
number. Call him and tell him you’re losing it, I cannot fucking deal
with you like this – !</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Three. Last chance.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Joe, dammit – !</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jesus, no – !</p>
<p><strong>closet door</strong>: swings slowly open, then… And out steps
a man in a bathrobe. Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet. None other
than MIKE MILLER, Joe’s early morning phone call. We know this because
Joe says:</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hello, Mike. Keeping her warm for
me?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Easy, Joe. Don’t do nothing dumb.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: How as she, Mike? On your finger scale,
how was my wife…?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: It just happened, Joe. It just happened.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You call me from here this morning?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: She said you were in Vegas. I was gonna
leave a message on the machine.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: When you found out I was back. Why
didn’t you split?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: She said relax, he never stops home once
he’s in the office.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Normally I wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: You knew?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I suspected. So how about it, Mike? On a
scale of one to ten. How was she?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Joe, come on, how long we been friends,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: How long? Mmm. I’d say roughly until you
put your dick in my wife.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: You gotta understand –</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I know, I know, it just happened. It was
an accident. Sure. You tripped. You said, ‘Whoops,’ and accidentally
fucked my wife. Gee, Mrs. H., I’m sorry, just isn’t my week. Sure, Mike.
Happen to anybody. I don’t gotta understand anything.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Put the gun down.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hmmm? Oh, right, the gun. You’re right,
Sarah, I’m acting nuts.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Where was Darian?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: She stayed at Cindy’s last night.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Let’s take a walk, Buddy.</p>
<p><strong>ext. suburban street - day</strong>: The two men come out the
back door and cut through the hedge.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Miller’s car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is
parked at the curb. Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone’s yard.
Holsters his gun. A neighbor’s dog approaches, happily wagging its tail.
Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Where you want it, Mike? Head or
gut?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Listen, Joe, I – Gut.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: If I see you again, I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: So. West Hollywood at seven, right?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Huh…?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The job. Seven o’clock, right?</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: You still… want the job…?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: It’s two hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: Yeah. I guess it is.</p>
<p><strong>miller</strong>: I’m sorry, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hallenbeck says nothing. Miller turns
and stumbles to his car. Hallenbeck’s face betrays nothing. A dead mask.
He walks back toward the hedge. The neighbor’s dog runs up, a tennis
ball in its mouth. Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird.
Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. Throws it. The DOG BARKS and bounds
after it. Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition. The CAR BLOWS to
pieces. An ERUPTION OF FLAME. Flying glass and metal. The car becomes
airborne. Engulfed in fire. Does a lazy spin. Comes down. The shockwave
catches Hallenbeck. Slams him ass over teacups. Windows blow in up and
down the street. Smoke and fire roll to the sky. The DOG cowers, HOWLING
in fear. Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire. Hallenbeck
rolls to his feet. Covered with twigs and leaves. Clothing scorched.
Stares. Eyes glazed.</p>
<p><strong>ext. suburban street - an hour later</strong>: A mobile crane
hoists what’s left of Mike Miller and his Pontiac. Policemen direct
traffic, curb bystanders.</p>
<p><strong>off to one side</strong>: a UNIFORM COP questions Hallenbeck
and Sarah, who stand stiffly. Not looking at each other.</p>
<p><strong>uniform cop</strong>: Why did Mr. Miller visit your home this
morning, Mr. Hallenbeck?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: He came by to talk business. He had a
case he was to busy to continue with, a routine surveillance. He farmed
it out to me.</p>
<p><strong>uniform cop</strong>: I see. Is that all you talked
about?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>naked, gyrating body</strong>: Female, for the record.
Signaling us that we are now:</p>
<p><strong>int. “bottomless pit” club - night</strong>: Rowdy strip club
in West Hollywood. Just like the name suggests; if it’s a virus, you’re
sitting on it. After three drinks, every girl on stage looks like your
high school sweetheart. Was your sweetheart fat? Did she have excessive
body hair? FUNK MUSIC, played LOUD. The Monday crowd stomps and claps.
Onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm usually reserved for
standing in line at the DMV. Jimmy Dix sits at the bar, hooting and
whistling. Behind the bar, a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks.
His name is HARP. Off to one side, a twenty-five-year-old BEANPOLE
speaks into a microphone:</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: Flash of green buys a flash of pink,
gentlemen. So reach into your pockets if you aren’t there already, and
reward the lovely and talented Ms. Vixen…!</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: My son. He writes his own material, he’s proud
of that. Some people are proud, they cured leukemia. Old guy stops
beating off long enough to laugh, my son thinks he’s Eddie Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Alex the astronaut.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Alex the astronaut.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’ve had it, Harp.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Had what?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It, man. I’ve had it. I don’t remember what I
did last night. I’m an idiot, Harp, I act like a complete dickhead. I
don’t have friends. I drink too much. I fuck anything that’s warm and
breathing.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: Stay on that side of the bar.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I cheated on my girl friend again.</p>
<p><strong>harp</strong>: You cheated on her? You must be crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so.</p>
<p><strong>scantily-clad waitress</strong>: Who makes her way between
the tables. She is beautiful. Stands out like a teamster at a gay rights
rally. Supple body. Deep green eyes. Flaxen hair. Her name is CORY. She
stops at a table against the wall. Puts down a Seagrams V.O. in a rocks
glass. Seated at the table is a broad-shouldered man in a bad suit. The
essence of boredom. Looks like he’s been there three days. A cloud of
smoke hangs around his head. Mr. Joe Hallenbeck, no less.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The police won’t help you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: Sure. After I’m dead they’ll perform the
autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Guess you don’t want to wait that
long.</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: Guess not.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: They only play this kind of music?</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: What did you expect?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Pat Boone? The Four Freshmen?</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: What are you, my father?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yes, I’m your father. Get your clothes
on. I hate this funk shit. It’s gonna be an extra hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: You’re hilarious. Sit next to the speaker,
you’ll get used to it. After a while you’ll be screaming play that funky
music white boy.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The screaming part I believe.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She smiles and moves away. Hallenbeck
sips his drink. Scans the crowd with shrewd eyes.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: The lovely Cory approaches Jimmy at
the bar. Harp looks on.</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: Hello, handsome. How’d you like to buy me a
bottle of champagne?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How much for a bottle?</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: Forty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No thanks. Nothing personal, my seventh grade
teacher was killed by a drunk driver.</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: Tall guy? Sandy hair?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: I had to swerve three times to get him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ha-ha.</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: So no bottle, then?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: For forty bucks I’d rather drink my own
piss.</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: That’s extra.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hi, Cory. Rough night?</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: Arrgh. I’ve had it to here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’ll bet you have.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who’s the stiff?</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: He’s nobody. I have to get ready to dance.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come back soon. I want to buy you a
drink.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Near the stage, the would-be Eddie
Murphy steps up to the mike and says:</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: You know, crowd, these ladies are fine, but
let me tell you the three reasons men prefer sheep: they’re always in
the mood, they never bitch, and after you fuck ’em you can eat ’em.</p>
<p><strong>emcee</strong>: And now, here’s a lady that’s always in the
mood, put your hands together for the lovely and talented Ms. Cory…!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Her body is exquisite. She moves like
breath. Her eyes can put you under. She is simply that beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: sits with his drink untouched before
him. Pats his suit pockets, searching for a smoke. Removes a crumpled,
empty pack, as:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy dix</strong>: saunters up, looking less than friendly.
He looks at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck does not look at him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hi. You’re nobody.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Shhh. Don’t tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s what Cory said. She said you were
nobody.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Easy, Junior, I’m not raining on your
parade. She’s too young for me. I’m just keeping an eye on her for a few
days.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I see. What are you, some kind of
bodyguard?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Something like that. You got a
cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No. Is Cory in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I hope not. You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She didn’t mention anything to me.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Mmmm. That bothers you, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Don’t sweat it. Women have secrets.
Water is wet, the sky is blue, and women have secrets. I’ll buy you a
beer. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She hired you, huh? What, you in the
phonebook?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah. Actually, she hired my buddy Mike.
I’m filling in.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where’s Mike?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: He died.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sorry to hear it.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Don’t be. He was a lousy surveillance
man.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Look, friend, I don’t know who you are or
what’s going on. But Cory is my girl friend and if she’s in trouble, I
want to hear about it.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: That’s client confidential.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tell me anyway.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I say two words to Cory and you don’t get
paid, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You sure? I’m looking at your suit, you could
use the dough.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You don’t like my suit, guess what? I
don’t like your money.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Good, ’cause you’re not getting any.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Story of my life.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Not getting any.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You couldn’t protect a cup of warm piss.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hit me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hit me. Bust me in the chops,
chickenshit. You’re not afraid, are you, Jimmy…?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: James Alexander Dix, L.A. Stallions, ’86
and ’87. Barred from the N.F.L. on gambling charges. Allegations of
point shaving to support a cocaine habit, never proven.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Busted once for possession. You had the
makings of a first class dumbshit.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mister… You are now pissing me off.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: About fucking time. Joe Hallenbeck. I’m
a private detective.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know, Joe… You look like a dumb wop
to me.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: At least I didn’t shit my talent away on
coke, motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Can I hit you now?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Please, have a seat.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You think you’re some kind of hot shit tough
guy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: It’s not a question of tough. I’m bigger
than you, and I was trained. So I can take you. That’s just the way it
is. You can throw a better pass. How about that beer?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Piss off.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You were a great quarterback, Jimmy. I
watched you play at Washington State. Red shirt freshman in ’82.
Followed you with the Stallions. Good scrambling ability, seventy
percent completions from the pocket… You had the best gun in the
N.F.L.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. Thanks. I guess.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hell. I’m a fan.</p>
<p><strong>angle on stage</strong>: Onstage, the MUSIC GRINDS TO a CLOSE
as Cory dispenses with the last of her clothing. Strikes a pose to wild
applause and we HOLD ON her radiant beauty and –</p>
<p>****: I think we lost her back at the Jacuzzi blowjob</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Suffice to say, they fog the screen. At
last, Jimmy rolls over and pours champagne into two crystal glasses.
Lifts one in a toast.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Alex the pediatrician.</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: Alex the pediatrician.</p>
<p><strong>int. backstage corridor - same time</strong>: Joe Hallenbeck
is pounding an already-dented cigarette machine. No dice. It has eaten
his money. He shakes his head, muttering. Looks at his watch. Looks at
the dressing room door. Shakes his head again. Walks to the end of the
corridor. Goes through the fire door. Out into:</p>
<p><strong>ext. parking lot - continuous action</strong>: Starry,
moonlit night. A chill breeze. Joe draws a breath. In front of him, on
the wall of the club, is a poster: BAYNARD FOR SENATE, it reads. Above
the logo, a picture of a benevolent-looking gray-haired man. Hallenbeck
regards it balefully.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I didn’t vote for you, you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You’re a fuckin’ lowlife, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He bends to pick up the butt. A steel
sap whistles over his head, missing by inches. Hallenbeck spins,
startled. Reflexively lashes out with a flattened palm. Misses, chops
the air. Two more men, behind him. Nowhere to go. A sap pops him behind
the left ear. A sickening thud. The world spins out of focus. He goes
down. Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks. Rolls over, staring up.
Vision muddy, indistinct.</p>
<p><strong>hitman #1</strong>: That’s him. He was with her.</p>
<p><strong>hitman #2</strong>: Shit, he’s packing. What should we
do?</p>
<p><strong>hitman #3</strong>: Get him away from here. Then kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>hitman #2</strong>: There’s no contract for him.</p>
<p><strong>hitman #3</strong>: Then do it for free. Just do it
elsewhere.</p>
<p><strong>hitman #2</strong>: Start walking. I’m right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: The two other Hitmen return to their
gray, late-model sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the
nightclub. Waiting.</p>
<p><strong>ext. vacant lot - night</strong>: A rusty chain-link fence
separates the lot from the boule- vard. Choked with weeds. Broken glass.
A rusted-out car. A towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people
to drink Scotch or get laid, it’s hard to tell. Hallenbeck staggers
drunkenly across the lot. The crag-faced man follows behind him.</p>
<p><strong>crag-face</strong>: Wrong place at the wrong time, buddy,
that’s all it is. Just want you to know it’s nothing personal.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: That’s what you think. Last night I
fucked your wife.</p>
<p><strong>crag-face</strong>: Oh, you did, huh? How’d you know it was
my wife?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: She said her husband was a greaseball
with bad breath.</p>
<p><strong>crag-face</strong>: You’re pretty cool for a guy gonna take a
bullet.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: After fucking your wife, I’ll take
two.</p>
<p><strong>crag-face</strong>: You’re a funny guy. It’s a shame to take
you off. Here, kneel down.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Are you kidding? We barely know each
other.</p>
<p><strong>crag-face</strong>: This is wild. I never shot no funny guy
before.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You need a special funny bullet.</p>
<p><strong>crag-face</strong>: Come on, cut it out. Head or chest?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: That’s what your wife said.</p>
<p><strong>crag-face</strong>: Would you quit with the wife? Enough is
enough.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Ask me how fat she is.</p>
<p><strong>crag-face</strong>: How fat is she?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: She’s so fat I had to roll her in flour
and look for the wet spot. You wanna fuck her, you gotta slap her thigh
and ride the wave in. Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except when you poke
her in the stomach, she farts. I got a buddy he’s an archaeologist,
organized an expedition to her chin. They got lost in her nasal hair.
But seriously, her eyes are like the streets of Paris: crossed. They’re
so crossed when she cries the tears run down her back. She’s got
back-tearia.</p>
<p><strong>crag-face</strong>: Oh, that’s awful. Buddy, you’re a fucking
rio –</p>
<p><strong>crag-face</strong>: Bastard.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: And then some.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m playing Tahoe on the 15th.</p>
<p><strong>ext. strip club - night</strong>: Cory and Jimmy emerge from
the club into the parking lot. She scans the area, shaking her head.</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: I can’t believe it. The bastard split on me.
I’m staying at a motel for a couple days. Will you follow me?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: The Hitmen wait in the darkened
sedan. Watching Jimmy and Cory. The driver keys the ignition. Starts the
car. In his lap is an automatic rifle.</p>
<p><strong>ext. boulevard - night</strong>: Joe Hallenbeck is running
full out. Headlong down the sidewalk. Gasping for breath.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Move!!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He slams into a man. Knocks him flat.
Groceries fly. Joe doesn’t care. He stumbles. Keeps going.</p>
<p><strong>ext. nighttime street - same time</strong>: Jimmy Dix is
behind the wheel of a silver Jag. Cory is driving a spanking new Ford
Fiero. Jimmy follows behind Cory, watchdogging. Humming with JOE COCKER
on the RADIO. Cory comes to a red light. Pauses. Turns right onto a
sidestreet. Jimmy slows, pausing at the intersection.</p>
<p><strong>gray sedan</strong>: passes Jimmy. Accelerating. ENGINE
REVVING. Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car. It’s enough:
Everyone inside is armed to the teeth. The SEDAN ROARS around the
corner, cutting in front of Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh God. This is a hit this is a fucking
hit!!</p>
<p><strong>gray sedan</strong>: comes up behind Cory. Comes up fast.
Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops
the clutch – And stalls out. He roars with anger. Flings open the door.
Leaps out and runs forward, screaming:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Cory, get out of there!!</p>
<p><strong>cory</strong>: Hey, can’t you fucking drive??</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Her eyes go wide with shock. The Hitmen
burst from their car. OPEN UP on full auto. Cory is cut down. Blown
backward over the hood of her Ford. Flung to the street.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh Gooood!!</p>
<p><strong>two hitmen</strong>: move toward him, triggering THREE SHOT
BURSTS. The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without warning
–</p>
<p><strong>joe hallenbeck</strong>: charges into the intersection.
Screaming bloody murder. He’s got a GUN in each fist, and both are
BLAZING. One Hitman dies immediately: Dances like a puppet, racked by
gunfire. Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan’s WINDSHIELD.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Shatters the Hitman between the two
cars… And holy Christ, the guy’s still alive. Pinned like a butterfly,
legs broken… He raises his rifle, screaming. Jimmy dives flat on the
front seat. The WINDSHIELD ERUPTS. The Hitman. Still pinned. Still
screaming. He FIRES SHOT AFTER SHOT into Jimmy’s car. Hallenbeck walks
up behind him. Puts a BULLET in his head. He stops screaming.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: is still huddled on the front seat in a sea
of broken glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hey. Back up.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car
backs up. Steam pouring from the crumpled hood. The Hitman, now freed,
collapses to the street. Like a sack of flour.</p>
<p><strong>motel manager</strong>: stands outside a door marked OFFICE.
Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck nods at
the bodies in the street.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: It’s all over, compadre.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Get off my property, mister.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Sidewalk belongs to the government.</p>
<p><strong>police cruisers</strong>: come SQUEALING up, flashers
turning. Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless – And
Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon.</p>
<p><strong>int. police station - night</strong>: SERGEANT BENJAMIN
BESSALO sits behind his desk, scanning a stack of typed pages. A
tired-looking cop named McCASKEY lounges in the doorway. A Christmas
tree in the corner sheds needles.</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: Something stinks in here. My God, it’s this
statement! Sarge?</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: It’s shit. Hallenbeck is hiding
something.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: McCASKEY</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: I know how the bastard’s mind works. Every
lie has eighty percent truth to it. Guy scares me. We lookin’ at the
same guy?</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: Go ahead. Tell me what you see. I see a
guy, looks like he just slept in his suit.</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: Yep. That’s what most people see. There’s
more?</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: Oh, yeah. There’s more. A long time ago,
that son of a bitch saved the President’s life.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That stuff Cory fed you about a weirdo
hassling her. That was all bullshit, wasn’t it…?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah. I don’t know what she was into,
but those were professional hitters tonight. Mob style. Tell me about
Cory. What was she like?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: None of your fucking business.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Listen up, friend. I’m trying to get a
handle on this. How was she fixed for money?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know. Pretty strapped, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Always kept an eye out for work?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No hooking, if that’s what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: It isn’t. Tell me what she did at the
club, besides dance.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The usual. Waitressing. Get a guy to buy you
a bottle of champagne. Sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill
his troubles. Used to say she’d make a great psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: She get many high rollers?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sure. Even rich guys get lonely.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Fine. So suppose one night, her ‘guest’
gets a little too drunk, and brags to her… reveals something about
himself. Something that could hurt if it came out. What would she
do?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Would she blackmail him?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Jesus, I’ve had about enough of you –</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Would she consider the possibility of
blackmail?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She’d consider it. If she could get away with
it. But she’d need hard evidence. Otherwise, it’s ‘I never said that,’
his word against hers.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Right. So what does she do?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t know. Follow the guy? Have him
followed?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Bingo. Kid, this is making sense. She
hires somebody to follow the mark and obtain blackmail evidence.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who does she hire?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Ah. She hires my buddy Mike. Right?
Right. It makes sense. Except –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Except you told me that Mike was a shitty
surveillance man.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Exactly. He got spotted. They made him,
and they killed him. Then they took out Cory.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Christ, what did the two of them stumble
onto?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Whatever it was, it was way over their
heads. They knew they were in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How you figure?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Because Mike was scared. He bailed out
and threw the case in my lap.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He handed it to you… without telling you how
dangerous it was?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: He was fucking my wife, Jimmy. I die. He
gets my wife.</p>
<p><strong>int. property room - night</strong>: Hallenbeck is collecting
his firearm from the property clerk. Jimmy lounges against the wall.
Winks at a hooker as she goes by in the hall, followed by a patrol cop.
Jimmy eyes his rumpled trousers. Ripped shirt.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shit. This shirt cost me eighty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Glad to see, at a time like this, at
least you got your priorities straight.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Do me a favor and shut up. You think I don’t
care that Cory’s dead? Christ, I feel like I been rode hard and put away
wet.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wow. What stunning advice. I was gonna go
hiking.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know something, Joe, for a private eye,
you sure don’t go in for snappy comebacks.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: How’s this? Fuck you and the horse that
looks like you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: You look real familiar. Do I know
you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You might. Some people recognize me.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Got it. Peanuts Morton. Used to sell hash
in Crenshaw District.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, man. I played football. Jimmy Dix, L.A.
Stallions.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: What position?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>patrolman</strong>: Fuckin’ football. Free agents ruined the
damn game.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He walks away. Jimmy scowls. Grumbles to
himself.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: We gotta cross the parking lot. You
wanna borrow my sunglasses?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hey, snappy comeback. You a
detective?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: What the fuck are you trying to do,
Tarzan?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He hit the chick.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You don’t start a fight in a police
station, dickhead. Are you really this stupid or did you take
lessons?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Guy shouldn’t treat a woman like that, is all
I’m saying. He just shouldn’t, okay?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Why? Because they’re weak and need
protecting?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ext. police impound lot - same time</strong>: Hallenbeck
walks across the parking lot toward his car. Jimmy trots behind him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Mind if I catch a ride with you?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: My car’s fucked up, remember?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Take the bus.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Cut it out. Look, you sorta saved my life.
Let me buy you a beer.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m not thirsty. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s it. Good night?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Go home. Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m gonna get a message to the people
who killed your friend.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s the message?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: That we’re out of it. That whatever
they’re doing, they don’t have to worry about us.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re backing off, you’re not gonna do
anything? I watch T.V., what the fuck kind of private eye doesn’t do
anything?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The kind with a wife and kid. Look, it’s
over. My job is done.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck you your job is done. We witnessed a
murder, Joe!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yes, it was very exciting. Tomorow I’ll
take you to the zoo. You wanna play hero, go ahead. When you die, I’ll
take your closet full of eighty-dollar shirts.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Look, until this is over, I’m sticking with
you.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The hell you are.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m part of this. We do something, we do it
together.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Have a ncie night.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t drive away, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Joe – ! I’ll tell the cops, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Tell them what, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That Mike Miller was fucking your wife. Only
reason you’re not in the cooler, tough guy, is the cops got no motive
for Miller’s death. When they find out Mikey was dickin’ your old lady,
seems to me you become suspect numero uno. I’m scared, and I’m coming
with you, got it?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You little creep, I’m gonna beat the
shit out of you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Go for it. Then the cops’ll really love my
story. You don’t start a fight in a police station, dickhead.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You and me is not a fight. You and me is
a massacre.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Gosh, you’re tough.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Get in the fucking car.</p>
<p><strong>int. car - driving - night</strong>: Hallenbeck is in a foul
mood. Jimmy lights a cigarette and applies for a position as pep
chairman:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You got any hobbies?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Mmmm. Used to be a pretty fair
ventriloquist.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ventriloquist, really? I hear Ps and Bs are
the hardest.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah, well, actually –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, you got any tapes in here? Man, what is
this shit? Dick Haymes. Who the fuck is Dick Haymes? Jeez, you must be
older than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What’s the matter? Stomach problems?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Ear problems.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What kind of ear problems?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The kind that won’t shut up.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Baynard, huh? What’s the matter, you got some
kind of beef with the guy?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You might say that.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You wanna share with the class?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Bastard got me fired from my old
job.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah? What were you, cop or something?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Secret Service.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re high. Get outta here. Really…? You
protected the man? Holy shit, you musta got laid every night.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: That’s me. Every night. Where did Cory
live?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She had an apartment on the West Side.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I want to check it out.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I thought you were off the case.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Look, dipshit, I told you that to keep
you out of my hair. My client’s dead and I haven’t earned my fee.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Whoa, back up. You mean, we’re gonna nail
these fuckers after all…? Damn. I knew there was a hero lurking beneath
that gruff exterior.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah, I’m a prince. Shut the fuck
up.</p>
<p><strong>ext. adult living complex - night</strong>: Jimmy and
Hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk between tiny,
palm-shaded cottages. The moon casts a pale glow.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Bet these places run a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tell me about it. I’m paying the fucking
rent.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: How charming. Sounds like a great girl.
What else did you spring for? Clothes? Car payments?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Wasn’t like that. Cory could’ve had lots of
rich guys. Me, she loved.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Oh. Love. Well, forget about it,
then.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let me guess. You don’t believe in love.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I believe in cancer. I believe in
love.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What, they’re both diseases?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Man, I don’t want to meet the bitch that
fucked you up.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m sure she’d love meeting you.
Probably blow you on the front porch.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Little bitter, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Eat shit.</p>
<p><strong>ext. moonlit cottage</strong>: The two men approach the door.
Jimmy takes out his key ring.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The cops are gonna want to check this
place out, so don’t disturb anything.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes, massah.</p>
<p><strong>int. cottage</strong>: Jimmy opens the door. Flips on the
lights. Stops in his tracks. The room has been systematically torn to
pieces. A knife has been used to rip open the couch. Broken furniture,
shredded clothing. Everywhere. It looks like a combat zone.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think someone disturbed some stuff,
Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Well, shit. Looks like somebody beat us
to it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Beat us to what?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Whatever evidence Cory was holding.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Assuming there was any. Stay here a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Bathroom. You wanna come with me? Doctor said
I shouldn’t lift anything heavy.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>int. cluttered bathroom</strong>: Jimmy enters and shuts the
door behind him. He scans the floor, covered with clothes, bottles, etc.
Picks up a carelessly discarded can of Right Guard deodorant. Turns it
upside down, and unscrews the bottom. Inside, the can is hollow and
empty. The perfect hiding place. Jimmy heaves a sigh of relief. Removes
a little plastic Baggie filled with white powder. Stashes it in his
shorts. Starts to replace the lid. Stops. Frowns. Reaches into the can a
second time – And pulls out a yellow envelope. He looks at it,
perplexed. Puts it in his pocket. Replaces the lid. Tosses the can on
the floor. Flushes the toilet. Leaves.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room</strong>: Hallenbeck, meanwhile, is prowling
the living room, looking at photographs on the walls. The girl in the
photos seems young, beautiful, and naive. One shot depicts Cory and a
friend in cheerleader outfits. On it is scrawled, GOOD LUCK IN HOLLYWOOD
BABY! LOVE,</p>
<p><strong>janis</strong>: Hallenbeck gazes around the devastated
cottage.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Looks like you made it, baby.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Find anything?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah, there’s some really nice
rubble.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I may have something.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Later. Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>ext. cottage - night</strong>: The two men emerge from the
house. Joe heads for his car. Jimmy peels off toward a battered GMC
Pacer parked at the curb.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Where the hell are you going?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: As long as we’re here, I might as well take
Cory’s car.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You got the keys?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. I’ll follow you.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Cory has two cars?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah. This one’s just sitting here until she
can sell it.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Jimmy, no!!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ouch – ! What’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Hallenbeck kneels and peers under the
car.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Swears softly as he sees two thin copper
wires, glinting in the moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: They used a car bomb on Mike, it figures
they’d try it on her, too. Except they wired the wrong car.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh. Shit. Oh. Jeez.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Easy, kid. No harm, no foul. We caught
it in time.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Gotta disconnect the fucker.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn’t we call the bomb
squad or something?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Relax, Junior, I used to do this for a
living.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You wanna do it?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, man, I –</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Come on, chickenshit. Just snip the
wire.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Oh, shit not that one!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re a fucking asshole!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: And then some, Junior. And then
some.</p>
<p><strong>three sticks of dynamite - one minute later</strong>: have
been taped to the car’s ignition system. Hallenbeck removes the taped
bundle. Holds it up for inspection.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: We’ll hand this over to the cops. They
can analyze it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Great. So what now?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You tell me, kid.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Give up? Flee? Go really far away?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I got a better idea. Let’s check in with
my family.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m tired. You drive.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sure. Family, huh? You got kids?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah. Little girl.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Does she like you?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Not much, no. And she likes Prince, so
go figure.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I like Prince.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Great, you can marry my daughter. Or
better yet, fuck my wife. I hear all it takes is a credit card and two
valid I.D.’s. Open the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re just gonna stick that in your
trunk?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You’re right. Let’s leave it here for
the neighborhood kids to play with.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hold it right there, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>two men</strong>: are approaching from out of the trees. One
holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy. The other carries a
silenced Beretta.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Is it the cops?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: No, Jimmy. It’s not the cops.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Working quickly, Hallenbeck tapes the
bomb to the inside of the truck lid. Slams it shut. Turns, facing the
new arrivals. The MEN wear tailored suits with matching ties. One is
tall and lean. The other is a bruiser, short and stout. They both have
the seasoned look of professional mob hitters. The Taller Man speaks,
gun held rock steady.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late for a
stroll, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah, you two better be getting
home.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The streetlights are on.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: That’s amusing. How delightful to find
such amusing men so late at night. I don’t believe I’ve had the
pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: No, I don’t believe you have. He’d like
to have the pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Tell him it’s not for sale.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: He says it’s –</p>
<p><strong>short man</strong>: What’s your name, fuckface?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m asshole. He’s fuckface.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: Jake, apprise Rodney Dangerfield here of
his situation.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles.
Steps up and delivers a looping right to Hallenbeck’s face. A sickening
crunch. A two inch gash streams blood. Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his
gun.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: Perhaps we can dispense with the fun and
games now, yes?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Easy… Jim… All they want is the
evidence…</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: The evidence. Very smart. See, Jake, he
knows when a situation is untenable. You like that word?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Great word.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: It occurs to me that you may have the
evidence in question.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Give up, Jimmy. We’re dealing with
geniuses.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Leave him alone, you fuck!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Back off, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: Leave him alone…? Whatever you say.
Jake?</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: Ah, my young friend… I neglected to tell
you that Jake attacks his job with a certain… exuberance.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Christ… I’m being beat up by the inventor of
Scrabble.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: He’s still in a good mood, Jake. Kick him
again.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You want the fucking evidence that the
stripper had. I’ve got it. So we can play games, or I can hand it
over.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And then you’ll let us go, right?</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: Sure. We’ll let you go. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hand me the car keys, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: Walk over and hand him the keys. Slow and
easy.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The evidence is in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: Open it. Slow.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hallenbeck smiles. Shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Oops. I guess nobody gets it.</p>
<p><strong>tall man</strong>: You dumb bastard, you’re going to pay for
that. Jake, open the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>angle on hallenbeck</strong>: This is what he’s been waiting
for. He tenses, looking to one side: next to him is a sloping hillside,
angling down and away. He grips Jimmy’s wrist, signalling to get ready.
Jake raises the PISTOL. Take aim at the lock and FIRES. The SHOT is
SILENCED. What follows is not. Because the bullet blows through the
trunk – And hits three sticks of live dynamite.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: SOUND. Fury. Flames, rolling skyward.
TINKLE of raining GLASS. Bits of falling metal. All in all, a helluva
blast, and meanwhile:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy and joe</strong>: continue to careen down the hillside.
Bouncing like rag puppets. Out of control. Lurch to stop at the bottom.
Covered head to toe with dirt. Bruised. Bloody. Alive. They lie side by
side, sucking air – Until they both hear an odd noise: The sound of
CRUMPLING METAL. The sound is GETTING LOUDER. They both crane their
necks in time to see – The flaming car, tumbling end over end Coming
down the hill. Heading straight for them.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Jesus fucking Christ!</p>
<p><strong>on ground</strong>: Joe rolls over. Looks at Jimmy. Jimmy
looks at Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You alive?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Don’t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The dynamite?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Either that, or we’re looking at a major
factory recall.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Dead guys… don’t make bad jokes, right?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So we’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah. Hooray.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Go. Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Get the fuck out of here, I’ll take the
heat on this one. Rent a car. Then go home and wait for my call. Do
it.</p>
<p><strong>int. l.a.p.d. robbery/homicide division - night</strong>:
Sergeant Benjamin Bessalo is in the mood to kick things. A metal
trashcan is booted across the room with a clang as he whirls, glaring at
Joe Hallenbeck, who is seated before him.</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: Goddammit, this is a police matter, you son
of a bitch! I’m sick and fucking tired of sweeping up your dead bodies,
Joe, and the next time I see your ugly mug I’m puttin’ a bullet in it.
You got that? You are off the case, buddy. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: If you thought there was dynamite in the
trunk, wait’ll you see this.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The guy on the left is Connie Marcon, the
owner of the L.A. Stallions.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Forget about him. Look at the guy on the
right.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sort of familiar. Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Senator Calvin Baynard.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Let’s go back to the cops. I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Take it easy, kid. It’s not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Not so bad. Excuse me, did you just say the
words not so bad? You don’t understand, Joe, see, if a guy vomits on the
sidewalk, you don’t say, ‘Oh, hey, it’s not so bad, there’s some ham in
there.’ It’s fucking vomit, okay? This is bad.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: When I was thirty, I was on the
President’s personal security force. Once night I was on the way home
from a late session. I’m on the highway just outside of Georgetown when
I see something up ahead.</p>
<p><strong>memory flash</strong>: Another time. Another night. A
younger-looking Hallenbeck. Rugged features. Clipped military haircut.
He is driving. Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist. Up
ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog:</p>
<p><strong>wrecked car</strong>: is lying upside down in a pool of
shattered glass. He SCREECHES to a stop.</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: In a dream-like SLOW MOTION, he
approaches the overturned car. There are two dead bodies inside. A
woman. A little boy. In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with
suction cups to the remaining glass. The furry cat is splattered with
blood.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: It was a high-speed collision. Both cars
were totaled. The woman and the boy were dead. The driver of the other
car wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>staggering drunk</strong>: is weaving toward Hallenbeck.
Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes. He wears an $800 suit. Tan
Cordovan loafers. Silk tie.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Fuckin’ bitch… She got in front of me, man.
Shit. My fuckin’ car. Stupid bitch wrecked my car…</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Do you know who I am…? I’m Louis Baynard, my
father is Calvin D. Baynard, man. Call my father, he’ll take care of
it.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: You’ll tell ‘em what happened, right…? Bitch
swerved in front of me, man. Wrecked my fuckin’ Mercedes. Right…?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I could smell bourbon on him, big time.
He was standing there, not a scratch on him. I went a little nuts. I hit
him.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The blow was non-lethal. But when he
fell, his head hit the pavement funny. Put him in a coma.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: The younger Hallenbeck stands on the
highway of eight years past, staring at the Drunk with fierce, blazing
eyes as we –</p>
<p><strong>jimmy and joe - back to present</strong>: Driving.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Even when he came out of it, he was
never right in the head. His dad fixed everything with the cops. The
accident report disappeared. A week later the police found half a kilo
of crack cocaine planted in my house. Acting on an anonymous tip.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The senator fucked your job.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: And my pension. And my marriage. Only
reason I’m still licensed to carry a gun, the man himself made a few
calls. Since then I’m just playing it out. Day by day.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Cory tumbled to some sort of deal between
Marcon and the senator, and they had her killed. We gotta show this
photo to the cops.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Not yet. I need more evidence. I want
Baynard, Jimmy. I want to bring him down. I could use your help.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why should I help you?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Because if Baynard takes a fall, so does
Marcon. The man who kicked you out of professional football.</p>
<p><strong>int. plush bedroom - night</strong>: A tall, thin, almost
effeminate MAN is seated on a couch. High cheekbones. A shock of blond
hair. Glittering, malignant eyes. He is directing a pornographic
film.</p>
<p><strong>pretty girl</strong>: is bound hand and foot to the posts of
a lavishly appointed bed. Around her, the room is filled with Kleig
lights. Reflectors. Camera equipment. The girl is scowling furiously.
She speaks to the director:</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I want the sheets changed, Milo.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Of course you do, but we’re running behind,
dearest.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I don’t give a shit. I’m an actress, not a
piece of meat, and I want clean sheets!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Fine. It’s done. Right after this next
shot.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Okay, let’s do it. Roll camera.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Rolling.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: And… action!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Milo… What the fuck is this, some kind of
joke?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Not at all, dearest. It’s what’s known as a
snuff film.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Oh God Milo please oh God oh no please
Miloooo!!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Easy, Pablo. She’s not a piece of meat.</p>
<p><strong>int. wood-paneled study - continuous action</strong>: Milo
enters, all business. Crosses to a telephone with a blinking light.
Stabs a button. Scoops up the receiver.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yes, Mr. Marcon? How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Is this line secure?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: One hundred percent, sir. I wouldn’t have used
your name otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Sid and Jake are dead, Milo. Killed in an
explosion. Looks like we got a new player in the game.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Who is he working for?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: From available information, he appears to be
a free agent. Guy by the name of Joe Hallenbeck.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Get me everything you can on this fucker,
Milo. I want it on my computer screen in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yes, sir. And then?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: And then you’ll be handling it
personally.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So I get to meet your family, huh? What’s
your daughter like?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: She’s like thirteen. And if you even
look at her funny, I’ll shove an umbrella up your ass and open it.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallenbeck house - continuous action</strong>: As they
come through the front door, Joe’s daughter, DARIAN, is slumped in a big
Lazy-Boy, staring sullenly at a movie on TV. Cute kid, cursed to wear
ridiculous- looking dental headgear.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: First things first. I’m starving. Hey,
kiddo. Why aren’t you in bed?</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: I’m watching television.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I can see that.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: I hate you. Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She still won’t look at him. The two men
cross to the kitchen. Hallenbeck opens the refrigerator, takes out some
lunchmeat.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: She’s pissed off because I wouldn’t let
her go out on a date with her friend Billy.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: I missed the biggest party of the year.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why couldn’t she go?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Because she’s thirteen, that’s why. I
bought you some ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: I’m not talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Gee, that’s a shame. You always have
such pleasant things to say. ‘I hate you, Dad.’ I’m gonna miss that,
darn it… It’s chocolate chip, your favorite.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: I don’t care. You’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: That’s for saying asshole. God, I hate
wasting food. Wanna abuse me some more? Go ahead, shock me. You know, I
hardly ever hear the word asshole.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Bullshit, I bet you get it all the time.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: All right, knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: What’re you gonna do, ground me some
more?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hey, you want it, you got it, lady.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Thank you, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You’re grounded for a week.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Yes, sir, asshole.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: That’s two. You wanna play this game? I
love this game.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Just leave me alone. He thinks he’s fuckin’
Ward Cleaver.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: All right, that’s it. You wanna be a
gutter mouth? You wanna sound like your mother, well that’s terrific.
Christ, all day long I don’t take enough abuse, I gotta listen to shit
from you!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey, Joe, take it easy…</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Don’t you tell me how to talk to my
kid.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: All I wanted was to go to a party, but Pop
here thinks I’m out to get laid.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Go for it, kiddo. All the dirty words.
Come on, shock me. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Sure thing, you dumb fuck-up.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: All right, I’ve had it. Go to your room.
Or I will whip your behind.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: You’d probably like it.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Goddammit, you are my daughter and you
will respect me, got that? You got it? You don’t ever call me a
fuck-up.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Why shouldn’t I, Mom calls you that all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Your mother called me a fuck-up…?
When?</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: On the phone to Uncle Jay.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Uncle Jay? Ohh, Christ, I’m a fuck-up,
but Uncle Jay, now there’s a real stand-up guy. Shit, the bastard cheats
on his tax form, I’m surprised he hasn’t done time! Why don’t you ask
your mother why Mister Wonderful isn’t in jail for tax evasion?</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Because he doesn’t fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy
to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: No. Anything that much fun, I’d want to
do myself.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think we could both use a drink.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s you?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah. That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You look like the dad on ‘The Brady
Bunch.’</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah, I was a regular Boy Scout.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So. You gonna get a divorce?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You don’t like women much, do you, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Mike Miller wasn’t the first time. Sarah
has cheated on me before. Twice. I never told her I knew. At first, my
opinion of women took a real dip, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And now?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Now I’m content if I like the guy she’s
fucking. This last one was my best friend.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Horseshit, he was a scumbag private eye.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: What am I, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He tried to get you killed.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Friends can’t be perfect. I wish the sky
wasn’t blue. I wish water wasn’t wet. I wish I didn’t still love my
wife.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You know what I did last night?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I went to a party and shit on a car.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Damn. You, too?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m a complete loser. Capital ‘L.’ All I ever
wanted… was to be somebody’s hero, you know it…? Now I mostly sit
around. Watch T.V. Get laid. I’m a fucking slug, throw salt on me I’d
curl up. Life sucks.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Life doesn’t suck?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: No, life sucks. But you’re not a loser.
Cory loved you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah, and the last thing I did was cheat on
her. Why do people cheat, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Because it’s easier than paying the tax,
Junior.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Ooooooh. Very deep.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: So deep I don’t know what the fuck it
means.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It means another drink is required.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Alex the accountant.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Is Alex your accountant?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No. But he could have been. Alex was my
son.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I was married at 19. Sweet young thing,
looking to get out from under daddy’s thumb. I didn’t know she was a
junkie. All during her pregnancy. Shooting up. There were complications.
She died. Alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator. Fell
asleep. Died before he woke up. He was born… He had time for one dream…
and then he died. I wonder what his dream was about.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I think about him a lot. I mean, who was
this… guy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: This little guy who only got seventeen
minutes, who was he, Joe…? What was he like? What would he have
been?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: He would have been a great ball player.
Like his dad.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No. He had to die, Joe. Don’t you see?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Why did he have to die?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Because he came out of me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m gonna borrow your shower.</p>
<p><strong>int. bathroom - continuous action</strong>: Jimmy enters and
shuts the door. Turns on the shower. Makes no move to undress. Instead,
he reaches inside the waistband on his pants. Removes a vial of coke.
Dips a spoon. The door opens. Hallenbeck is standing there with a
handful of fresh towels. He stops. Staring at Jimmy. They freeze in
tableau. Then Hallenbeck crosses the floor with two quick strides and
slugs Jimmy with all his might. Decks him. The kid goes over backward
into the shower, head striking the porcelain. He swerves. Claws his way
out, drenched.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Not in my house, you dumb
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Joe, man, you don’t get it –</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: This is what you went looking for in
Cory’s apartment, isn’t it? You found this when you found that
envelope.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Joe, please!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You stupid bastard, do you know what you’ve
done? That was a thousand bucks’ worth of shit!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You got it, son. I’m just mixing it in
with all the other shit. Get the fuck out of my house. Now.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I said, get out. I’ll break your fucking
neck, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Go ahead, tough guy. Go ahead. I’m trying to
survive, man. I use that stuff to get by, so fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I don’t use it. I get by.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right, you stand
there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on
you, did you, pal?? And your fucking kid?? And I said to God, ‘Hey,
buddy, what gives? I go to church, I give to the United Way, what is
this dead wife and kid shit…?’ And he didn’t say nothin’, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And then I lose my job, my fucking life,
okay, and why…? You know why? Because I gambled. Whoa, hold on, stop the
presses, Jimmy gambled, well shit, of course I gambled, everybody does,
and the fucking league knows it!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Why, Joe? Why is there an injury report in
pro football, huh…? Nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the
N.F.L. does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread! Marcon… the
commissioner … those fucking hypocrites… killed the last thing I could
do, Joe…! I can’t do anything… anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I couldn’t save my wife… She died screaming
and I couldn’t do a Goddamn thing… And my baby came out… and he was so
fuckin’ small, Joe… He was too fuckin’ small…</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: When you’re through feeling sorry for
yourself, the front door’s that way.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: You’re a total bastard.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You brought cocaine in my house. End of
story.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: You’re Jimmy Dix, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: I’m sorry I acted like a bitch. Would you
sign my card?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I told you to go to your room.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: But, Dad – !</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Go to bed. This guy’s not signing
anything.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Aw, come off it.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Forget it, Darian. The guy’s a loser.
Big time.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jimmy walks past her to the front door.
Stops with his hand on the knob. Turns.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I never shaved points, Joe. I never did.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: If you want my help, I’m at the Casa Loma
Apartments on Ventura.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Smile, you fuck.</p>
<p><strong>int. master bedroom - dawn</strong>: The first light of day
streams through the window. Hallenbeck pushes Furry Tom to one side.
Sits on the bed. Regards his sleeping wife with hooded, lifeless eyes.
She is peaceful. Serene. He reaches out to touch her. Stops. Withdraws
his hand. Crushes out the cigarette. Stands. Leaves.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Billy…</p>
<p><strong>another angle - front door</strong>: Down the hall to the
front door. Flings it open, pissed off.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Goddammit, Jimmy, I told you – !</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Good morning, Joseph.</p>
<p><strong>int. cluttered apartment - morning</strong>: Jimmy looks bad.
Sprawled out on a tangle of dirty sheets. Jeans. Bare feet. Smoking.
Staring at a football card. A duplicate of the one Darian showed him. He
swings his legs off the bed. Stands, crushes out his cigarette. Moves
into the bathroom. The Baggie of coke is on the counter. He stares at it
with bloodshot eyes. Swallows hard. Acts before he can think. Grabs the
Baggie. Tosses it in the toilet. Flushes. Watches as it goes down the
drain.</p>
<p><strong>ext. casa loma apartments - morning</strong>: Another
Goddamned day. A chill drizzle. The palm trees look forlorn.</p>
<p><strong>at corner newsstand</strong>: Jimmy buys a paper. Trudges
along Ventura Boulevard. Huddled against the chill.</p>
<p><strong>sleek, black sedan</strong>: slides to the curb in front of
him. Two men get out: One is Pablo, who last we saw wielding a chainsaw
in Milo’s snuff film; the other is an ugly piece of hired muscle who
we’ll call CHET. The two men flank Jimmy and walk alongside him. He
looks up, startled.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Good morning, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who are you, and how the fuck do you know my
name?</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: This is the guy? You sure it’s the guy?</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: This is him.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: The kid with the million-dollar arm?</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Shit. He don’t look like much. I wouldn’t pay
no million dollars for this bozo.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Neither will anyone else, anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m growing whiskers here, guys. You got
something to say, fucking say it.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Wow. Tough guy stuff. Must have caught it from
his buddy Hallenbeck.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Don’t play dumb, shithead. You were with him
last night at the club.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson,
Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking
business.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Get ready, kid. This one’s an E ticket.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Please, guys, don’t do this… Jesus Christ, I
was just her boyfriend, I swear to God, please!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Not a terrible fate, under normal
circumstances. In this case, however – A fifty-foot drop…</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: His million-dollar arm. His throwing
arm. He clutches at cracked ribs, screaming:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm, oh Jesus
Christ!!!</p>
<p><strong>long shot - jimmy</strong>: Alone in the pit. Huddled in a
pool of muddy water. His screams of pain ECHO in the chill, morning
air.</p>
<p><strong>int. lapd robbery/homicide division - day</strong>: Ben
Bessalo’s office, to be precise. Bessalo reclines grumpily at his desk.
Scanning reports. McCaskey hangs up the phone and calls across the
room:</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: Gimmee the bad news first. Bad news is,
they just pulled Jimmy Dix out of a construction site on Ventura. He’s
busted up.</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: Okay, now gimme the bad news. I just got a
call from Hallenbeck’s neighbor. Now, according to Hallenbeck, Mike
Miller came to the house early that morning to talk about a case,
right?</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: McCASKEY</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: He lied. Why did he lie…?</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: Shit. Miller was fucking his wife.
What?</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: That’s why the car was there, Miller was
fucking Hallenbeck’s wife, Hallenbeck just got back from out of town,
remember? Christ, Joe wasted the bastard himself!</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: I want an A.P.B. out on Joe Hallenbeck.
Now. Find him and if he resists arrest, shoot the bastard.</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: I let him go, Mick. He wasted Mike Miller
and waltzed right out of my office, I let him go, Goddammit! Relax, Ben.
We’ll bring him in. He’s not that good.</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: You wanna bet?</p>
<p><strong>joe hallenbeck’s unconscious face</strong>: Weathered.
Sallow. Dark circles under the eyes.</p>
<p><strong>hand</strong>: comes INTO FRAME and slaps him. Hard. Rocks
his head to one side.</p>
<p><strong>int. elegant beach house - living room - another
angle</strong>: Thick carpet. Polished, wood furniture. Window walls.
Outside, the sea is angry and grey.</p>
<p><strong>pablo and chet</strong>: are standing over Hallenbeck, who is
slumped in a chair. Both hitmen wear holstered sidearms. Chet leans over
and slaps Hallenbeck again. The big detective begins to stir. His
eyelids flutter.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: I think he’s awake.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Make sure.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m awake.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: You nearly broke my wrist, man.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Life’s a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He starts pawing his coat pockets,
looking for a cigarette. In the corner, Pablo chuckles:</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Milo warned us to watch out for this guy.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Fuck that. Look at him. He’s nothin’. Guy’s a
piece of shit.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Anybody got a cigarette…?</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Sure, buddy. I got a cigarette.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Hey, baby, I thought you were tough. See,
Pablo, he ain’t so bad.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I seem to have dropped my cigarette. May
I have another?</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Sure. Sure thing, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He hands Hallenbeck another smoke.
Hallenbeck puts it between his lips.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I need a light. And if you touch me
again… I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>chet</strong>: Baby! Two for two!</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Jesus Christ. You son-of-a-bitch. Jesus
Christ!!</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: You killed him! ‘Fuckin’ A, you killed him,
he’s fuckin’ dead!!!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: At that moment, a door opens, and Milo
enters. Slick. Well-dressed. Utterly composed.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Is there a problem?</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: He killed Chet, Milo. The mother- fucker just
killed him!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Oh, my. Oh, Goddamn. Joseph, Joseph, you don’t
disappoint me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You seem to have killed one of my men.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I needed a light.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You took an awful risk. Pablo here could have
shot you dead.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: If you wanted me dead, you’d have
already killed me.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yes, that’s true. I suppose introductions are
in order.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Fuck it. You’re the bad guy, right?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Yes. I’m the bad guy.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: And you’ve got the gun, and I’m supposed
to tremble in fear, something like that?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Fine. I’ll start trembling in a minute.
Mind if I have a drink first?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I don’t see why not. Pablo, please take Chet’s
corpse into the other room, and then fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Make that two.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hey, look who’s here. Connie Marcon
himself.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Careful, son. Only my friends call me
Connie.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You got friends? When did this
happen?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: I’ll give you one thing. You’re pretty calm
for a man in your position.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You’re pretty calm for a man whose team
is three and six on the year.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: They’re having some problems.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: They stink.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: I’m glad you’re here, Joe. We got a few
things to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: For starters, I’m sure you’re aware that
professional football is changing, and not for better. Used to be, you
went to the local stadium come Sunday, you saw heroes. Guys who fought
for their hometown. Anymore, no one gives a shit. Ever since Sonny
Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe Namath back in ’66, the sons of bitches
just got greedier. Playing only for themselves. Giving nothing back to
the game.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: This year, the final blow: the N.F.L. votes
to decertify the Players Organization. Eliminates the draft, reduces all
athletes to free agents. Reduces football, once and for all, to
commerce. To greed, you follow?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: When do I say the Pledge of
Allegiance?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Do you know how many ratings points Monday
Night Football lost this year? Per week? An average of two point
eight.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Oh, for Chrissake. You’re telling me
this whole thing is about TV ratings?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: People have stopped watching, Joe!
Everybody’s turning the channel, they’re still looking for heroes, you
follow? Guys like you. Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the
President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We took the liberty of researching your
background.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: How about it, Joe? Is it truth or hype?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I got the rifle in my closet as a
souvenir.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: There you go, that’s what I’m saying. The
public wants real heroes. Not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping
from team to team with their fancy lawyers. In fact, Joe, and this is my
point, there’s only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football. Can
you guess?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Gambling.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Exactly. Gambling. Just one problem:
football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states. And
that, Joe boy, is where I come in.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Shit, that’s what this is about! You’re
bribing United States senators. Paying them to pass legislation –</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: – Legalizing football gambling in all fifty
states. Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Attendance goes up again. TV ratings go
up again.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: You got it, son. The networks are happy. I’m
happy. Everybody’s happy.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Before we get too fucking happy, let’s
get a couple things straight: first, I’m not your fucking son, and
second… why am I still alive?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: It’s like this, Joe: everything was going
great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin
Baynard.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I don’t get it. What’s the snag?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: I offered him the bribe and he wouldn’t take
it.</p>
<p><strong>hallebeck</strong>: Baynard? Are you nuts? The guy’s so
crooked he shits slinkies.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Allow me to clarify: I offered him the
bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Thank God. For a minute there I felt
hell freezing over. Did he ask for more than a million?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Does the Pope shit in the woods? He wants
two million or he’ll blow the lid off my whole plan. I don’t feel like
paying no two mil, so basically that good ole’ boy’s gotta die.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Taking off a U.S. senator, that’s pretty
ballsy. Even for an asshole like you.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Oh, I’m not going to kill Baynard, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Who is?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m the perfect fall guy. Everyone and
his uncle Max knows I hate Baynard.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on
you, Joe boy. My hands are clean.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Any particular reason I should go along
with this prize-winning scheme?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Just one.</p>
<p><strong>angle on hallenbeck</strong>: He stands. Face contorting.
Fists clenched. Rage courses through him like an electric current.
Marcon cocks his gun.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Sit down, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Do what he says, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Are you alright, Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s a temporary condition, Joseph. As you
may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave
snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you…
your wife will make her motion picture debut.</p>
<p><strong>int. hospital emergency room - day</strong>: Meanwhile, back
at the ranch, Jimmy is seated, shirtless, on a metal examining table.
His ribs are taped. His arm in a cast. Two men loom over him, sour
expressions on their faces: Sergeants McCaskey and Bessalo. Jimmy shakes
his head, exasperated:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Look, I’ll say it again for the cheap seats:
I don’t know anything and I can’t help you. Okay? Can I go now?</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: Let me get this straight: you’re walking
along, minding your own business, when two guys you never met jump you
and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: You’re full of shit, kid. Tell me where
Hallenbeck is.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: How the fuck should I know? Try his
house.</p>
<p><strong>bessalo</strong>: We did. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: For Chrissake, I just met the guy. Look,
Sergeant. I don’t give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just busted my
throwing arm and I’m in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices:
either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here.</p>
<p><strong>ext. casa loma apartments - day</strong>: The grey day wears
on. Jimmy trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment unit. Pulls
up short, staring ahead –</p>
<p><strong>darian hallenbeck</strong>: Slumped outside the door to his
apartment. Asleep. A crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand. He
kneels beside her. Touches her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey. Wake up.</p>
<p><strong>call the police and we’ll kill them both.</strong>: He stares
at the note, dumbstruck.</p>
<p><strong>ext. beach house - day</strong>: A savage wind sweeps in off
the ocean. Gulls wheel overhead.</p>
<p><strong>forty foot yacht</strong>: is tethered to a wooden dock
outside the beach house. Milo and his crew prepare to cast off.
Meanwhile:</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: approaches along the dock, looking lean and
mean in an Izod shirt. He stops in front of Sarah and Joe
Hallenbeck.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: They are seated on the dock. Each
handcuffed to a metal railing. Pablo kneels and unfastens Joe’s
cuffs.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Get up.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Go fuck yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I meant that… in a good way…</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Time for a little payback, Joe. Call it a
service to dear departed Chet.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: How’s that feel, fuckhead?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m asshole… she’s fuckhead.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Easy, Pablo. I want him conscious.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Goddamn you, stop it!! Oh, Jesus, leave him
alone!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Pablo gives Joe a last swift kick. Spits
on him. Hallenbeck vomits. Lies bleeding on the dock. Sarah crawls over
to him. As far as the cuffs will allow. Cradles his head in her lap.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Don’t… look at me…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Shhh. It’s okay, Joe. I’m here, it’s okay. I
love you, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I get the shit beat out of me… puke all
over myself… and now you love me?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I never stopped loving you, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Christ, you slept with three guys.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You knew about the others?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I knew.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You never said anything.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Figured… you needed them.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Joe, Goddammit, why didn’t you say
something?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Like what? ‘Fuck you, Sarah’?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything to show that
you… that you had some pride left.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Sorry… I’m fresh out.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m scared, Joe. Get me out of this.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Must be my trick ear. Sounded like you
said, ‘Get me out of this.’</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You can take these guys, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’ve got cracked ribs and a
concussion.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Save me, Joe. Be a hero.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I don’t believe in heroes.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Fuck you, Sarah…</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: All right, lovebirds, break it up.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Nice tits.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Stay down, fucker. Don’t you move.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Careful, Pablo. We don’t want to get
Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time to go, and
remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You’re gonna kill us both anyway.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Perhaps. But there are ways to die, and then
there are… ways to die. Capisce? You determine your wife’s fate.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Joe…!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’ll be back. That’s a promise.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’re wasting my time, Joseph. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: If you touch me again… I’ll kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>int. topanga canyon home - day</strong>: Remember Jimmy’s
friend, Henry, who we met briefly near the opening of the film? Of
course you do, you’re a highly-paid reader or development person. Well,
Henry is seated in a big, lived-in den watching football films. The
walls around him are adorned with hunting paraphernalia. Rifles.
Trophies. There is a KNOCK at the door. He gets up. Crosses to the door.
Opens it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I need to borrow a gun, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>int. expensive, wood-paneled office - afternoon</strong>:
Conrad Marcon sits behind a huge teak desk. Surrounded by football
paraphernalia. Paintings. Trophies. The PHONE CHIRPS. He picks up the
receiver. Stabs a button.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Marcon.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It’s Milo, sir. We’re now underway and should
be lying off Catalina within two hours.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Good boy, Milo. The commissioner’s party
starts at six. I’ll put in a token appearance around six-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Any problems with Hallenbeck?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No, we’re getting along famously.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Glad to hear it. No fuckups, Milo. I want
him deep-sixed.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I assure you, neither he nor the senator will
see another sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Christ, Milo, how come you always have to
talk like a fruit?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: If it annoys you, I could always adopt a Texas
drawl, though I’m afraid I don’t know any stories about fucking pigs.
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Cows, Milo. Never pigs.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’ll remember that, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Goddamn fruitcake.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: So far, so good.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: We’ve worked too hard, Con. There’s no
margin for error.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Take it easy, buddy. We’re covered.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: You’re using the first team, yes?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Absolutely. Actually, I have no choice.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Fuckin’ Hallenbeck killed the second and
third teams.</p>
<p><strong>ext. long beach boat yard - afternoon</strong>: A sign reads,
BOAT RENTALS: DAY AND WEEK. Jimmy moves briskly down a concrete ramp
toward a Hatteras sport charter. He is obsessed. Determined. Darian
trots along behind him. She’s holding up pretty well, considering.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: What do you need a boat for?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m gonna crash a party out on Catalina.
Marcon will be there.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Maybe… we should call the police.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: No, honey. Not now. There’s some big shots
involved in this mess, and it’s my word against theirs. If I blab to the
cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they’ll never find the bodies.
I’m sorry, Darian.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: So… what do we do…?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What I do… is confront Conrad Marcon and
threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Is that gonna work?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Beats me, but I think it’s what your dad
would do.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Me, too, honey.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: So… why’d you come to me, anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: I don’t know. I thought you’d… know what
happened, know what to do… I mean, you were one of my dad’s big
heroes.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: When I was little, he used to talk about you
all the time. Best football player in the game. Great this. Wonderful
that. You shoulda seen him when you got busted.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’ll get them back, kiddo. I’ll get them
back.</p>
<p><strong>ext. catalina island - establishing shot - night</strong>:
The island sits beneath a dark, cloud-filled sky. Fog nestles in the
foothills, rolling in off the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>catalina ferry</strong>: slices through the murk, filled with
light, laughter,</p>
<p><strong>on shore</strong>: Boats are arriving at a private dock. A
steady stream of guests. Tuxedoes and evening gowns. A parade of phony
hair and phony boobs.</p>
<p><strong>int. opulent living room - party</strong>: in progress.
People with six-figure incomes. Pretending they’re important. Mingling.
Schmoozing. At a raised bar, Conrad Marcon bends the ear of a Japanese
businessman. A lot of laughter. Back-slapping. A sudden commotion near
the front door. FLASHBULBS POP. People crane their necks. Marcon turns
to look, as:</p>
<p><strong>senator calvin baynard</strong>: enters the party, surrounded
by an entourage of men in Armani suits. Seeing this, Marcon’s face
changes. Gone is the affable Texan. In his place, a ruthless murderer.
He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>automatic rifle</strong>: as a thirty-shot clip is snapped
into place.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Your wife’s very pretty.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Fuck you, cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: My, my. Little testy this evening.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: That’s not very polite, you know, calling
someone a cocksucker. A lot of hard Ks. Very abusive sounding.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What would you do, Joseph, if someone called
you that? Would you cut out one of his eyes…?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: What would you do?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’d go off and suck some cock and leave
him the fuck alone.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: It occurs to me, Joseph, that I would very
much like to hear you scream.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Come again?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’re so cool, aren’t you? So… if you’ll
pardon the expression… hard-boiled. I’d like, just once, to hear you
scream in pain.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Play some rap music.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: When do I kill Baynard?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Come now, Joseph, did you really think that
I’d hand you a loaded gun? You’re not really going to kill anyone.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m not?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You’re going to be framed for the senator’s
murder… when they find your corpse at the scene of the crime.</p>
<p><strong>ext. private dock - night</strong>: Boats, lots of them.
Sportfishers. Yachts. Floating boats. Money, money, everywhere, and
plenty of drinks to drop.</p>
<p><strong>hatteras sport boat</strong>: PURRS quietly into the harbor.
Jimmy at the rudder. Nudges up to the dock. In the chalet above, the
party rages.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay, hot shit, let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>ext. deck - night</strong>: Jimmy emerges from the cabin.
Heads for the rail. A voice calls out:</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Nice tux.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Goddammit, I told you to go home!</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Fuck you, I stowed away. They’re my parents,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fine, whatever. Just stay here. With the
boat.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Darian starts to protest. He throws her
the keys.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Anything funny happens, get the fuck out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: You look terrible.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I feel terrible.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Are you really a drug addict?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I was. I kicked the habit.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: This morning. Stay here.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Don’t let them break your other arm.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Thanks, kid. You’re a fuckin’
inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>int. milo’s yacht - cabin - same time</strong>: Milo speaks
to Hallenbeck. Clipped. Businesslike.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard will leave
the party, hopefully unobserved. He and his entourage will board a fast
boat, and rendezvous with us at sea.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Jesus. He thinks he’s geting his
two-million-dollar payoff.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Baynard will not leave his boat. One of his
men will board us, and inspect the contents of the suitcase. This
suitcast.</p>
<p><strong>hundred dollar bills</strong>: Twenty thousand of them, to be
precise. Neatly bundled.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Then we pull a simple switch. When the man
returns to his boat, he’s carrying this suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Plastics?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Detonation upon opening. Enough to kill the
passengers, not enough to sink the craft. And when we place your charred
corpse amidst the wreckage, the police will draw the inevitable
conclusion: a down-on-his-luck P.I. makes a suicide strike against the
man who cost a career.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: That sounds lovely, but how is my body
gonna get charred?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Maybe I’ll get to hear you scream, after
all…</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: You better get up here, we got a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>ext. yacht - on deck - night</strong>: Milo’s yacht is
anchored about a half mile offshore. Island lights blink in the
distance. Fog rolls in. Milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck.
Crosses to the railing, looks down at:</p>
<p><strong>fishing boat</strong>: bobbing in the water about thirty
yards away. A FISHERMAN is waving his arms. Hailing them. Beside him,
his wife and seventeen-year-old son.</p>
<p><strong>fisherman</strong>: Hey! Buddy, I got a cracked engine
casing, I’m dead in the water! Can I get a tow?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. This boat is Island Security,
we’re under strict orders to stay within this sector.</p>
<p><strong>fisherman</strong>: Aw, shit! Look, it’ll take ten
minutes!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: I’m sorry, we can’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>fisherman</strong>: Goddammit, now I gotta call the Coast
Guard!</p>
<p><strong>crew member</strong>: Milo, he’s gonna bring the Coast Guard
down on top of us.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Excuse me. Sir?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Fuck you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He reaches under his Windbreaker. Pulls
out an Ingram model MACHINE GUN.</p>
<p><strong>opens fire.</strong>: The entire family is blown away. WOOD
SPLINGERS POP and fly.</p>
<p><strong>glass shatters.</strong>: The bodies topple like broken toys.
Milo ceases fire. Turns to his crewman.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Problem solved. Get over there and put the
bodies below where they can’t be seen.</p>
<p><strong>ext. party house - night</strong>: Jimmy is strolling along a
hedge behind the house. Looking for a back entrance. He hears VOICES,
approaching. Pulls up short. Ducks into the shadows. Senator Baynard
goes by, with two bodyguards. Brisk. Businesslike.</p>
<p><strong>senator</strong>: Christ, I can’t believe I agreed to this
dog and pony show. Let’s get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>int./ext. jimmy’s boat - night</strong>: Jimmy casts off the
lines. Heads for the cockpit. Darian is inside.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Gimmee the keys, kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The Senator’s here, and he’s leaving by the
back door. I’m gonna follow him.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Get off the boat.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Fuck you, man. No way.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Darian, Goddammit –</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: I’m not coming out!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Okay. Shit. Okay. Easy. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>int. cockpit - same</strong>: The PILOT works the stick while
the CO-PILOT searches the water below through infra-red binoculars. He
speaks into a microphone.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: This is Air One, over.</p>
<p><strong>male</strong>: Roger, Air One, over.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: The drop zone is clear, repeat, the drop
zone is clear, over.</p>
<p><strong>milo’s yacht - same time</strong>: Milo is at the other end
of the connection. Beside him, two crewmen.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Roger, Air One, over and out. Up anchor,
gentlemen, we have a go. Gag him and stash him.</p>
<p><strong>ext. pacific ocean - night</strong>: About two miles
offshore. The Senator’s Marlineer cuts through the waves, converging
with Milo’s yacht. The two boats pull up alongside. The lines are made
fast. One of Milo’s crewmen greets Senator Baynard’s AIDE, a
slick-looking Italian in a $1,000 overcoat.</p>
<p><strong>ext. offshore waters - in fogbank</strong>: Jimmy Dix is
clearly lost. He bangs his fist in frustration.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Goddammit, I lost him. I can’t see a fucking
thing.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: See if this boat has sonar.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Watch your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Take a bath in my ass.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Okay. We’re cool.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hey! Any of you stupid fucks bother to frisk
this goombah?</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: No, sir, we didn’t think –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Exactly, you didn’t think! Goddammit, that’s
two million bucks there, now frisk the fuckin’ guy!</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Hey, baby, I’m clean, take it easy –</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Fuck easy. Against the wall, spread ’em!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: As Baynard’s man assumes the position –
Milo hits a concealed button. It happen in less than a second: the
built-in counter rotates into the wall, only to be replaced by an
indentical counter. Identical half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Identical
coffee cup. And, of course, the identical suitcase. The indignant Aide
turns around, pat-down concluded.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Okay? Satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: We’re cool, baby.</p>
<p><strong>back topside</strong>: Baynard’s man emerges onto the deck,
carrying the suitcase. Steps over the rail, crossing to the Senator’s
boat. Gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there. They cast off the
lines. Freeing the two boats.</p>
<p><strong>int. milo’s yacht - bridge</strong>: Milo watches, tense. As
the lines are freed, he says:</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Hard to starboard, get us out of here. Back
off a hundred yards and wait for the blast.</p>
<p><strong>int. senator’s cabin - same time</strong>: The go-between
heads below deck, carrying the suitcase. Senator Baynard puts down his
wine glass. Looks up, expectant. The Aide flashes an “A-Okay” grin. Sets
the suitcase on a table. Meanwhile –</p>
<p><strong>int. jimmy’s sport boat - bridge</strong>: Jimmy has had
about enough. He sighs with frustration. Stares ahead into the fog.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: All we’re doing is burning gas. Sorry, kid,
I’m turning back.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Do you hear that – ?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Holy fucking shit!</p>
<p><strong>int. air one - cockpit</strong>: The PILOT grabs the mike and
shouts into it:</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Code yellow, code yellow, we got a bogie,
repeat, we got a bogie, over.</p>
<p><strong>int. milo’s yacht - bridge</strong>: Milo snaps his head to
one side, hearing this. Grabs the mike:</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Air One, Air One, where the fuck is he?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Nine o’clock, repeat, on your nine, and
closing fast!</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Jimmy’s BOAT ROARS out of the fog…
And suddenly he’s in a world of shit. Less than fifty yards to port is
Milo’s yacht. Fifty years to starboard is the Senator’s Marlineer.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, wow. We’re fucked.</p>
<p><strong>air one</strong>: screams past, cutting across the bow,
nearly taking off the roof – Jimmy, wrestling the wheel, and meanwhile
–</p>
<p><strong>int. baynard’s cabin</strong>: The Senator actually has his
hands on the suitcase to open it, when one of his MEN yells:</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Shit! Something’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>baynard</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Another boat. It’s a fucking setup!</p>
<p><strong>baynard</strong>: Get us out of here, now!</p>
<p><strong>ext. high seas</strong>: Baynard’s Marlineer surges forward.
Full throttle, heading for shore, as –</p>
<p><strong>ext. milo’s yacht</strong>: Milo skids out on deck, grabbing
for his machine gun. Calls out:</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Who the fuck is he?</p>
<p><strong>inside storage compartment</strong>: Hallenbeck has no
fucking idea what’s going on, but he can hear everthing that’s said,
as:</p>
<p><strong>back on deck</strong>: the Crewman lowers the binoculars in
disbelief:</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: Son of a bitch! It’s Dix, the Goddamn
quarterback!</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: There’s a little girl with him!</p>
<p><strong>back topside</strong>: Air One does a flyby, circling,
awaiting instructions.</p>
<p><strong>on deck</strong>: Milo grabs the hand mike and says:</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Air One, Air One, follow the Senator, roger?
I’ll take the sport boat, you take Baynard, over.</p>
<p><strong>air one</strong>: That’s a roger. Over and out.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Okay, let’s go. Full throttle.</p>
<p><strong>int. yacht - same time</strong>: With a final, resounding
crash, Hallenbeck kicks open the compartment. Topples out onto the cabin
floor.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Works his bound hands over his knees so
they’re now tied in front of him. Everybody’s topside; for the moment,
at least, he is forgotten. He half crawls, half lurches over to the
kitchen nook. Worms beneath the table… awkward, desperate… Drags out the
can of gasoline. Tries to unscrew the top. No dice. Can’t get a grip.
Finally, in frustration, he tips the can on its side. Brings his legs up
in the air – Slams them down on the can. Over and over until, with a
metallic pop – ! it bursts. Floods gasoline over the carpet,
meanwhile:</p>
<p><strong>back topside</strong>: Milo’s yacht is plowing ahead, gaining
on Jimmy’s Hatteras. The crew members take up positions on the prow.
OPEN FIRE.</p>
<p><strong>with jimmy</strong>: As he throws Darian to the deck, shields
her with his body. The wheelhouse is RAKED by GUNFIRE. He grits his
teeth. Reaches beneath his tux. Yanks out the BERETTA and returns FIRE,
BAM – BAM – ! and meanwhile:</p>
<p><strong>int. yacht cabin</strong>: Hallenbeck is opening a box of
kitchen matches with his teeth. Dozens of matches fall scattered on the
carpet. He releases the box. Bends. Picks up a single match in his
teeth. Presses his face to the wall. Gives his neck a wrench – Lights
the match. He drops the match on top of the GAS CAN.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: A WHOOSH of combustion. It bursts into
flame. Joe swivels around. Balancing on his backside. Thrusts his legs
into the fire. Strains. Pulls. Sweat runs in rivers. Until the ropes
binding his legs snap. He lurches to his feet, lets free. Now there’s
only one problem: He’s on fire. The legs of his pants are soaked with
gas. Flames race up his legs. He plunges headlong up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>on to deck</strong>: where he hurtles toward the rail, dives
– into the sea, swallowed by the waves. A CREWMAN suddenly screams:</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: Fire in the hole!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: surfaces, gasping for air. Trying to
swim with his hands tied.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: spots him first. Sees her father bobbing
like a cork in the ocean, screams:</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Daddy!!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shit. I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Do something! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Jimmy spins the wheel. Banks hard to
port. Brings the boat around in an arc. Yells to Darian:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Keep the wheel like this! Don’t let it
move!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Third and long, baby, lets’ go…</p>
<p><strong>ext. milo’s yacht</strong>: Milo, meanwhile, has also spotted
Hallenbeck. He growls in rage. Hefts the Ingram machine gun, as:</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his
bound hands around the passing anchor and whoosh – !</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Dad…!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: She collapses, weeping, atop her father.
Hugs him for all she’s worth.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: What the hell’s she doing here??</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: I stowed away…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy’s boat</strong>: Hallenbeck staggers to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Get below, Darian. And stay there.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Got any ideas?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Yeah. Go really fast and hope they don’t
catch us. Oh, shit.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: And then a shape materializes off to
port: Milo’s yacht. Running alongside. Drawing closer. Hallenbeck
wrestles the wheel. No dice. The yacht draws ever closer… men on deck…
machine guns… Joe looks over… and his face tells the story:</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: We’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What the fuck? They’re peeling off. Why?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: ’Cause they got sonar, that’s why! Hard
to port!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Port?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Left, Goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shit fuck piss!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We’re on half power, we lost an engine!</p>
<p><strong>ext. fog bank - same time</strong>: The crippled boat chugs
through the mist.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: swears again. Bangs his fist.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We’re sitting ducks. They got sonar. They can
find us.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Kill the running lights and radio the
Coast Guard.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy and joe</strong>: are still huddled on the floor.
Pause. They look up. Bewildered. There was a big light… Big noise… Why
aren’t they dead?</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: They move like sleepwalkers to the
cockpit window. Stare in disbelief. Joe looks at Jimmy. Jimmy at Joe.
Debris rains down.</p>
<p><strong>ext. crash site - minutes later</strong>: Jimmy, Joe and
Darian are on deck, chugging through the wreckage. Darian clings to her
father’s arm, in shock. Hallenbeck sees something in the distance.
Squints:</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: That’s Baynard’s boat!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: It can get us to shore faster than this
one, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hand me the pole.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Birthday present.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He turns away. Jimmy bends to open the
suitcase. Joe heads into the cockpit, Darian beside him. Steers the boat
away from the crash site. Toward the senator’s boat. Chugs forward on
half an engine. O.S., Jimmy suddenly yells:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Holy fucking shit!!</p>
<p><strong>ext. baynard’s boat - same time</strong>: The once-mighty
Marlineer runs aimless circles in the mist. Half the cockpit is blown
away, probably by a LAWS rocket. The Hatteras pulls up alongside, and
Hallenbeck steps to the rail, carrying the Baretta.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>int. senator’s boat - cockpit</strong>: Enters the cockpit.
What’s left of the roof is bullet- pocked. The navigator is dead.
Slumped over the controls. Joe pulls him off the panel. KILLS the
ENGINE.</p>
<p><strong>int. main cabin</strong>: Joe bursts inside. Hard and fast.
Gun leveled. No need. It’s a slaughterhouse. The walls are perforated.
Baynard and his men are dead. The suitcase’s evil twin lies unopened on
the table. Hallenbeck walks over to Baynard’s lifeless body. Stares into
the wide-open eyes.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Sorry, Cal. Life in the big city.</p>
<p><strong>ext. long beach boat rentals - night</strong>: The senator’s
boat pulls up to the dock. No one is around.</p>
<p><strong>ext. dock - same time</strong>: Hallenbeck crouches next to
Darian, looks her in the eye.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Listen carefully. I’m gonna go get your
mom back, okay? You’re gonna go in the Denny’s restaurant and stay
there. Talk to the waitress but don’t mention me. Mom and I will come
pick you up later, got it?</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: They’re gonna kill you…!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Are you kidding? I do this for a living.
Buy me an ice cream. I’ll be back. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>int. rental subaru - driving - night</strong>: All business
now. Deadly serious. Jimmy and Joe stare ahead through the windshield.
Grim. Tense. In the back seat sits the coveted suitcase.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Your prints are all over that boat. What
happens when they find the bodies inside?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Quit being a fuckin’ killjoy.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Come on. We’ve got some things to pick
up.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hallenbeck’s house - night</strong>: They creep across a
suburban lawn, hugging the shadows.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Across the street, Hallenbeck’s house is
dark. Deserted. Truly a sight: Jimmy, in a white shirt and tuxedo pants,
nursing a broken arm; and Joe, drenched to the skin, pants hanging in
scorched tatters. Joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand. They stop.
Crouched behind a eucalyptus tree. Joe points:</p>
<p><strong>their pov</strong>: A late-model Buick is parked just up the
street from his house… There is a man slouched inside. Smoking.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Shit. Someone’s staking me out.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, I forgot to tell you. The police want you
for killing Mike Miller.</p>
<p><strong>ext. coastal waters - night</strong>: A Coast Guard cutter is
circling the site of the boat/ chopper crash. A uniformed ENSIGN shines
a light on the dark waters.</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: I think I got someone! Four o’clock!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage.
Half his hair is burned away. His face is blistered. He looks up,
pleading, at the Ensign, as:</p>
<p><strong>another angle</strong>: He hides the Ingram beneath his body,
cocked and ready.</p>
<p><strong>int. parked buick - night</strong>: The sour stakeout cop
reaches for a job necessity: the pot to piss in. He undoes his fly. Pees
into an old Maxwell House coffee can. Opens the door to dump it out. A
hand reaches in, lightning quick. Grabs the can, throws it back in his
face. As he jerks backward, blinded, the hand knocks him cold.</p>
<p><strong>ext. buick - same time</strong>: Hallenbeck drags the
unconscious cop from the car.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Let’s get him inside and tie him up.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Are you crazy? That’s a cop! You don’t punch
cops!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I forgot. Hurry up.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallenbeck’s bedroom - minutes later</strong>: The cop
is bound and gagged in the corner. Unconscious. Hallenbeck moves
hurriedly. Not a second to waste. Pulls a dark turtleneck from a drawer.
Rips off the sleeve. Throws it to Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Wear that.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You know how to use a gun?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The trigger’s the little black thing.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Use these. They’re shredders. Equipped
with an explosive charge. When you fire the gun, they spray on impact.
Take out anything within ten yards.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: What are you gonna use?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: A little souvenir…</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Go bring the car around.</p>
<p><strong>ext. hallenbeck’s house - same time</strong>: Jimmy emerges,
starts across the lawn. Pulls up short. Stares ahead at:</p>
<p><strong>his pov - two black sedans</strong>: parked at the curb.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: He starts to cry out – And a dark
figure looms behind him. Clubs him in the head.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallenbeck’s bedroom - same time</strong>: Hallenbeck
snaps a full magazine into the rifle. Stuffs extras into a black
Windbreaker. Hears a NOISE. Looks up, expecting Jimmy – Draws a sharp
breath:</p>
<p><strong>pablo and assorted goons</strong>: standing in the doorway.
All of them have guns. Pablo grins, shakes his head:</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Face it, pal. You’re fucked by God.</p>
<p><strong>pad and paper</strong>: as they’re placed in front of
Hallenbeck. He is seated on the bed. Three guns covering him. Beside him
sits Furry Tom, grinning his stuffed-toy grin.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Are you a literate man, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I got a subscription to Jugs
magazine.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: That’s good. See, Joe, what you’re gonna do,
you’re gonna write a little story.</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: We’ve got Jimmy Dix in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Get him out of here. Take him to Mr. Marcon.
I’ll follow you as soon as my business here is finished.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Yeah, you’re gonna write a little story, Joe.
About how guilt- stricken you are over Senator Baynard’s death, which is
all over the air waves, by the way. Yeah… you’re so guilty about paying
those hitmen to kill him, that you’re gonna kill yourself.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hey, who’s writing this story? You’re
doing all the good parts.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Oh, and, Joe…? Don’t forget to include how
guilty you are over that cop you murdered.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: What cop?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Pablo draws his pistol. PUMPS TWO SHOTS
into the unconscious cop in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: That one.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You son of a bitch…!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: We don’t like Pablo very much, do we,
Furry Tom…?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: No, Mr. Hallenbeck, we think Pablo is a
motherless fuck who takes it up the ass.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: Shit, is he doing that?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Furry Tom, tell Pablo what I’m gonna do
to him.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You’re gong to make Pablo eat all his
teeth, Mr. Hallenbeck.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Pablo can’t help it. He bursts out
laughing.</p>
<p><strong>pablo</strong>: That’s amazing, man!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they’re laughin’ at
me. That’s not very nice.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Are you mad, Furry Tom?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I don’t get mad. I get even.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: His Presidential Medal of Valor. Shiny
medal. Shiny ribbon. His name… It hits him quite suddenly: The medal has
sharp edges. With the last of his strength, he plucks it from the wall.
Drives it into Pablo’s throat. The big man stumbles backward. Eyes wide.
Gurgling. He thrashes, the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely from
his gushing neck. Drops to the dusty carpet. Dies.</p>
<p><strong>int. conrad marcon’s living room - night</strong>: Jimmy Dix
is on the floor, and Marcon is kicking him savagely. Pointed alligator
boots lashing out. Again and again.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: You know I don’t enjoy doin’ this, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: I remember how much you hated the pain… You
got hooked on Demerol, didn’t you…? I’ll make a deal with you. Tell me
who you talked to, and I’ll give you all the painkillers you can
swallow.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Nobody knows. Just… just me… and
Hallenbeck…</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Now, see, I’d love to believe you. But we
are talking about the future of my football team.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He crosses to the fireplace. Removes a
poker.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: And ain’t nothin’ more important than my
ball club, ’cept maybe my collection of autographed footballs. Got one
of yours, you know. Who’d you talk to, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Nobody…</p>
<p><strong>ext. hollywood hills - night</strong>: Hallenbeck leaves the
rented Subaru by the side of the road. He is dressed in combat black.
Government issue. Rifle over one shoulder. Hunting knife in a hip
scabbard. Like an angel of death, he moves into the brush. Heading down
the canyon.</p>
<p><strong>ext. marcon’s home - same time</strong>: An armed sentry
patrols the grounds. Below him, nighttime L.A. stretches to the Pacific.
Joe Hallenbeck emerges like a wraith from the trees. Clamps a gloved
hand over the sentry’s mouth. Drives the hunting knife into his
back.</p>
<p><strong>int. living room - same time</strong>: Marcon stirs the
fireplace logs, stoking the blaze. Replaces the poker. Crosses to his
desk and sits. Jimmy is on the carpet, delirious. Out of it. Marcon
presses a button. An armed HARDGUY appears.</p>
<p><strong>hardguy</strong>: Mr. Marcon?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: He’s nothing, he can’t hurt us. Take him
somewhere and kill him.</p>
<p><strong>hardguy</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>joe hallenbeck</strong>: steps through the French doors
behind him. He resembles nothing human. A demon in black. Eyes burning.
Gun held loosely. An extension of his arm. Marcon reaches for the button
to summon help.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The gun is silenced, I’ll fuckin’ kill
you. Where’s my wife?</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: I… I don’t remember, I…</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: My wife.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The address. Now!</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: It’s… Milo’s film studio…</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Write it down, dumbfuck.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He speaks over his shoulder:</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Jimmy, you okay…?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hurts like hell.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Okay, Connie, you’re gonna walk us out
of here, nice and easy, got it? Can you walk, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yeah… I think so – Joe, behind you…!</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You drop it, asshole, or I kill
Marcon.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: Sorry, but that won’t work. I don’t
care if he lives or dies, now drop the gun.</p>
<p><strong>strange man</strong>: Walk over there by your friend,
Joe.</p>
<p><strong>louis baynard</strong>: Son of the late senator. The right
side of his face doesn’t quite match the left. The muscles don’t work.
Hallenbeck recovers his composure. As Jimmy climbs to his feet, Joe
walks over and stands next to him. Two gunmen appear behind them,
covering the rear.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Well, Goddamn. How’s the head, Lou?</p>
<p><strong>baynard</strong>: Aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just
lovely.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Next time, Lou, just say no.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Shit. This is the drunk guy you slugged, look
what you did to his face!</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him
kill me!</p>
<p><strong>baynard</strong>: Nothing more or less than you’d do for me,
Conrad. I never thought I’d see you again, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Speaking of which, what the fuck are you
doing here?</p>
<p><strong>baynard</strong>: Call it a financial partnership. For a
price, I agreed to connect Mr. Marcon to the necessary people in
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: In other words, you dropped your
father’s name a bunch of times.</p>
<p><strong>baynard</strong>: But imagine my delight this morning, Joe,
when Mr. Marcon informed me of a golden opportunity: a chance to kill my
father and frame you for the crime… What can I say, inherit a fortune
and humiliate you in the bargain, who could resist?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Do I also have you to thank for dragging
me into this mess?</p>
<p><strong>baynard</strong>: It was I, unfortunately, who bought a
forty-dollar bottle of champagne… spoke a little too freely to that
hooker.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: She wasn’t a hooker, dickhead.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: He should know, Jimmy. With a face like
that, he’s gotta be paying for it.</p>
<p><strong>baynard</strong>: You can die fast or slow, so watch your
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We’d rather watch yours. It’s
goofy-lookin’.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Kill them, Goddammit, waste ’em both!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Any bright ideas, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Gimmee a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Excuse me, could you give him a minute? He’s
trying to think of a way out of this.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Behind them, the two hardguys COCK their
GUNS. Jimmy sweats. He’s scared shitless underneath. Hallenbeck clears
his throat:</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You know of course, Connie, that you’re
a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Let’s humor this asshole. What are you
talking about?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Nothing much, just that I made a phone
call from the boat on the way in.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: You called the cops? Fuck it, they can’t
prove a thing.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Oh, but I didn’t call the cops. I called
the mob.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: See, Connie, every year, the mob rakes
in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. If you succeed in
making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government. I wouldn’t
be surprised if they put out a contract on you. Of course, I might be
able to call it off.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: He’s bluffing. He’s not connected to the
mob, what a load of horseshit. Nice try, asshole. Kill them.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Then there’s the matter of two million
dollars. Or didn’t you know that watertight suitcases float…?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’ve got your money, Connie. Stashed in
the back of a rented Subaru. We’ll take you to it.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Jesus, I don’t believe it. This guy’s a
riot.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t think it’s working, Joe. Try another
one.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Hell, I’m fresh out. You wanna try one,
kid, go for it.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Fuck you, Joe, I’m not just gonna stand here
and die. Mr. Marcon, he’s lying. We do have the money, but it’s not in a
car, it’s in a storage locker. I have the key on me. I’l hand it over if
you let me go.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Where is the key, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s stashed in my shorts.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: All right. Slow and easy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Sure. Slow and easy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Promise you’ll let me go.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Hell with that, son. Hand it over or I’ll
have you kneecapped.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Oh, yeah? Well, that’s too bad. See, it’s one
of those new plastic keys. The kind that melt…?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I guess nobody gets the money.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Pull it out of there!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Baynard draws down on Jimmy, who picks
up a flaming log and hurls it, knocks the SHOT wild, as: Marcon darts
out the French doors, into the night, so Hallenbeck spins, FIRES at
Baynard – Blows him backward in a bloody spray. Baynard sags against the
mantel. Collapses, dead. ECHOES. Silence. Jimmy and Joe are alone with
three corpses. Jimmy snatches up a pistol. Joe slings the sniper rifle
over his shoulder. Stares at Jimmy:</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Plastic keys…? The kind that melt?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hey. Short notice, best I could do.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: You did fine, junior.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Learned it from a pro. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>ext. marcon’s house - night</strong>: The wooden garage DOORS
EXPLODE outward, bursting to splinters, as a Ford BRONCO DRIVES right
THROUGH them, Conrad Marcon at the wheel. He careens off into the night.
Makes a getaway.</p>
<p><strong>int. garage - same time</strong>: Jimmy and Joe come racing
out of the house, just in time to see Marcon’s taillights disappearing
up the canyon.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Forget about him. Let’s get my wife.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>ext. marcon’s house - same time</strong>: The Mercedes
barrels out through the splintered garage doors. BURNS RUBBER down the
hill.</p>
<p><strong>int. car - driving</strong>: They stare straight ahead.
Tense. Breathless.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: On my way, honey, on my way…</p>
<p><strong>ext. hollywood hills - night</strong>: Conrad Marcon,
meanwhile, is rocketing along the winding road, heading up the canyon,
when he sees something ahead:</p>
<p><strong>his pov - joe’s rental subaru</strong>: sitting abandoned in
the roadside brush.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Acting on a sudden hunch, he SLAMS ON
the BRAKES. Stops the car. Gets out, crosses to the rental. Peeks in. A
two-million-dollar suitcase sits, pretty as punch, on the back seat.</p>
<p><strong>marcon</strong>: Shit, Joe Boy, you wasn’t bluffing…</p>
<p><strong>ext. downtown hollywood - night</strong>: A block of
seedy-looking brick buildings. Off Sunset. Not many people at this
hour.</p>
<p><strong>mercedes</strong>: slews around the corner races down the
street, running without headlights. Lurches to a halt near the mouth of
an alley. Jimmy and Joe burst from the car, guns in hand. Hellenbeck is
grim, purposeful. Jimmy is nervous.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I’m new at this, Joe. How do we do it?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: We get in, we get out. Shoot anyone
who’s not my wife. Check that: Don’t shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>lockpick</strong>: inserted in the latch of a back door.
Hallenback finds the tumblers. Springs the lock in seconds.</p>
<p><strong>sentry</strong>: seated outside a wooden door. .38 special in
a shoulder rig. Sees them, leaps to his feet, gun clearing leather – Joe
blows him out of his socks. TWO-SHOT BURST. Silenced. Guy hits the wall.
Paints it with blood. Flops, dead. Jimmy and Joe step over him. Joe
braces himself. Draws back his foot. Kicks the door, as:</p>
<p><strong>int. studio - same time</strong>: The door flies open.
Doesn’t hit the wall. Something stops it. Joe doesn’t blink. He puts the
rifle against the panel. FIRES three SHOTS through the wood. Keeps
going. A body falls out from behind the door. Joe doesn’t even look. The
body sits up. Not dead yet… Jimmy comes through the door. SHOOTS him.
Follows Joe.</p>
<p><strong>movie set</strong>: Lights. Camera. The wrong kind of
action.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: on a bed, naked. bright lights on her. Around
her, a director. A cameraman.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: with a chainsaw.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Cut.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He strokes her hair. Speaking softly.
Quietly. Speaking to the only woman he’s ever loved:</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’m here… it’s all right… I’m here…</p>
<p><strong>ext. sidewalk - night</strong>: Sarah is now dressed, as Joe
supports her across the sidewalk toward the stolen Mercedes. He turns to
Jimmy. Hands him a set of keys.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Drive one of their cars. They won’t be
needing them.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Where do you want me to go?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: The two million bucks is still in the
Subaru. Parked on Mulholland above Marcon’s house. Go pick it up and
bring it to the office. We’re gonna go get Darian.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Yes, massah.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: I’ll take you and Darian to the office.
You can sleep there.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why can’t we go home?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: There’s four corpses in the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>establishing shot - joe’s office</strong>: in the shadow of
the freeway. The night wears on. From the billboard, Gorgeous continues
to entice.</p>
<p><strong>int. hallenbeck’s office - same time</strong>: Darian is
asleep, cradled in her mother’s arms. Her mother is awake, cradled in
Joe’s arms.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Jimmy should be here any minute. Then we
gotta talk to the cops.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Will the police catch Marcon?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Maybe. He’s probably in some secret
crash pad, packing to leave town.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I remember when we got married… My friends
would talk about their husbands. They’d say, ‘Oh, my husband is a
big-time publisher,’ or, ‘My husband is a brilliant lawyer…’ I used to
say, ‘My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich
without puking.’</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Don’t knock it. It’s a skill.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I want to try, Joe. Do you still want to
try?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Ahh, shit. Looks like the local
constable has come to chat.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Shall we invite him in?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: No. Stay here. I’ll deal with it.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He gets up, throws on a jacket.</p>
<p><strong>ext. joe’s office - night</strong>: Joe exits the office,
starts across the lawn toward the vehicle with the flashing light.
Realizes with a sudden shock: something’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: That’s not L.A.P.D….</p>
<p><strong>patrol.</strong>: In the same glance, he sees there’s a dead
cop slumped in the passenger seat, and worse, much worse than that: Milo
is in the driver’s seat.</p>
<p><strong>wider angle</strong>: Milo, who steps out of the car and
promptly OPENS FIRE on Joe.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>int. office - same</strong>: Sarah sits bolt upright. Eyes
panicked. Terrified. Darian comes awake, screaming:</p>
<p><strong>darian</strong>: Mommy, what’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>ext. office - same</strong>: Hallenbeck spins behind one of
the billboard support legs, as BULLETS CHOP it to splinters.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: advances. changing clips. Methodical. Precise.
Like a robot. He is obsessed. All vestige of sanity gone.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You fucked up my face, Joseph!</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: Don’t try to hide, Joseph. I’ve got all night,
you fucked up my face.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: huddles behind the billboard as the
bullets stitch upward. Through the wooden frame. A hot SLUG RIPS through
Joe’s arm. An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain. Rolls away from the
gunfire. Looks around. Desperate. Sees a painter’s bucket lying nearby.
He counts to three.</p>
<p><strong>down below</strong>: Milo calmly changes clips. Hallenbeck
bursts from cover. Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the
front of the billboard, hard and fast – BULLETS CHOPPING the board right
behind him, blowing holes in Gorgeous’s derrierre – And then Joe does a
risky thing: He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full tilt,
and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he doing?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: He’s trying to make the freeway. It’s a
good fifteen feet. Try it sometime. He flies through open air – Milo’s
GUN CHATTERING below, seeking him out – And just does make it. Hits the
freeway surface and collapses forward, screaming as he rolls on his
injured arm… Looks up –</p>
<p><strong>int. subaru - driving</strong>: Jimmy Dix is actually on the
freeway, driving, when he looks across the center divider and sees
Hallenbeck.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I don’t fucking believe it.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: watches in dismay as Milo climbs onto
the platform… Walks across the front of the billboard. Toward the
freeway. Toward Joe. Snarling. Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground.
Heaves it. Milo puts up an arm, catches a glancing blow. Blood flows.
All it does is piss him off.</p>
<p><strong>milo</strong>: You ruined my flesh!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Hallenbeck dives flat to the road as
Milo opens up again, a chattering BURST of GUNFIRE. The muzzle flash is
blinding. The windshield of a passing car SHATTERS – The driver panics,
the car spins out of control – Slews across the road in the middle of
traffic. COLLISIONS. CRUMPLING METAL. EXPLOSIONS of GLASS.</p>
<p><strong>car</strong>: slides straight toward Hallenbeck.</p>
<p><strong>sarah hallenbeck</strong>: below, on the lawn. She aims Joe’s
service revolver and says:</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You just fucking die.</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: She’s something, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>hallenbeck</strong>: stares, dumbfounded at Sarah. She look
up at him. A moment passes between them. Around Hallenbeck, a sea of
crumpled cars. HORNS BLARING. Amidst it all, he stands. Beaten. Bloody.
Bullet-scarred. Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe.
They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says:</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: The car’s over on the other side. C’mere, I
want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>ext. 405 freeway - southbound lane - night</strong>: Jimmy
and Joe stand in the breakdown lane next to the rented Subaru. Jimmy
points to the shattered window.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Somebody broke in and swiped the suitcase
from the back seat. Had to be Marcon, right?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Son of a bitch got the wrong one!</p>

last of his needed possessions into a travel bag. Hefts it. Puts it near
the door.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Crosses to the bed, where the other
suitcase lies. Looks at it. Smiles, contented. Can’t help himself. He
reaches out. Flicks the latch. Opens it. There is a note taped to the
inside:</p>
<p><strong>ext. downtown skyscraper - 32nd floor - night</strong>:
Marcon’s flaming corpse is BLOWN OUT through the glass, along with his
earthly possessions. He plummets like a meteor.</p>
<p><strong>east l.a. sidestreet - night</strong>: Two ten-year-old black
boys are walking down the street. Out strolling in the poverty that
exists in the shadow of the skyscrapers. Quite suddenly, without warning
– A football drops out of the sky. Hits and bounces, very high – Comes
down. Settles. Rocks, back and forth. The kids look up, puzzled.
Searching the sky.</p>
