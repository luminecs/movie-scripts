<h1 id="hardcore">hardcore</h1>
<p><strong>aunt</strong>: …He got accepted at Grand Valley, but he’d
rather go to Michigan…</p>
<p><strong>nephew #1</strong>: …Get that pink rot…</p>
<p><strong>nephew #2</strong>: …No way Uncle Joe talk me into cutting
celery again this summer. Rather work in the car wash.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: …I still say that if a man has committed the
unpardonable sin, he knows he has.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: I don’t know about that, John. It don’t seem to
account much for God’s grace.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What kind of grace do you mean, universal or
specific…?</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: I’m sick of watching this television stuff. You
know who makes it? All the kids who couldn’t get along here. They go out
to California and make television. I didn’t like ’em when they were
here, and I don’t like ’em out there.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Television. If you don’t buy one yourself, the
kids go someplace else and watch. And what do they sell on television?
More televisions.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They got to make their money, too, Joe. Give
the kids a break. It’s Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: …and they hadn’t heard a word from him before
he died.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: Aunt Ruth, can we use Timmy for the Nativity
play? We need him to play the Christ-child.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: But Timmy’s only six months old.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: We won’t hurt him. I’m going to be Joseph,
Jane’s Mary and Lenard will be one of the shepherds.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: I don’t think so…</p>
<p><strong>nadine</strong>: You can’t do that. That’s blasphemy. If
anybody pretends to be Christ, it’s blasphemy.</p>
<p><strong>bill</strong>: But he’s only a baby.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Your dad and I aren’t sure you and Kristen
should go on the YC Convention tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Oh, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: I don’t know, Kristen, that’s a long trip to be
on a bus with all those boys.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: You mean those creeps.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: There are more chaperones than boys
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We thank the Lord for bringing this family
together at graduation time. We ask Thee to watch over this family and
keep us together in the coming year.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sis, would you check if Kristen has everything
packed?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: You want to go for coffee after we send the
girls off?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. Thanks anyway. I’ve got to get over to the
office.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Anne wants to make sure you come over for
dinner Sunday. With Kristen gone you’ll be all alone.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steensma</strong>: …Daverman, DeBeer, DeBoer, DeJong,
DeVries…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steensma</strong>: …Vander Ark, Vander Hoven, Vander
Keen, Van Dorn, Van Dyke, E., Van Dyke, S…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Take care of yourself, Kristen. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I will, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If you need anything, just call.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Is this all the display space we can get?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I tried to get more, but this is the limit.
The De Vries line has the same area.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you think of this… ah, shade of blue,
Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I like it, Mr. Van Dorn.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Don’t you think it’s a little too… bright?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Not really. But if you want me to tone it
down…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, no. I wouldn’t hire a display designer if
I didn’t trust her taste. Maybe we should bring in more of that shade.
Perhaps a stripe across the back wall.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, that would be much too overpowering.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, overpowering. That was the word I was
looking for.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. Van Dorn, I’ve worked on the color scheme
for weeks. I think it’s just right.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s that shade of blue called?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Pavonine. It’s the same tint as the stripe in
the fabric.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Are you still going with that fella that
teaches at Grand Valley?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah. He’s a nice guy. Don’t lose him. Maybe
we could tone down this stripe a bit. It’s a little…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Overpowering?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Okay, Mr. Van Dorn, I think we could knock
that Pavonine blue a bit.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Are you sure it’s all right?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. I think it’ll look better.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Kristen went on that convention today, didn’t
she?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah. How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Even though the doctrinal standards were
written a long time ago, I think they are more relevant than ever.
Especially in this age of permissiveness and “anything goes…”</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: You going to Knott’s Berry Farm with
him?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: He asked me. You going with anybody?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: You ever play Chicken?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: You never heard of that?</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Com’on, tell me.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Well, a boy goes like this, see.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: What does that do?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Well, each time he comes in closer, like
this.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: He keeps coming closer until you say
“Chicken.” Then he stops.</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: You and Jerry do that?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steensma</strong>: Kristen, Marsha! Time for your
discussion group.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Oh, all right.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steensma</strong>: And put your name tags back on.</p>
<p><strong>rev. vantil</strong>: …our study of the Heidelberg Catechism,
reading today Lords Day number one, question and answer one and two: Q:
What is your only comfort in life and death? A: That I, body and soul,
both in life and death, am not my own but belong unto my faithful Savior
Jesus Christ. Q: How many things are necessary to know to live and die
happily? A: Three: the first, how great my sin and misery are; the
second, how I am delivered from all my sin and misery; the third, how I
am to be thankful to God for such deliverance.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: …as soon as the service starts, the ushers all
go off to Big Boy’s and have coffee…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’ll get it. So that when someone like
Mrs. Van Dorn in a wheelchair needs some help there’s nobody there.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It’s for you, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Well, I just hope I don’t get old and in a
wheelchair and have to depend on the ushers to help me out of church.
You would never let that happen to your mother, would you?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: What is it, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Wes, Anne, come here a moment.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That was Mrs. Steensma calling from
California. Kristen’s disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Kristen?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They don’t know. They were having some
recreation deal out at Knott’s Berry Farm and Kristen wasn’t there when
they got back to the bus and they couldn’t find her.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Have they called the police?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Is Marsha there?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah. She’s quite upset. I’m going to fly out
today. They want me to bring some pictures.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: I’ll come with you. Let me pack some
things.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: …They have a ride called “The Great White
Knuckler”, a roller coaster. Last time I saw Kristen was standing over
there…</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Why was she alone?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Was she alone?</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: I told this to the policeman.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steensma</strong>: They had met an older boy
earlier.</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: But she wasn’t with him when I saw her
last.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steensma</strong>: She tried to give the officers a
description. It was nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>burrows</strong>: The boy your daughter was talking to didn’t
work at the park. We’ve interviewed everybody there.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But is she, has…</p>
<p><strong>burrows</strong>: There’s no evidence of any foul play at
present. I hope she’s just a runaway.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s something wrong here. Kristen is not
the type of girl to just up and leave.</p>
<p><strong>burrows</strong>: I said I hope she’s a runaway. Better that
than she just disappears like so many others do. Sometimes they turn up
years later, sometimes not. A lot of crimes go unreported, unknown.
These are realities.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>burrows</strong>: Two officers have been assigned to the
case. I can’t keep them on indefinitely, but we’ll go through every
lead.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Those cops, like all cops, are intelligent
enough, but they are masters of de-ductive reason. That is, you ask them
what three and two are they’ll tell you five, but if you ask them what
five is, they go blank. That’s spec-u-lative reasoning, and that’s where
I come in.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, what do they know?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Dogshit. Worse yet, they don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: So then, Mr. Mast…</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Andy.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: …What do you have to offer?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Let me ask you a personal question, a painful
one. The first of many. Tell me, was your daughter the kind of girl to
run around, to, ah, play practical jokes, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: No, I didn’t think she was. Let me get the
picture here. Let me guess. She was an absolutely clean girl, a model
daughter, she never had rebellious or impure thoughts, she didn’t fuck
around…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If I was you, Mr. Mast, I’d watch my
language.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Hey, I’m a private detective, Van Dorn, you
want to hire a choir boy you can go back to Grand Rapids. I’ve been to
that scumbag town. It’s full of them.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who’s paying you?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: You are.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: As I was saying, I’ll pick up the thread.
There’s a number of ways I can go. There’s not much you can do here.
Stay if you want. Maybe it’d be better if you went back home. Go through
Kristen’s personal stuff. Ask around, maybe she knew somebody out here.
Look, I do this a lot. I work at a minimum rate of $750.00 a week. It
may seem like a lot of money to you, but it ain’t. You could hire
cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: And better?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I suppose. But I’ll tell you, Jake, I’m like a
little animal. When I get my teeth into something I never let go. If
your daughter’s here, I’ll track her down.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Pilgrim, this is Andy. I’m in Phoenix. Yeah,
it looks that way. I don’t know why. I’m going south, then maybe fly
over to Nogales. I think so. Yeah, I picked up your check at Western
Union.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, I was up in Minneapolis. Somebody
responded to my ad. Said there was a girl who looked like Kristen there.
But it wasn’t her. The police haven’t found anything? It don’t look
good. I don’t know. Maybe she’s dead already.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I took a side trip to Mexico City. It was just
a long shot, but it didn’t pay off. So I’m back in L.A. Yeah, the money
came on time.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where’s Marsha?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Marsha!</p>
<p><strong>marsha</strong>: Uncle Jake.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Happy birthday, Marsha.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Spring’s early. Without a frost we’ll have a
good year.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Not as good as last.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lord’s been good to us.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: Never had to make a dishonest dollar in my
life. Never cheated an employee.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: How could you? They’re all your relatives.</p>
<p><strong>joe</strong>: The Lord got his share, too.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: How’s your business, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: You should come around more often. You haven’t
been around for weeks. Anne complains she doesn’t see you anymore.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: You can’t dwell on Kristen all the time, Jake.
Sometimes we can’t understand the Lord’s ways. He is testing you. You
have to have faith.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Would you? Could you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Mr. Van Dorn?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Mast?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where are you? The connection sounds very
good.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I’m back in Grand Rapids.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: In G.R.? Why?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Can you meet me in about an hour? At the
Pantlind Hotel?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ve got a meeting…</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: What are you paying me for?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: This used to be a real city. I was here about
fifteen years ago. Embezzlement case. It was always a little religious
for my taste, but at least it was a city. With a downtown and all.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What have you found out?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I’ve got some news. Your daughter’s all right.
At least I think she is.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Have you ever seen any, ah, pornographic
movies, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Do you know what a “hardcore” movie is?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s like a stag film.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Yeah. You ever seen any of those?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: They’re legal now.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They are?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Yeah. All over. Even here in Grand Rapids.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: There’s a little stall theatre up here. It’s
closed now, but I’m borrowing it for an hour. I think there’s something
you’d better see.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It can’t be. Why me? What have I done?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Turn it off. Turn it off. Turn it off! Turn it
off!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where did you get that film?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I bought it at a store in L.A.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who made it?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost
two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe
theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. ‘Nobody’ makes it;
‘nobody’ shows it; ‘nobody’ sees it. It’s like it doesn’t even
exist.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s it called?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: It was called ‘Slave of Love’ when I bought
it. Next time it’s sold, it’ll be called something else.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But the police…</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: The police? They know less than you do.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do you think she’s safe?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Yeah. Probably.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You like this, don’t you. Showing me…
this.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy. A lot of
strange things happen in this world. Things you don’t know about in
Grand Rapids. Things you don’t want to know about. Doors that should
never be opened. I’ve known more about this sort of thing than a man
should. Don’t ask me why.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I’m going back to L.A. today. I’ll track this
film down, if I can. I’ll find her. But I can’t make any promises. I
don’t know what she’ll be like when I find her.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: All right, kids, let’s get back to it.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Actors, to your positions, please.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Can’t you get this bed any warmer?</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: Bring another light over here.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: My ass is freezing.</p>
<p><strong>actor</strong>: Your ass is always freezing.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Up yours.</p>
<p><strong>second girl</strong>: He’s got it up.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Thank God.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Action. Rolling.</p>
<p><strong>cameraman</strong>: The wallpaper’s peeling again.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Forget it. Keep shooting.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: All right, Niki, you come around this way
and swing your legs around his back.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: All right, Niki, you’re lying back now,
yes, just taking it easy, just enjoying your body, yes, you’re thinking
about your father, your mind is open and free…</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Okay, now Bennie, you turn over and lick
her belly…</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: Hey, piss-head, what brings you around?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: You don’t have to get uppity with me, Bill. I
remember when you was running that car wash and couldn’t make it go. And
what was that other thing you tried? A Dairy Queen? Went busted too.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: At least I improved myself. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I want you to take a look at this girl here.
She’s been in some porn stuff.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: No, Andy. Don’t know the kid.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Look again, Billy-boy. This is jail bait.
Could get you in a lotta trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: Nope never saw her before. Kurt, come over
here. Don’t use underage kids. Wouldn’t touch ’em for all the cow shit
in Mexico. You recognize this piece of wool, Kurt?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: Sorry couldn’t help you, Andy. How’d the
shot go? They about ready to start again? You can come watch if you
want, Andy. Just don’t hassle anybody.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This is Jake. I’m going out of town for a
while. No, I don’t know when I’ll be back. No, there’s nothing wrong.
Can you keep things running? Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>teenage girl</strong>: It’s the cops, man.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>teenage girl</strong>: Who the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are you doing? You son-of-a- bitch! I’ve
been paying you every week for three months and you’ve been out
here…</p>
<p><strong>teenage girl</strong>: I’m splitting.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I ain’t cheated you, Pilgrim. This is
research, damn it! That girl could have told us something.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Research, my ass. I suppose these are the
‘extra expenses’ I’ve been paying for? And in the middle of the morning,
too.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Oh, fuck off. You should stay where you
belong.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Get out. Get out of here, Goddammit.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I’m only human, you know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: But this is my apartment.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Get out!</p>

your own Goddamn daughter now. I’m not even smart enough to lock my own
fucking door.</p>

<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s a short film.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: They’re all about the same. You want
something?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: This is from the movie I was talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I wondered if you had ever seen this film or
this woman… …right here.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: That girl? No, never saw her. I don’t know
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m just trying to find… Who owns this
store?</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: I don’t know. Look, man, if you’re looking
for somebody maybe you ought to see the cops.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But I…</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: I don’t know nothing, man.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: You don’t want anything for your fifty
cents?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>teller</strong>: Here. Take your fifty cents back.</p>

<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t really want… ‘body to body

<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: That you may discuss with the girl of your
choice in the privacy of your room.</p>
<p><strong>second hostess</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m looking for a girl. Have you ever been in
a porno film?</p>
<p><strong>second hostess</strong>: Come back with me. I’m sure you’ll
find what you want.</p>
<p><strong>thin man</strong>: I called on the phone. You have a

<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: Yeah. Did you bring your own domination

<p><strong>beatrice</strong>: You sure? We have regular sessions, too.
Only twenty dollars?</p>
<p><strong>teenage mexican</strong>: Sexo?</p>
<p><strong>second hostess</strong>: Si. Sexo. Sexo.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Hi, you been here before?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude
body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room.
Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements
may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We

<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Do you want to take a session?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I just want to ask some questions.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: You may do that in the privacy of your
room.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay. I’ll take a half hour.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Do you have any particular choice of
girl?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Wait a second. I’ve got to get a sheet.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: You’re still dressed?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, I want to…</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My
name’s Felice.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s a girl I want to ask you about.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: You’re not Vice, are you? Do you work for
the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation
with any law enforcement agency?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you
couldn’t deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn’t get
hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, actually I wanted to ask about this
girl. I have her picture here.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Pull out your cock.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Cops aren’t allowed to do that either. A
judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don’t ask me why. I guess he
figured the sight of a Vice Officer’s dong would make a girl unable to
stop herself.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, Felice, I’m not a cop. In fact, right now
I’ve got as little respect for the police as you do. I’m looking for a
girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Are you going to stiff me?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I
don’t get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get
two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my
money on tips.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You want a tip?</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere
from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: What do you want to tip me for? Look, you
got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ll give you a tip. Here’s forty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Now, what do you want?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I said I just wanted to talk to you…</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: That’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: …about this woman. I’m trying to find her. Do
you know her?</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Look, I don’t know anybody. I never seen her
before.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m getting angry.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Wait a minute, that’s going to cost you more
than forty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m getting angry. I want some answers.
Where’s the guy who runs this place?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I’m
going to talk to someone.</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: Wait?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where is he? Where’s the bastard that runs
this shit hole?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>felice</strong>: He’s causing trouble.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I got a picture here. I want you to tell me
where to find this woman. I been asking everybody. Nobody knows
anything.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Calm down, mister. You don’t want to get
the cops in here do you? You got a family?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t suppose you’ve ever seen this girl
before either? Her name’s Kristen, but I suppose you’ve never seen
her?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Why don’t you just go outdoors, mister?
Cool off.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Cool off, huh? How’s this for cooling off?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hold it, mister.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What do you think of that? Or this?</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Ramada can see you now.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: Hello, Mr. Holcum. You look out of breath.
What’s the matter? The elevator broke? Is the elevator broke?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No. I walked up. Don’t ride elevators.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: My secretary said you wanted to discuss a
business proposition.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes. I’m interested in financing an adult
feature film. I was told you were the man to come to.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: Film making can be pretty expensive…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ve got fifty thousand dollars to invest.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: Oh. Why is it that you want to get into film
financing?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well, Bill – mind if I call you Bill? Let me
be frank. I’ve made a lot of money. I’ve got my own business in Detroit.
Rivets. I make rivets and sell them to Fisher Body. Well, rivets, you
know, can get pretty boring after a while. When my business manager told
me I should shelter some money, I thought I’d try this.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: What exactly do you have in mind?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I thought I’d invest in a film. I want to sort
of become involved in the process of making a film, meet the people who
make films, learn how it’s done…</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: In other words, you want to get laid?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Not exactly…</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: It’s cool. Why do you think I got in the
movies? How much poon do you think you get in the car wash business?
Look, fifty thousand dollars buys a lot of pussy. You can get your joint
pulled by beautiful girls every night for the rest of your life for
fifty thousand dollars. So why fuck with the movie business?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s an investment.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: If you want to watch when we shoot a film,
for fifty bucks, I let guys stand around and watch. It’s a lot
cheaper.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I thought you were a businessman.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: Don’t get me wrong. A couple years ago, I
woulda jumped at fifty thousand dollars possible financing. But the
Lord’s been good to me. I can now finance any films I choose. Big ones,
small ones. Right now we’re setting up a two hundred thousand dollar
feature film. Live sound. I like to keep my own money in my films. That
way you don’t have to share the profits. There’s plenty of guys in town
that’ll take it, though. But if I was you, Mr… what was your name
again?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Jake.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: …I’d just start my own business. That’s what
I did. Get into kid porn. That’s big now. Why don’t you come around the
set? Meet some people. If you still want to invest, I’ll ask around.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Sounds all right.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: Okay. Keep in touch with my secretary.</p>
<p><strong>ramada</strong>: So long, Mr. Jake.</p>

<p><strong>niki</strong>: She thinks so. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I work with Ramada. We’re doing some pictures
together.</p>

places.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: We’ll come in for a closeup here.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: What’s going on, Jake?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Jake?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How did you find me?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: I called every L.A. hotel. The Holiday Inn gave
this as a referral number. Your office said you had no business in New
York, so I figured you had come out here. What’s happening, Jake? What
are you doing? Nobody’s heard from you. Anne’s worried sick. We didn’t
know if you were dead or alive.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Wes, do me a favor.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Leave me alone. Go home. Go away.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just do what I say. Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: What is going on?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I think I’ve found a way to find Kristen. I
have a plan. But I have to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: What plan?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You don’t want to know. Now, Wes, leave,
please. For me.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: What will I tell the others? They care about
you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tell them anything you want. Tell them I’m on
a vacation, a business trip. Tell them I needed a rest. Tell them
anything, just don’t tell them…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: …just don’t tell them about this. Now go.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>stud #1</strong>: Jake? Mr. Holcum?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Pete? Come in.</p>
<p><strong>stud #1</strong>: Yeah. Peter Long. That’s the name I
use.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We’re casting male roles in an explicit sex
action feature. The pay is $100 a day. There’ll be up to two weeks work.
You say you’ve had experience?</p>
<p><strong>stud #1</strong>: I was in the Mitchell Brothers’ film,
‘Sodom and Gomorrah.’ I don’t know if you saw that. I played Damon, the
slave of the Queen of Gomorrah.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yes, this is Jake. We’re casting right now.
Have you had experience in hardcore films? I can fit you in from 4:00 -
4:15 today. At the Players Motel, 777 Vine, Room 106. We’ll see you
then.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: All right, Pete. I have your exchange here. If
we decide to use you, we’ll give you a call.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You’re not exactly the type we’re looking
for.</p>
<p><strong>black stud</strong>: You mean I’m black?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No, just not the type.</p>
<p><strong>black stud</strong>: What do you mean, not the type? Don’t
you know who I am? I’m Big Dick Brown! I’ve been in more porno movies
than you ever saw. I’ve worked with Harry Reems. I’ve worked with Johnny
Wad. Not the type! I can come ten times a day. I can keep it hard two
hours at a time. My cock is nine inches long.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Brown. I’m sure you’re very
good, but at the moment, I’ve got nothing for you. If something comes
up, we’ll give you a call.</p>
<p><strong>black stud</strong>: Shit! You just don’t want to hire a
nigger, that’s all. I knew this was a scam. I shouldn’ta come.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m sorry, but you’re just not the type we are
looking for. We had something else in mind.</p>
<p><strong>stud #2</strong>: Don’t you want to see my stuff, man?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What stuff?</p>
<p><strong>stud #2</strong>: You know, my stuff!</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: Hey man.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: We’re casting for an explicit sex action
feature…</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: I know. Word’s out on the street – word’s
also out you ain’t really hiring anyone.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s not true, Mr…?</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: Jim Sullivan. Sometimes they call me Jism
Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s not true, Jim. In fact, I think you’re
very close to the type we’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: Oh yeah? I’ve done a lot of good stuff.
Shorts, features. No major roles it’s true. But good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s what I wanted to talk to you about.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ve seen you in some stuff. I like your
looks. I particularly liked you in this film.</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: Oh yeah? I remember that. It was made by
some college kids.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It was called ‘Slave of Love.’</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: God, I don’t know what it was called. I
never saw it. I only got twenty- five bucks for the whole Goddamned
thing.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I thought you were quite good in it. I also
like the girl in it. Really thought she was good. I wondered if she was
still around. If she was still working.</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: Wait. Wait a minute. Look, I need the work
and I want to be in your picture, but that is one bitch I will never
work with again.</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: Look, that was one freaky bitch, one very,
very freaky bitch. I don’t know what she was into, I don’t know what she
was on, but I don’t want to have anything to do with her again.</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: Do you know what she did to me? Do you
know what she did to me, man? That fucking cunt! I couldn’t walk for a
week. My prick was sore and red and chewed out. She was cra-zy. I don’t
want to work with her again.</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: Hey, stop, stop. I’ll do anything you
want. It’s okay. I can dig it. You can do anything you want to me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where is she? Where is the girl?</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: She’s got a man. A white guy. Tod
something or other.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where does he hang out?</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where!</p>
<p><strong>jism jim</strong>: Look, I know this chick Niki. She works at
Les Girls. She would know. Honest.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I was told to meet a girl named Niki here.</p>
<p><strong>les girls woman</strong>: In one of the booths. Any of the
first three.</p>
<p><strong>les girls woman</strong>: It’s five dollars for two
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>les girls woman</strong>: Five dollars a token.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Here. I’ll take two.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Are you Niki?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that
picture?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Too bad. I wasn’t in it.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: It’s your money. You talk.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m making a film. Jim Sullivan’s going to be
in it. He said you might know where Tod is.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Do I know you? Weren’t you on the set the
other night? With Ramada.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You making a feature?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Um-hm. Live sound.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Got any parts? I’m free. Not free- free, but,
you know, free. I don’t really do this.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Jim and I have been trying to run down a girl.
Do you know her?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Joanne?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know her?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: No. I saw her with Tod.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do you know where she lives?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do you know where she would be?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Tod might know.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where’s he?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Last I heard he went to San Diego.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: If we went there, would you be able to find
him?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You’re not a film producer, are you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: How much do you make a week, Niki?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Are you a private detective?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Something like that. How much do you make?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Here? What a joke. There was some detective
asking about that girl.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Three hundred?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: This is just temporary. I once made nine
hundred in outcall.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ll give you $700 a week, cash, if you help
me find this girl.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Up front?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Half now, half later.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Make it nine hundred. That was my best
week.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay. My client pays for it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: When do we start?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tonight. When you get out, we’ll go. Why
didn’t you tell the other detective?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: This is different. This is nine hundred
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Mr. Mast? My name’s Wes DeJong. I’m Jake Van
Dorn’s brother-in-law. We met out here a couple months ago when he hired
you. Your agency said you might be here.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Ssh. I’m on a stakeout.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I’m staking out this beer bottle. Trying to
find out if I’ll finish it or it’ll finish me.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: I’m worried about Jake.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I’m off that case. He fired me.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: He didn’t look good at all. Something strange
is going on. He’s got himself into some trouble. He wouldn’t say
what.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I’ll tell you, that was an interesting case.
The Van Dorn girl. I’ve handled runaway cases like it before. Usually
when you put the pressure on the porn underworld for an underage kid,
she pops up in about a week. Everybody denies ever seeing her, but there
she is at the airport with a prepaid ticket home. Well, I put pressure
on all over town for this girl and it stayed cold as ice. In fact,
certain people for this girl and – nothing. I guess I gave your
brother-in-law sort of a raw deal.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Hey, buddy, E-fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: I want to rehire you. To find out what’s
happening to my brother-in- law.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I’ve been on another case. All day. I suppose
I can move it over. Seven fifty a week, plus travel expenses.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: Do you really think Kristen is just a
runaway?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: I also want you to protect my brother-
in-law.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: You have to understand. He can be mean,
self-righteous. He had a Vishund once. Loved that dog. He came home one
day and the dog bit him. He took that dog and staked him out in the back
yard. It was winter. Every day he came home and watched that dog until
he froze. He’s capable of doing anything.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: To his own daughter?</p>
<p><strong>wes</strong>: To anybody.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You actually paid for both these rooms? I
thought you were just going to get a receipt for two, and kickback the
desk man.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: I thought you were going to bed?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Do you have any pills? Any Valium, Librium?
You know, pimps will sell Valium at fifty cents a piece. Can you believe
that?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You know Valiums pick me right up? Take four
or five and I’m wide awake. Isn’t that strange? Know what puts me to
sleep? Coke. I think I’m really fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Niki. Calm down. Relax. Let’s just talk for a
while. Then, later, you’ll go back to your room and we’ll get some
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You have anything to drink? You want to go out
and get something?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t drink, but you can go out.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You don’t drink?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ulcers.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You’re not a private detective either, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: I didn’t think so. I’ve fucked detectives. Who
are you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: A friend.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Of Joanne’s?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah. I’m her father.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Her name is Kristen. She disappeared a couple
of months ago.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: And your wife? Where’s she?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Hey, don’t worry about it. Your daughter’s
around. We’ll find her in a couple days.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Jim Rucker runs this place. He knows where
everybody is. It’s a nice place. Hires a lot of girls, but they don’t
pay shit.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Is Rucker here?</p>
<p><strong>bar maid</strong>: He’ll be back in a couple hours.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Tell him Louise was here. I’ll come back
later.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You really shouldn’t eat like that. All that
sugar. It’s not good for you.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: At least I’m a growing person.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You won’t keep growing at this rate.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: What rate?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You never met a working girl before, have you?
You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what? You
can’t even say it, can you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Say what?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: ‘Sucking off.’</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay. Sucking off. Now does that make me as
good as you?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You don’t understand shit.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay, tell me. Why do you live like you
do?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Did you ever live in a room with six people
and you didn’t have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your
brother come out, his car break down, he can’t get a job? Your friends
stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Is that the way it was with you?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: No. But does it make any difference? How did
you get to be the way you are?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Don’t knock it. A girl can save up a lot money
doing this – big money. Then you’re free. You can go off to Europe, meet
somebody, get married. My girlfriend’s going to buy her own beauty
parlor. Not me. I’m gonna travel. ‘Keep movin’ that’s my motto. Would
you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every
two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc… doing
what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You used to work at Copper Penny?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You and I, Niki, have very different ideas
about sex.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Why? Are you a sex fiend?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Neither am I.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But it’s all you do.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: How important do you think sex is?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Not very.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: We’re just alike. You think sex is so
unimportant you don’t do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don’t care
who I do it with.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You can never understand a person like me. I
am a mystery to you. A middle class person, a Mid-westerner. A man who
doesn’t pursue women. A man who believes in social order. A man who goes
to church, believes in God, and a man who, at the end of his life,
believes he will be redeemed. This is all unfathomable to you.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t see why I must justify myself to you.
I don’t care about the things you do. I don’t care what’s happening in
New York or Los Angeles. I don’t care about movies or TV. I don’t care
who’s on Johnny Carson.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: What do you care about?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I care about my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with
squeeze.</p>
<p><strong>rucker</strong>: You working in San Diego now?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: I’m still in L.A., but I’m looking for Tod. I
heard he was around.</p>
<p><strong>rucker</strong>: ‘Was.’ He and that shitheel Ratan went down
to T-J. Maybe I shouldn’t say that. Anyway, I hear he’s back in Frisco
now.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Was he with a girl?</p>
<p><strong>rucker</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>rucker</strong>: Keep in touch, baby. Got some good stuff
comin’ up. Need you back, baby. And take good care of your friend for
me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What’s T-J?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Tijuana.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They were here?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Tod was. He was with Ratan.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What does that mean? What does he do?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: He deals in pain.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Is Kristen safe?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Let’s get a plane for San Francisco.</p>
<p><strong>burrows</strong>: Apparently your friend has gone into
Mexico. A Border Guard responded to the APB. How does it feel to have
the L.A.P.D. doing your work for you?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: You’re going to thank me for this. You know
what the media’s like. They love this kinda shit. If that guy goes off
half-cocked and gets himself hurt, you’re going to have so much bad
publicity, you…</p>
<p><strong>burrows</strong>: I heard you the first time. We had nothing
to go on with this kid. Just a runaway. Do you really think he’s in
danger?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: If he has anything to say about it, yeah. I’ve
been asking a lot of questions and I don’t like the answers I’m getting.
He’s made a lot of people nervous, including some poor faggot who
thought he was going to be a movie star.</p>
<p><strong>burrows</strong>: We aren’t gonna arrest him for that…</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Big threat. TV would ream you.</p>
<p><strong>burrows</strong>: Keep me informed of what he’s up to. You
help me, I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>burrows</strong>: Why don’t people stay where they
belong?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You know what your problem is? You’re a very
negative person. You think negatively.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You have to believe in something. What do they
believe in – the Whatjamacillit church?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Christian Reformed. It’s a Dutch Calvinist
denomination.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in
reincarnation.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They believe in the ‘TULIP.’</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: What the crap?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s an anagram. It comes from the Canons of
Dort. Every letter stands for a different belief. T-U-L-I-P. Like – are
you sure you’re interested in this?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Yeah, yeah, go on.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: T stands for Total depravity, that is, all
men, through original sin, are totally evil and incapable of good. ‘All
my works are like filthy rags in the sight of the Lord.’</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Be that as it may. U is for Unconditional
Election. God has chosen a certain number of people to be saved, The
Elect, and He has chosen them from the beginning of time. L is for
Limited Atonement. Only a limited number will be atoned, will go to
Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I can stop if you want.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: No, please go on.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I is for Irresistible Grace. God’s grace
cannot be resisted or denied. And P is for the Perseverance of the
Saints. Once you are in Grace you cannot fall from the number of the
elect. And that’s the ‘TULIP.’</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Wait, wait. I’m trying to figure this out.
This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows
who you are?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: He has to. That’s Predestination. If God is
omniscient, if He knows everything – and He wouldn’t be God if He didn’t
– then He must have known, even before the creation of the world, the
names of those who would be saved.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: So it’s already worked out. The fix is in?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: More or less.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Wow. Then why be good? Either you’re saved or
you ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Out of gratitude for being chosen. That’s
where Grace comes in. God first chooses you, then allows you, by Grace,
to choose Him of your own free will.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You really believe all that?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah. Well, mostly.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: I thought I was fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’ll admit it’s confusing from the outside.
You’ve got to see it from the inside.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: If you see anything from the inside it makes
sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me
convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s not quite the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: It doesn’t make any sense to me.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Tod’ll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and
O’Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a ‘specialty’ customer.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why can’t I meet him now?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: I hope your prick falls off.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why can’t I meet him now?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Rot in hell, honey. He’s busy now.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where does he live.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Just a second. It’s my ass I’m risking. You
better do it my way. These fuckers don’t mess around.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I must have been in more motel rooms this week
than in the rest of my life. At least it feels that way.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: I know what you mean. After a while they all
look the same.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: They are the same.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Do you live in a house back in wherever.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Grand Rapids? Of course.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: On your own land?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Just you and your daughter?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Look, I really don’t know your daughter
but…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: I wouldn’t expect too much. I mean about her
coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What makes you so sure?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You wife isn’t dead is she?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Just a guess. She ain’t dead though is
she?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: She left you right?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah. She was the one called Joanne. How’d you
find that out?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Just a guess. Did you have it good with your
wife? You know, sex.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I don’t blame you, Niki. Really I don’t. It’s
this culture, where everything’s based on sex, sold on sex… …magazines,
music, TV. It’s destroying everything. Buy this ’cause of sex, use this
’cause of sex. Kids think it’s normal. They think they’re supposed to
talk dirty, wear scanty clothes…</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Don’t get upset. I lied too. I don’t make no
five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Granville?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: My man. ‘Pimp.’ I split ‘cause he don’t treat
me for shit. Thinks he’s so cool ’cause he’s black. I once tried to take
my clothes but he says, ’You can’t take ’em ’cause they’re my clothes –
I bought ’em.’ Yeah, with my fucking money…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Look, Niki, this really isn’t my business. I
don’t know anything about…</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: So I guess we’re both fucked, huh? But at
least you get to go to heaven. I don’t get shit.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: This is just how you found me once.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I felt like such a shit, pilgrim, after what I
did to you – not that I did anything wrong – that I kept investigating,
poking around. There’s some poor s.o.b. in L.A. with his face all bent
out of shape who you’ve damaged his movie career. Lucky for him, people
don’t look at his face.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Do the police want to arrest me?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Nah. They don’t care about some faggot
hustler. They’re more interested in your daughter’s health – and yours.
Like I am.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Listen, pilgrim, you’re way out on a limb
here. You don’t know what you’re into.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You sure as hell haven’t been any help.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: I’m sorry about that. Have you found anything
out? You’ve got to tell me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Why don’t you tell me something for a
change?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Who is Ratan?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Where’d you hear that name?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I just heard. Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: You know, it’s possible to buy anything on
this earth. You can buy child whores, slaves. You can have people raped,
killed… One of the men who supposedly arranges such things is named
Ratan. He usually isn’t in this country. How’d you hear about him?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: It’s just a name.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Don’t do anything more. I’ll find out what I
can.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Does she know anything about this?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Who? The whore? No. She’s just a victim. A
dime a dozen.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: Hey, Jake.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: I hear you got money to spend. I hear you’re
interested in… interesting things.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: Do you work for the San Francisco Police
Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law
enforcement agency?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: What you got in mind?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I want to meet Ratan.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: What is that? A kind of chair? I never heard of
no Ratan.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I was told that there were certain things that
only Ratan could provide.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: You’re talking about real excitement?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah. I heard you and Ratan just came from
Mexico. And that you had a film of a girl being, ah you know…</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: Who told you about this?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Rucker.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: I don’t know no Ratan, but I may be able to
help you out. It’s not me, of course. Just helping out a friend. It’ll
cost you five hundred bucks for a single screening.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Is this with a girl named Kristen?</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: Um-hm. You got the five hundred?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: Take it or leave it.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: Meet me here today at seven o’clock. With the
money. Then we’ll go see the film.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: You ain’t gonna ever have no thrill like
this.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: You know Granville’s looking for you,
Niki?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: My name ain’t Niki. It’s Pattica, like in
Attica.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Granville’s looking for you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: The guy who bought you that ring.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Well, he can just fuck himself.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Keep it, honey. You’re gonna need it. I know
that boy. He can make life real tough for a working girl. He’ll string
you out again.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You can fuck off, too.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: You’re taking a big chance.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: I ain’t ever gonna see him again anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Oh no? What you gonna do? Get a job?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Jake’ll take care of me.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Who? Van Dorn? You must be kidding yourself,
honey. You think once that guy finds his daughter he’ll care about
you?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Niki…</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: What happened, pilgrim?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Just leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: But I’m here to help you…</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Did you find out where she was?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Tod gave me the slip. I have to find him
again. Where does he live?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: I can’t tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Listen, Niki. My daughter’s been missing five
months. I’ve gone through a lot to find out what’s happened to her. I
just saw a girl killed. I will not let Tod slip out of my hands. You
have to tell me where he is.</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: But then you’ll forget about me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where is he, Niki?</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: Try a place called the House of Bondage. It’s
a plain black storefront next to Jane’s. There are some apartments in
back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I won’t forget you.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: What are you doing, pilgrim? Where are you
going?</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Let me take care of this. I don’t want you to
get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Don’t do anything until the police get there.
Don’t hurt that girl.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: You’ve got to tell me where he’s going.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Hello, police? My name’s Mast. Get me Joe
Klein in Vice.</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: You don’t know that man. He’ll hurt his own
fucking daughter. I’ve got to stop him. You know about Ratan, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: Hello. You want some information?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: We offer…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Yeah, yeah…</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: …the disciplines: bondage, domination and
humiliation.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I’m looking for Tod. Is he in?</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: I don’t know no Tod.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: What girls you got here?</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: My name is Hope. This is Faith. Charity’s in
back.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: That’s all you got, three girls?</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: Man, how many girls do you need?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I was told there was a real nice girl here
named Joanne. Quite young.</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: That’s Charity. She’s out back. She’ll be free
in half hour.</p>
<p><strong>hope</strong>: Tod!</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: What do you want? Do I know you from
somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I want to know where my daughter is. Her name
is Kristen, or Joanne. She’s with you.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: The police know about Ratan. They know he’s
here with you. They know everything.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: Oh, yeah? Goody for them.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: Get the fuck out of here.</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: You wait here. I’ll find out where she is.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: You ain’t goin’ nowhere alone.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Where’s Ratan?</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ratan!</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: That film was a fake! Everything’s phony…</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ratan!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: I know he’s here!</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Ratan!</p>
<p><strong>tod</strong>: Who the fuck knows? The Four Aces. He goes
there.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Halt!</p>
<p><strong>kristen</strong>: Don’t hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Come on, Kristen. Let’s go home.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: There’s another one. Tod. In the club.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Niki, maybe I can… There’s probably some way
to…</p>
<p><strong>niki</strong>: You got your daughter. I got my money. So now
fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: Andy, can you do something for her? Maybe
money…</p>
<p><strong>mast</strong>: Go home, pilgrim. There’s nothing you can do.
Forget this place. Start over.</p>
