<h1 id="the-power-of-one">the-power-of-one</h1>
<p><strong>purposes only</strong>: Copyright � 1990 Warner Bros.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: There comes a time in everyone’s life
when they discover that the only person you can truly depend on is
yourself. That the only real power anyone has to get anything done is
the power of one. With any luck you can make it through a lot of years
before you ever have to face the reality of that fact. It was a luxury I
never had. I discovered it the year my mother had her nervous
breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I was all of six.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: My father died before I was born, and
even though I was raised by my Zulu nanny, with my mother, depending on
her health, in nominal attendance, it was decided, with her departure,
that I, too, would depart… … for boarding school.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: But before I could be sent out into the
world one very serious matter had to be dealt with. I was a chronic
bedwetter. Since my nanny was the one responsible for my well-being, she
did what any responsible Zulu mother would do. She called on the
greatest medicine man of her tribe – Inkosi Inkosikazi.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Legend had it that Inkosi Inkosikazi was
the last son of the great Zulu king, Dingaan, who fought both the Boers
and the British to a standstill nearly 100 years before, and the night
Inkosi Inkosikazi was conceived stars fell from the sky until the sun
rose.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: The medicine man instructed me to jump
off the falls and climb along the ten stepping stones, counting as I
went until I reached dry land.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Even though it was only a dream, I felt
as if my struggle to reach dry land was terrifyingly real. The water was
like ice, bone- chilling, cold, and as I made my way from one stone to
the next I could feel my strength desert me.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I was three rocks in when I ran out of
gas. I couldn’t pull myself any further. No matter how hard I</p>
<p><strong>6 ext. farmyard - dawn 6</strong>: The fire has gone out. The
Boy is still sitting in the circle, the chicken still in his lap. His
eyes snap open. The first thing he sees is Inkosi Inkosikazi sitting
across from him with a big smile.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Inkosi Inkosikazi said the spirit of the
great Zulu warriors lived in me. He told me that whenever trouble arose
I should return to the waterfall and keep stepping across the rocks
until the trouble passed. He said three rocks were enough to conquer my
problem with the night water; that I was very brave. He said I was a man
for all Africa, bound to her by my spirit, bound by my dreams. And he
let me keep the chicken.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Although I was bound by spirit</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: The school I was sent to was attended and
staffed entirely by Afrikaaners, the oldest of the two white tribes of
Africa.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I spoke only English. The hated tongue.
The language of the enemy who had usurped power and stolen the country
through political chicanery and military brutality.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: During the Boer War of 1896, 26,000 Boer
women and children were herded into detainment camps by the British,
where they died like flies from dysentery,</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: And no one made this more evident to me
than Jaapie Botha, a wheat farmer’s son from the Transvaal.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: The only time I was at peace was when I
slept. Inkosi Inkosikazi’s chicken proved to be, like his previous
owner, a salvation.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: During the day he would live outside the
dorm, happily scarfing down bugs and grubs, secure in a little house I
built for him.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: And at night he would hop through the
window and, perching over my bed, squawking if any intruders came
near.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: He was my best and only friend.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I’m sure in time a status quo would have
been achieved between me and my schoolmates were it not for the
cataclysmic events occurring in that faraway place none of us had ever
seen. Two montjhs after I arrived at the school World War II broke out
in Europe. Hitler had vowed to crush the British Empire. The Boers
sharpened their swords in anticipation.</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: God has sent Hitler to deliver us from the
English bastards who stole our country and killed our people. Heil
Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: We will swear a blood oath. When Hitler
comes we’ll rise up and kill the Verdomde Rooineks.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: A blood oath! A blood oath!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: With your blood.</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: We swear allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Heil
Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: We swear allegiance to Adolf Hitler. Heil
Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: Death to all Englishmen in South Africa.
Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: God bless the fatherland. Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: See what we have in store for you when
Hitler comes, Rooinek. Hoy!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: For crimes committed against the whole Boer
people. I, Jaapie Botha, the judge and Uberfuhrer, sentence you and your
Rooinek kaffir chicken to death. Heil Hiter.!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Heil Hitler!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: Hang him up!</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Jaapie! No!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: Hang him!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: You will pay for the deaths of our
grandfathers and grandmothers, our aunts and uncles. All Rooineks will
pay and you will be first. Pull!</p>
<p><strong>jaapie</strong>: In the name of Adolf Hitler and the
fatherland, I sentence you to die, Verdomde Rooinek.</p>
<p><strong>boys</strong>: Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>staff member</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>20 int. st. john’s study - day 20</strong>: Prince of Wales
School, 1950. PK, 17 going on 18, well- built, intense, clear-eyed,
handsome, stands in front of a seminar and continues reading to 10
students, honor students, Headmaster St. John’s chosen few. St. John,
with the demeanor of an Oxford don and a mane of snowy white hair that
reaches his shoulders, sits off to the side, listening.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I came to after being unconscious for two days,
the rock missing my eye by half an inch. After a week in hospital it was
decided I’d be sent to my grandfather’s house in the English town of
Barberton, at least until passions at school cooled. Jaapie Botha was
expelled; sent home to his family’s farm in disgrace.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And so the first recorded South African casualty
of Hitler’s insanity was not a Boer, nor a Rooinek, but a
tatter-feathered, half-bald kaffir chicken.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Very evocative, yes. Particularly the
image of the chicken. Good choice there.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Any ideology that needs to attack the
thing that least threatens it is an ideology that will not outlive its
own generation. Inclusion, gentlemen, not exclusion, is the key to
survival. Something our new government should take heed of, eh?</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Next week we have Mr. Levy who will
enlighten us on…</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Sport and wager in Imperial Rome, sir.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Very apt, Mr. Levy. We look forward to the
experience. All right.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Well-written.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: I’ve received notice from the</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: A word of caution. Contemporary to most of
these fellows means the seventeenth century. Try and keep your theme,
um, classical, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes sir. I will. Will the scholarship be decided
at the same time, sir?</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Money’s a different matter. Different
committee.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Very good, sir.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: And P.K…</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Good luck tonight.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: How we doing?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You win and your dream comes true. You lose,
we’re back to bread and butter sandwiches till term’s end. What’d he
want?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: My appointement before the Oxford committee came
through.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: A snap.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: For a brain like you, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Come on, you’ll read one of your pieces,
they’ll be begging you to attend.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: But will they pay for the privilege?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Well let’s bloody hope so. It’ll be a lonely
time without you there.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Morrie Levy. Is that the voice of sentimentality
I hear coming from you?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Sentimentality my ass. Practicality. Where
am I going to find a sure thing like you to make book on at bloody
Oxford?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You hear Sutcliffe screwed Bartlett’s sister
when he stayed with them over holidays?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: I heard it from Bartlett’s own lips. He’s
selling reservations for next holiday. A pound for one night; three
pounds for four.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You register?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: For both of us. Took the whole holiday.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You nervous?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Christ! I’m about to have a calf. This
bloody Boer gets lucky, we’re in the poorhouse.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Now remember. We’re not here to exhibit our
wares. We go in, we do the job, we get out. Right?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And at the end of six matches in all
weight divisions, the score is Prince of Wales three victories,
Helpmakeer three victories.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And now for the final bout to determine
which school will win the Johannesburg 1950 public school boxing team
championship. In this corner, weighing 140 pounds, standing 5’8”, from
the Helpmakeer School with a record of 13-0 on the year, Jannie
Geildenhaus.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: And in this corner, representing the
Prince of Wales School, the current Johannesburg Public School
welterweight champion, also with a record of 13-0 on the year, also 140
pounds, Kid P.K.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: We thank the native population for their
spirited display of enthusiasm. But now, on to the main event. Fighters
to center ring, please.</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: You both know the rules. No butts, no
elbows, no low blows. First man to score three knock downs wins. Let’s
have a good clean fight. Good luck to you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: First row, third from the left. Find out who she
is.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: We’re in a bloody war here, in</p>
<p><strong>jannie</strong>: Blery Rooinek. I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Get up! Get up!</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Up! Up!</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: Okay. Fight.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: What are you trying to do, bankrupt us? What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Christ! If they get caught in here they’re
dead. What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Well, worry about it later. In case you
haven’t noticed, this Boer bastard is trying to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You see the way he drops his left when he throws
the right?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Thank you, God.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Here you go, pal.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You’re the treasurer of this company. You hold
it. Did you find out what I asked for?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thanks for the advice. The information
please.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Do you know who her father is? Professor
Daniel Marais.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: So? He’s the Nationalist Party’s resident
intellectual. The man is one of the architects of this damned system of
– what are they calling it? – apartheid? He has about as much use for a
Rooinek Englishman rutting after his daughter as the Queen does for
balls, pardon my French.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What’s her name and where do I find her?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Maria Elizabete Marais, Seniors Cottage,
Room 22, Devilliers School. They don’t call it ‘Fortress Virgin’ for
nothing. You’ll never get in.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You going to take book on that?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Already have. Three-to-one says you
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Where’d you bet?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: I took a big position you do.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: In case you have to bail yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>34 ext. school grounds 34</strong>: PK makes his way through
the darkened campus. A few stu- dents and some staff are about. PK hugs
the shadows as best he can. PK passes a statue dominating the quad – a
Boer family from the last century; the man looking for- ward, his gun
braced for action; the women and children at his shoulder, brave,
resolute.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Those are always cold. Use this one.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’m sorry to scare you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You can’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I didn’t know how else to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I could be expelled.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: We went on a dare. Please.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Did you like it?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: It was… … exciting. You were very good.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thank you. I’m glad I impressed you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You speak the Taal.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’ll speak Zulu if it’ll help me see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I need my father’s permission.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Is it hard to get?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Hard for an Afrikaaner boy. Impossible for an
English one.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: How about your permission? Do I have that?</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: We’re having coffee upstairs. Want to
come?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I have to finish this paper.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Come when you’re finished. We’ll be up
late.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Please go.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You didn’t answer my question.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: There are plenty of English girls. What makes
me so important?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: The way I felt when I saw you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: My father will insist on meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: Lights out, ladies.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Now please.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Good night, Maria Marais.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Good night, PK.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I don’t remember telling you my name.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: And I don’t remember telling you mine.</p>
<p><strong>39 int. marais house 39</strong>: An ample house. PAN ACROSS
a gallery of oil paintings depicting great moments in Boer history – the
Great Trek, an endless progression of oxcarts heading north, the Battle
of Blood River against the Zulu armies, the hang- ing of Boer farmers by
British regulars. Women and children herded into a detention camp as
their farms burn in the background. Boer kommandos sniping at a British
column on the veldt.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: Jan Piet Marais. My uncle. At 22 he led a
kommando for three years before your people caught him and hung him.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: My people?</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: The English.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I consider myself an African, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: As do I. As do the Zulu, the Xhosa, the
Pongo, the Ndebele. We’re all Africans. But all from separate tribes,
ay?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Because it’s the whole tribal idea that creates
our problems here in South Africa.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: The problems of South Africa, my boy, do not
come from tribalism. They come from counter-tribalism. From people
insisting that natural laws which have been in place and operating since
God’s creation, should be tampered with. Does the gazelle sleep with the
lion? Does the rhino graze with the mouse? The separation of things is
not coincidental. Do you think a Zulu wants to see his culture, his
sense of identity, replaced by someone else’s anymore than I do?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No, sir. But I don’t think he wants being a Zulu
to mean he is denied the same rights as everyone else has.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: Which is why civilization is defined by the
ability to live under the rule of law. Laws define rights.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: But do they define justice?</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: Ah. Justice. The banner behind which the
English marched as they gobbled up a quarter of the world? Justice, my
boy, is only relative to who’s in charge.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And how long they stay in charge is only
relative to how well they dispense that justice… … with all due
respect.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Papa, would you like coffee in the library or
the parlor?</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: The library, mein leib.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: I can’t figure out if you’re brave or
foolish.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Why is that, sir?</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: You come here to ask for permission to see
my daughter. Correct?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: And knowing who I am, what I stand for, do
you think this sort of discussion is going to put that request in a
favorable light?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I thought a man of your intellectual reputation
wouldn’t want his daughter seeing someone who didn’t think.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: Let me give you some advice then. You’re
right. I admire a keen mind. But intellectual reputation or not, I am
first a Marais, a member of the Volk.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: And if you’re trying to impress a member of
the Volk with your intellect, don’t do it espousing liberal ideas picked
up in an English private school.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: These ideas I picked up somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: No doubt from an expert on race
relations.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Actually, sir, from an expert on cactus.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Ja. Perfect. You will excuse me, please.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: This I do not normally without permission do,
ja? But to catch the expression. After all, it is the expression that is
important. Ja? Without the expression the human being is just a lump of
meat. You have some problems, I think. I am Professor Karl von
Vollensteen.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’m P.K.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Such a young person with such an</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: That was how I met Doc, as he insisted I call
him. A chance meeting between a directionless seven-year-old boy and an
old German professor out collecting cacti on the African bush veldt. So
began my education.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Doc believed the brain had two functions and
that the South African public school system unfortunately dealt with
only one.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The brain, P.K., has two functions. It is the
best reference library ever, which is a good thing to have. Ja? But also
from it comes original thought. In school you will get all filled up
with the facts. Here your brain will learn where to look, how to look,
how to think. And then you will have for yourself all the brains that
have ever been.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Doc knew everything. He had a love of learning.
But his real passion was centered around two things – music and
cacti.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Until he was fifty, Doc had a successful career
as a concert pianist all over Europe. On his fiftieth birthday he gave
it all up and moved to South Africa. From that point on it was all
cactus.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Every specimen Doc found would be carefully
photographed and catalogued.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: If God would choose a plant to represent Him, I
think He would choose of all plants the cactus. This one plant has all
the blessings He tried but failed to give man. It is true. Look. The
cactus is humble but not submissive. It grows where no other plant will
grow. The sun bakes its back, the wind rips it from cliffs, or drowns it
in the dry desert sand. Not a complaint. In good times or bad it will
still flower. It protects itself from danger.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: But it harms no other plant. It</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Doc was a hard man to disagree with. So when he
decided I must spend as much time with him to remedy the flaw in my
educational environment I didn’t argue.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Appealing to my grandfather’s stoic belief in
the primacy of European culture in all its forms, Doc offered to
instruct me in piano in return for my helping him locate and gather his
precious cacti.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: As a student of music I was never more than
adequate, something I suspect Doc knew from the start. It is the love of
music that is most important, he would tell me, and I would believe
him.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Everything fits, P.K. Nothing is unexplained.
Nature is one big chain reaction. Everything depends on everything else.
From the smallest to the biggest. Always in life an idea starts small
like a tree.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: This tree can grow so high it can touch the
face of the sky. But this little vine can choke it and keep it small.
Most people are like these vines. Afraid of new ideas. Afraid to let
things grow.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Always listen to yourself. Follow your own
idea. If you are wrong, so what? You learn something. And with learning
you grow stronger. And if you are right at the beginning? An even bigger
bonus.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I roamed the kloofs and ridges, the dry
riverbeds and jungle floors with Doc for over a year, learning more than
I realize even today. I also played a lot more ‘God Save the King’ due
to my new musical celebrity.</p>
<p><strong>48 ext. barberton - day 48</strong>: TRACK THROUGH Barberton,
a small town on the low veldt, in all its colonial backwater
splendor.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Barberton was a very proper English town with a
proper square, a wide main street, and the colonials’ overblown
patriotism for a homeland most people had never seen, hanging in the air
like fine dust. Not quite seen, but there nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>49 int. concert hall 49</strong>: PK plays “God Save the
King” on the stage. The town’s population stands – the men, stoic; the
women, dewey- eyed, at patriotic attention. Some people file out – the
men in officers’ uniforms of the South African penal system and their
wives – Boers. They exit to the dagger stares and some undertoned
hissing and booing from Her Majesty’s loyal subjects.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: The only Afrikaaners to live in Barberton were
sent there to work at the government prison, just outside town. Germany
had covertly supported the Boers in their two unsuccessful wars against
British rule, supplying food and medical supplies as well as ample
stocks of ammunition.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Germany was an old friend, a trusted friend. And
in a country where a handshake is a friendship and a friendship a bond
for life, as the war in Europe grew fiercer tensions in Barberton heated
up. Suspicion was afoot. Spies were everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Grammar: satisfactory. Science: satisfactory.
Mathetmatics: satisfactory.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: P.K., if there is one thing I know you to be
that is a lot more than just satisfactory. Ja?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: But I don’t want to be known as a brain.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Who do you think gets beaten up on all the time
in school?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: My boy, to be smart is not a sin. But to be
smart and not use it, that is sin number one. And as for getting beat up
on, use your brain to figure out how not to be.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Again it begins. The stupidity. Do not be
frightened.</p>
<p><strong>british officer</strong>: Karl von Vollensteen, for the
failure to register as an alien during times of war in accordance with
His Majesty’s government orders to do so, you are hereby sentenced to be
confined at Barberton prison for the duration of the war with
Germany.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And again I was alone with nothing to depend on
to see me through except the power of one.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Look, even if the scholarship doesn’t come
through, my old man said he’d lend you the money.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Morrie.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: All right. All right. We’ll call it the
‘Levy Carpet Emporium Scholarship for Poor but Proud Christian
Gentlemen.’ How’s that?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Tell your father I appreciate the offer.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: God, I hate people who can’t be bought.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: I don’t know. Personality disorder.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Undoubtedly.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: How do they get away with this?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: There he is.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Christ, he’s old.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And he’s the best. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: No, no. God gave you two hands so you can
knock a man out from either side. Left-right.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Mr. Goldman?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: What? You boys lost?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’m the one who called you yesterday. From the
Prince of Wales School?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Oh yeah, yeah. The champeen. Right?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: And who are you?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: The champeen’s manager.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Oy gevalt. You know you train here it’s not
like those nice school fights you’re used to. Three knockdowns you
win.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: What does it cost for you to train him?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: For my personal attentinons, Mr. Manager?
Fifty pounds a month. For one of them… … less.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Here’s for six months in advance. Three
hundred pounds.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Six months? I don’t know your boy’ll last six
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’ll last.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: That your gear?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Go change in the back. We’ll see if you
couldn’t find a better use for all that money.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Why’s he want to do this, a nice- looking
schoolboy?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: He wants to be welterweight champ of the
world.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Oh sure, sure. And I’d like to be twenty-five
again.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You like to make book on it?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: You giving odds?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You name them.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: You both meshugah.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Let’s just start out nice and easy now.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Never I seen someone so young throw an
eight-punch combination. Where did you learn such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: In prison, sir.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: You trying to be a comedian and a boxer?
Mr. Manager, come to my office. We’ll talk terms. You, get showered, and
see me after. We’ll talk training.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. von zyl’s office 59</strong>: The KOMMANDANT, a
brusque man with a salt-and-pepper brush cut sits behind his big
desk.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: So you are PK.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: I am Kommandant Von Zyl. The professor has
requested you to be his visitor so you can continue your studies on
piano and he can continue with his studies on cactus. This is the first
specimen?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir. Kalanchoe Thrysiflora.</p>
<p><strong>60 von zyl’s pov 60</strong>: A small cactus resting on some
tobacco leaves.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: The professor taught you this, ja? Of
course to your English town he is a prisoner, a criminal. To us who
respect such learning and culture, he is an honored guest.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: This pass is good for any time, any day.
Would you like to see him now?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: Come. I will take you myself.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: We have cleared a little plot behind the
cellblock for the cactus. And tomorrow we have the professor’s piano
moved here. There is not another instrument like it in the territory.
Maybe one day the two of you can give a concert for us, hey?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: You like to box?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I would like to learn, meneer. Are the boys
prisoners?</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: No, no. The sons of the guards. See that
one there?</p>
<p><strong>smit</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: We have room for one more on the squad?</p>
<p><strong>smit</strong>: He’s a little small, Kommandant.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: We’ll build him up then.</p>
<p><strong>smit</strong>: Yes, sir. But I really don’t have anyone to
spare to teach him right now. You know, with the tournament coming
up.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: There must be someone.</p>
<p><strong>smit</strong>: Piet.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>smit</strong>: You teach this boy basics, and you teach him
good or I knock your black head flat, you hear?</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: I teach him best I know, baas.</p>
<p><strong>smit</strong>: We train every day. First thing in the
morning. Miss two trainings, you’re gone.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, meneer.</p>
<p><strong>smit</strong>: Come tomorrow. See this old kaffir.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, meneer. Thank you, meneer.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: Lieutenant, a word?</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Don’t worry, little baas. Little can beat
big any day. First with the head, then with the heart. Little defeat big
when little is smart. You can remember that?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: No, no. Don’t never call me sir.
’Specially in front of the guards.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What should I call you?</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Piet. Geel Piet.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Kaffir. Towels.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Okay, baas. Coming, baas.</p>
<p><strong>66 angle on pk and maria 66</strong>: walking through the
carnival, munching popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You took a big chance talking to my father
the way you did.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Not really. Going in I was behind on points with
him. I’m English. I attend a politically suspect school. I’m a
boxer.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: He likes boxers.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: All men like boxers. But not for their
daughters. So I had to find some way to make an impression.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You could have picked a more agreeable
topic.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And made much less of an impression. Talk to
someone about their passion. Even if they disagree they’ll remember you.
It was really the most logical strategy if you think about it.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Do you spend hours thinking about how to deal
with me, too?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Days.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Know what I think?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: When I was little we would go to my
grandfather’s farm in the high veldt for holiday.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: My father would take me to the top of the
highest hill and we’d play this game, ‘What Do You See’ until we ran out
of things to see. Do you ever play that?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Want to try?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I see a forest. It goes on forever. There are
giant trees which keep getting bigger and bigger over thousands of
years. Now you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I see little trees growing on the forest floor,
learning to grow with the little bit of light the big trees let in. Now
you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I see the big trees getting bigger, their
leaves and branches making one great green umbrella over all of
Africa.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You tell a very good story.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Can’t hit you, can’t hurt you. Can’t hit
you, can’t hurt you. Can’t hit you, can’t hurt you. That’s it. Good.
Good.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: You wear out this old man. See? See how
it can work? How little beat big?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir. But when do I get to punch?</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: You not going to just punch, man. You
going to combination.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: One-two. One-two. C’mon. Now you.
One-two. One-two.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Oh do we have a boxer here. Yes sir. We
build you to eight-punch combination. The Geel Piet eight. Then you
catch afire. One-two. One-two.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: How is the next Joe Louis this morning?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Try and hit me.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No. Try hard.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You are amazing.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And I’m going to learn the Geel Piet eight.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yes, yes, yes. But right now you have to come
learn the Beethoven Fifth for one hour so we can get to the cactus
before it’s too hot to plant. Did you bring her?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Parchypodium Namquanium.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Excellent. Excellent. We make from you a
champion and a brain.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Excuse me, big baas. But can I talk to
the small baas?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Every day I see you bring the bucket and
in the bottom is some tobacco leaf.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: It keeps the roots wet.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: What happens to the leaf after?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: A little I use in some water to make a bug
spray for the plants.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And the rest we throw away.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: If you leave the pail when you go plant
is a problem, small baas?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Is like this. You see how hard the life
is for the people here in prison. Only little pleasure they take from
this hard life maybe sometimes when no one watching late at night – a
little smoke. Now with the big war in Europe tobacco is plenty hard to
get outside. Inside it is gone. We are the forgotten in here.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: We have bunches of leaves at home. I’ll bring a
whole bucketful tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: No, no. Mustn’t do that, little baas.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What Geel Piet means is it can be dangerous.
Something the guards might not want the people to have.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What’s wrong with tobacco? Why wouldn’t they
want them to have it?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What’s wrong is people whose job it is to
punish. After a little while it is all they know how to do.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: This is for you to answer.</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: I smell something not right here, ay,
kaffir?</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: No, meneer sergeant. Everything okay
here.</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: I don’t fuckin’ believe you.</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: If you’re up to something I’ll find
out.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Schweinhund.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: No, no. This old kaffir’s okay. Sorry to
make any trouble, little baas. We just stick to the boxing now on.
Sorry, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Geel Piet.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I leave my bucket on the side by Doc’s toilet
when I practice piano.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: PK, to me you are the champion of the world
already. Come. Let us go box now with Mr. Beethoven.</p>
<p><strong>68 int. solly’s gym 68</strong>: PK in the ring is about to
start sparring. Solly gives him instruction as Morrie stands by.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Now at the end of the Geel Piet eight you do
this… one-two… One-two-three… the Solly Goldman thirteen. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: That’s it. That’s it. Move him around. Jab
jab. Slip slip. Now.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: And… one-two… one-two-three.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: That’s it. That’s it. Now work around the
defense. Jab jab.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: How do you get away with this, Mr. G? Why
don’t they close you down? I mean, there are laws about blacks and white
boxing each other.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: In a public match. Not in a gym. Not yet
anyway. The Boer is a funny people. Outside the ring the black is not
equal. Inside he is. But only in private, not in public. So I keep my
mouth shut, the police go a little blind, and that’s that. It’s a crazy
world, huh?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Work him on the heavy bag.</p>
<p><strong>70 int. gym 70</strong>: PK pounds the heavy bag as Morrie
stands by.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Six, seven, eight, nine, ten. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Solly wants to see you two.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You wanted to see us, Mr. G.?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Close the door. Someone I got a lot of
respect for asked me to make a request. He wants to put you in a
match.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: With who?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: A young guy just turned pro. Gideon
Mandoma.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: A black fighter! They want him to fight a
black fighter?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: In a black township. Sofiatown.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Out of the question. Not even up for
discussion. C’mon, P.K.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Who asked you to ask?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: The man who promotes all the fights in
Sofiatown – Elias Nguni.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And you trust him?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: In thirty years I know him, number one on the
list.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You’re both out of your minds.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Did he tell you why he wants the match?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: I told you what he told me.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Just talking boxing – how do I match up with
Mandoma?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Pretty even.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: I mean besides getting thrown out of school
and into jail, do you know what else happens you do this? He’s a pro.
The minute you fight him you’re a pro.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: There’s no purse being offered.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: That’s a good career move. Risk everything
to gain nothing. Very sound business sense.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Tell Mr. Nguni I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Okay. What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Well why don’t you tell me what you do
know.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: There’s an African myth about an outsider who
comes one day and unites all the tribes into one against their
oppressors. They call it the myth of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi – the
tadpole angel. That chanting at the school championships?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: For you?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I haven’t heard it in years.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: And how did this honor fall on your broad
back?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I told you about bringing tobacco to the
prisoners at Barberton? Well after that was going for a while I learned
that even though they could send and receive letters, they never did.
They couldn’t read or write.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: So you did it for them.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: And after that?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: A clothing program for their families and a food
program. One thing sort of led to another.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: I can see where ‘angel’ would be an
appropriate title. But it was, uh, this Geel Piet who was really behind
all of it, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: He was very good at pointing things out.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Man like that should be running a country,
not rotting in prison.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: He’s not in prison anymore. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I thought I’d surprise you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Well, you succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Mr. Goldman was explaining the theory behind
the left hook.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Beats talking about the weather. You may
have heard about me?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh yes. How d’you do.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Well, nice meeting you, Maria.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Nice meeting you, Mr. Goldman.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: We never had a girl come to the gym. It’s not
such a bad thing, huh?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You got a pass to come out on a weeknight?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Your tree pass.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Do you box too, Morrie?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Do I look that daft?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Morrie’s the brains of the operation.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: He means the bank. Your boyfriend has a
great head for literature but none for finance.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I see you, Nguni.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: I see you, P.K.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: You have heard my request?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes. Why do you make it?</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: A woman has thrown the sacred ox bones. She
has made a fire and read the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What did she read?</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: That the Onoshobishobi Ingelosi who is a
chief must fight the one who one day will be a chief.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: But it’s not true that I’m a chief.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: Who knows what is true and what is not. The
legend of Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is very powerful among the people. They
see you box the Boer and always you win. They have heard the stories
from Barberton. The people live with little hope. They must see if the
spirit of the boy still lives in the man.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And if I lose? If the spirit of the
Onoshobishobi Ingelosi does not exist in me anymore, then what will they
live with?</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: Less hope. But still they must</p>
<p><strong>police #1</strong>: What’s this here?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: An old family servant, Officer. From home. We
just ran into each other.</p>
<p><strong>police #2</strong>: Papers, man. Come on, be quick.</p>
<p><strong>police #1</strong>: Where you coming from?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Gym, sir. I train there.</p>
<p><strong>police #1</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: I’m his manager.</p>
<p><strong>police #2</strong>: And you’re the sparring partner, hey?</p>
<p><strong>police #2</strong>: You have an hour to curfew and a long way
to go, kaffir. Be off.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: Yes, baas. Going right now.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’m scared for you, PK.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Solly’s a great teacher. He wouldn’t put me in a
fight I couldn’t handle.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I mean about how involved you are with the
black people. That scares me.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Because you don’t understand them.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: If you did you wouldn’t be so scared. You ever
have a conversation with a black person?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Besides a servant.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You should sometime.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I hate it when you tease me.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes I am.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I better go.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: According to your submission you have
ambitions to be a writer and the welterweight boxing champion of the
world.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Don’t you find seeking a career as a pugilist
and reading for a degree at Oxford a bit, how shall we put it,
intellectually</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Lord Byron was a boxer, sir. And I’ve never
heard anyone question his intellectual integrity.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: I do not recall Lord Byron actually engaging
in matches for money.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Actually, sir, there are several recorded
instances of Lord Byron engaging in matches for quite large sums of
money.</p>
<p><strong>examiner #2</strong>: Quite right. Yes. In a letter to his
wife Shelley makes mention of just such a thing. For hundreds of pounds,
actually.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Let’s move along, shall we? As your
presentational you’ve requested to read from a work of your own
fiction.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Well, then, let us hope we’ll be treated to
the stirrings of another Byron.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: The Concerto for the Southland and the Death of
Geel Piet. His name was Geel Piet – yellow Peter. He was a mix of half
the blood in Africa – Dutch, Portuguese, Zulu, Sotha, and who knew what
else. His father</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: When I met him he had spent forty of his
fifty-five years in one South African prison or another. He was a thief,
a con man, a black marketeer.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: He may even have killed a man or two in his
time. But despite all that he was one of the kindest, wisest, most
self-effacing persons I ever knew. He was my teacher; he was my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>81 int. prison room 81</strong>: PK sits opposite a black
prisoner who talks to him. PK, thirteen years old now, writes what the
man says on a piece of paper. When he is finished, he folds it, puts it
into an envelope, and hand it to the man. The man smiles, shakes PK’s
hand profusely, and exits. PK turns to Geel Piet who is on his hands and
knees polishing the floor, seemingly part of the surroundings. Geel Piet
and PK share a smile.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Geel Piet bore no animosity, held no hate.
Should a guard beat him he regarded it as self-inflicted,</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You know every time they do that I want to jump
up and say I’m just a twelve-year-old. I’m not anything else.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: To them you are. You are the one who
brings the smoke, the one who writes the letters, the one who puts
clothes on their children when they are cold. You are Onoshobishobi
Ingelosi.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: But you know that’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Who is to say what is true and what is
not true, kleine baas.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The Allied armies have crossed the Rhine into
Germany. It is almost over.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: That’s great, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You are a good faker, Geel Piet. but you don’t
think it’s great at all. It means you lose your star letter writer and
tobacco importer.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: No matter that, Professor. We always
manage here. What pains me most is I lose my boxer.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’ll come back.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: No, kleine baas. You leave this damn
place you don’t come back never.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Geel Piet, when a painter finishes a work of
art he doesn’t lose it. He sends it out in the world so everyone can see
the genius of his creation. This is what you are going to do. And to
celebrate the launch of such a work of art as you have made our boxer
here, I have composed an entire concerto – ‘The Concerto for the
Southland’ – which it is my intention to play in concert for the
prisoners before I leave.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: Not possible. The kommandant never allow
the people to have such a thing.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He’ll think it’s a concert for him and the
brass. But we’ll know, ay? And the people will know.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: He’ll never let black be with white here,
Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: If the black is part of the</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: But the people have no instruments in
this place, big baas.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: They have their voices. Each tribe a different
voice, a different language – all singing together. It is brilliant,
no?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Except the tribes don’t trust each other. They
don’t even talk to each other.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Oh. This is correct. This stupid hatred.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: They will do it for you, kleine baas. You
are Onoshobishobi Ingelosi. You bring the tobacco. You write the
letters. You put clothes on their children’s bodies and food in their
bellies. All you do is ask and they all sing for you.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He’s right. Wunderbar. You are the smartest of
us all.</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: A kaffir smarter than all of us? You are a
strange German, Professor.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That little maniac with the moustache in Berlin
you admire. He is the strange German. And soon kaput, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: If that’s true you’ll not be long for this
place, eh, Professor?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No, Sergeant. God willing.</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: And you, too, little Rooinek. But you,
kaffir, Hitler comes or goes…</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: You are going to stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: And I will find out all your secrets once
your friends are gone. One slip…</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: I have you.</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>bormann</strong>: You see, Professor, they are not like us. A
white man would scream bloody murder.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: As the weeks went by and the date for the
concert grew closer, my life was a whirlwind.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Having obtained the cooperation of all the
tribal groups, we set about instructing them. Four men from each tribe
were taught the</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: At night the prison hummed with the men in their
cells practicing.</p>
<p><strong>p.k.</strong>: My boxing instruction accelerated as well. It
was as if Geel Piet was trying to give me every bit of boxing knowledge
he had before we parted. And always from the corners and shadows Bormann
watched and waited.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Our boxing squad, the Barberton Blues, won the
State Championship with a perfect record. I won at 100 lbs. It was my
first championship. It made me want</p>
<p><strong>86 int. prison yard - night 86</strong>: The guards, all in
crisp uniforms, patrol nervously, truncheons at the ready. The towers
bristle with guns as hundreds of black prisoners file into the yard.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Finally the night of the concert arrived. The
prison atmosphere, normally tense, was keening. Each prisoner entering
the yard is searched. It was prison policy to keep tribal rivalries
boiling. Divide and conquer. The policy of control.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: This was to be the first time in the history of
the South African prison system that the tribes were allowed to mingle.
And if trouble came, it would be the last.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Have you seen my page turner?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Have you seen Geel Piet?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: He will come.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: Where is Bormann? I need Bormann to
translate to the prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>smit</strong>: I don’t know, Kommandant.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Is there a problem here, Kommandant?</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: I want to address these filthy kaffirs but
I don’t have a translator.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’ll translate.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: You can speak Zulu, PK?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: All right. Listen up.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: Tell them this concert is the gift to them
from the professor who, even though he is in prison, is not a dirty
criminal like them but a man of culture and learning.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: The Kommandant welcomes you and looks forward to
the great singing.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: For such a man I am happy to do this. But
one hair of trouble and it’s finish.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: He hopes each tribe will sing its best and bring
honor to its people.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: One wrong move and you get marched back to
your cells and don’t come out for a month.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: He says tonight let us be one people under the
African sky.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: You did a good job.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: Professor?</p>
<p><strong>89 back to scene 89</strong>: PK is caught short by the
flash. He falters a bit, then regains his concentration.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Geel Piet died of massive internal hemorrhage,
the result of Bormann’s ramming a truncheon up into the little man’s
body until his entrails spilled out. When I reached him he was already
dead. I sat there crying, stroking his head and crying with African</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Thank you very much. You will be notified as
to the University’s decision by mail.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Point of curiousity.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Your headmaster told me your work is somewhat
autobiographical.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: This Bormann, he was real?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lewis</strong>: Was justice ever served?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir. Sergeant Bormann died of cancer… of
the rectum.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: We have to make a stop first.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: The night won’t last forever, boychick.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: It’ll only take a minute.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: The night I escaped from the Tsar’s Army it
was just like this. Six of us – four Jews, two Ukranians. Dark as
anything. No streets. In the day we hid in bushes. At night we went.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You deserted?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Whey they come take you at thirteen years old
and tell you it’s twenty-five years in the Army, it’s your duty to
desert.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: You said the end of the road.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: Yes, yes. Sorry. I drive.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: Welcome, miss, welcome.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>101 int. car 101</strong>: The car bounces along the rutted
darkened streets of the township. The glow of smoldering cooking fires
through open doorways offers minimal illumination to the squalid lives
within. Maria peers out at a world she has never seen. As the car
drives, women and children gather along the road peering in. Mothers
point to PK, instructing their children.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: The people have come from everywhere to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Where are the men?</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: They are to be witness.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: No worry, miss. It is the sound of
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: We are here.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: I don’t see why we have to weigh in. They’re
going to fight anyway.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: It is very important the people see
everything is correct.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I see you, Gideon Mandoma.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: I see you, PK.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I just want you to know you fight a man.
Onoshobishobi Ingelosi is just a name I was given at Barberton Prison.
It means nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: It is not for you or me to say what it
means.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>nguni</strong>: It is time.</p>
<p><strong>whispers</strong>: Onoshobishobi.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Onoshobishopi Ingelosi. Shobi shobi
Ingelosi.</p>
<p><strong>old woman</strong>: Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: You are listening to me please. When I am
shouting break, you must break at once. When a knockdown is coming, it
is for an eight count. No heads, no elbows. You fight clean or by golly
I am giving you penalty points. Good luck, boys.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: A very tough fight.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Watch the left hook.</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: Continue.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: God, he hits like a truck.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: He’s going for the quick knockout. He can’t
keep it up. Soon the truck runs out of gas.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: If he catches me again like that I’ll run out of
gas – permanently.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: He’s had it. He’s got no strength in his
punch.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Could’ve fooled me.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: I’m telling you.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Look – he’s taking water.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: See. Where that water goes – you go. Right to
here.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: You put your punches there, you win. You
don’t, you lose.</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: Three… four… five…</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: … seven… eight… nine…</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: How many fingers?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Six.</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: In a fight behind on points.</p>
<p><strong>referee</strong>: Okay. Continue.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: We’re in the shit now. Nice knowing you,
Solly.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: Onoshobishobi Ingelosi.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: The Seniors Dance is two Saturdays from now.
I would like it if you could escort me.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Maria Marais with a rooinek at the Senior Dance?
What will people think?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: They’ll think what they think and I’ll think
what I think.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And what is that?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I think I love you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I would be honored to be your escort.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I didn’t doubt it for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’ll give you a boost.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Thank you for tonight. You were great.</p>
<p><strong>113 int. car 113</strong>: Morrie is sleeping in the back
seat. Solly and PK are sitting in the front.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: When you and your manager first came to me
with that meshuganah idea to be welterweight champion of the world you
did not have a big believer here. But I gotta tell you. Now you do. In
London lives Benny Rosen, the greatest trainer in the world today. When
you go to your Oxford I give you a letter to Rosen. Whatever I can’t do
for you, he can.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thanks, Mr. G.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: And I give the address of a very good
bookmaker. Teach you also a thing or two. Now, go on back to being
fancy-schmancy English gentlemen. I’m proud of both of you.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You’re up early, sir.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Best time for walking.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Best time for running too, sir.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Have to put in the roadwork, sir. You know,
keep those legs strong.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Yes. Quite a fresh bruise there.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I tripped.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Maybe you should change your footwear.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: To something a little more appropriate
for… roadwork.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: Please excuse me for coming like a thief by
the window.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You speak English?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You are a great fighter, Gideon.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: Second greatest in this room.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: But you didn’t come to talk about fighting.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: When you say to me, Onoshobishobi Ingelosi
means nothing, you are right. And you are wrong. The legend gives the
people hope for a good tomorrow. But hope alone will not make a good
tomorrow for the people. You cannot write our letters, get us clothes,
food, work. These things we must do ourselves, so we can be part of this
country’s good tomorrow. If we are not, the hope will disappear. The
people will grow tired. The tired will grow angry and there will be no
good tomorrow for anybody – black or white.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What are you asking from me?</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: To be part of something you must know what
everyone else knows. We have our own knowledge. We need yours.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: We get our knowledge in schools, Gideon.
We’re not born with it.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: Then it must be the same with us.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You have schools.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: Yes. And teachers who cannot do more than
their own ABC’s. We have a system made not to teach us.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I am only seventeen years old, Gideon. I cannot
teach five million people how to speak English and do sums.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: You taught the singing to thousands at
Barberton Prison. You were only twelve.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: You are a great fighter, PK.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Second greatest in this room, Gideon.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: You are asking me for a lot, young
man.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’m only asking you to put what you’ve taught us
into practice, sir.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: You are asking me to put the reputation of
this school in jeopardy.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: The reputation of this school, sir, is based on
its integrity.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: I’m aware of that. I’m also aware of what
will happen if this ever gets out. We live in a country where the rules
are being rewritten.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Then we’d better be careful to keep a firm hand
on our pens… … sir.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: All right. I will allow it on a trial
basis. Here are my conditions: you tell no one; you operate at night on
Saturdays when the student body is gone; you involve no one besides
yourself and Mr. Levy. If you can comply, you can have your school.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Ready. Set. Go!</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You’re supposed to let me win.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Then you’d say I was being condescending.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You were guilty of that when you gave me a
head start.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Get your formal yet?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Uh… no.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: The dance is only a week away.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Maria… I can’t come to the dance.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I have an obligation.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Can’t you change it?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: It’s a permanent obligation. Every Saturday
night… It starts tonight.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You’re breaking up with me.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Then what could be so important that it takes
all your Saturday nights?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I really can’t say.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’m not going away.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Yes you are. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’m not. I’m just tutoring.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I started a school… … for Gideon Mandoma and
some others in the seniors library.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’m losing you to a bunch of kaffirs?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You’re not losing anything.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No? Are you escorting me to the dance? Are
you going to see me on the only free night they give us?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Maria, this is important to me.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: And my life’s important to me. Damn you.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Ach. You see how beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You ever hear of glycerine, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Mr. Going-To-Oxford-Smarty-Pants. Of course I
know about glycerine. Triglycerine. Biglycerine. Monoglycerine. What do
you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Why you don’t use it. It’s only a little pill
under the tongue.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Tongues were not made to put little pills
under. When I have to start with that, I become something else.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Well, until you become something else, the
little pills would make this easier on your heart.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Little pills or no little pills – we don’t find
cover, we both turn into something else.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Look for a cave. Always in this kind of rock
there is caves. Quick! Quick!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Don’t look at me. Go!</p>
<p><strong>119 his pov - opening 119</strong>: some 20 yards ahead.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’ve found something.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Exploring.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Why don’t you just rest?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Plenty time for resting when I am something
else. Look.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: When does a cave have wind? This</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Here. See? There is a passage.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You know the pyramids are nothing more than
man’s attempt to recreate the first safe home our species had – the
cave. It is the ultimate safe resting place. The first place man could
lay down and have a good night’s sleep without worrying about waking up
as something’s supper.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You hear that? There is something waiting for
us.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Let’s hope it’s not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Better, ja?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Maybe it’s stopped raining.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Who can think about rain when you are on the
edge of the great unknown cave.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The bats didn’t come from a shoebox,
Mr. Know-It-All.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Sometimes I think maybe sending you off to that
fancy-shmancy school was not such a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: It was your idea. Your’e the one who pushed for
me to go.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Ja. But who knew they do such a good job of
boxing up part of</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Which part is that?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The one where is all the questions. The
curiosity center. Look.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Did I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Wunderbar.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: How many hundreds of thousands of years to make
this masterpiece? Everything outside can change, P.K. This remains the
same. We are in the heart of Africa, P.K. The heart of Africa.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You know, if a person stayed here for 100,000
years what would be</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Incredible.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I wish we had brought the camera. Think there’s
enough light to shoot?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Doc?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Doc?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: This is not funny.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: This is incredible! The crystal. You can feel
the life go right through you. Here.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Come try it.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No. That’s all right. Can we go?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We have only just gotten here. What’s the
matter, P.K.?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: All day long you’ve been talking about becoming
something else, about dying. You never talked about dying before.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m 87 next month. It’s natural.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Not to a sixteen-year-old it’s not. It’s
painful.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You are right. I am sorry. Sixteen-year-old
ears should only hear life.</p>
<p><strong>129 int. doc’s house - night 129</strong>: PK and a very
exhausted Doc enter. Doc sits down heavily on the bed while PK,
shrugging off his rucksack, heads right for the small kitchen area.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’ll just set you up with some coffee here, so
in the morning you won’t have to bother making it.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I didn’t mean to tell you what</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: … becoming… … something else. I know it’s
natural law and it’s the way it is with everybody… I just wish it
weren’t with you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Doc?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’m here, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The crystal cave will be our secret, ja?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Promise.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Ja. Good. I rest a little. The heart of Africa,
P.K.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The heart.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Christ! If someone would have told me this
is where I’d be on a Saturday night, last term of my senior year, I’d
call them batty. You know, you’re going to owe me for the rest of your
life on this one.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: That all? I figured you’d hold me to it
longer.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You get the insider friend’s rate.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thanks, mate.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: I see you, P.K.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I see you, Gideon.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Let’s get inside before the whole bloody
world sees us.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: Morrie.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: You some great friend.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Let’s go. Stay to the fence.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: All right, class. I know you don’t understand a
word I’m saying, but part of learning a language is hearing it spoken.
So – I am P.K.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: P.K. This… … is Morrie. Now you all have a
chalkboard.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Chalk and an eraser. I will say</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Morrie will check the letter. All right? Here we
go. ‘A’… … say it. ‘A.’</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I thought you might need some help. Or I can
just sit and watch.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Class. This is Maria. She is now the teacher.
We’re doing alphabet, from the letter ‘A.’</p>
<p><strong>134 her pov - black faces 134</strong>: before her, watching
intensely.</p>
<p><strong>135 back to scene 135</strong>: She battles the butterflies
in her stomach as she writes an “A” on the blackboard. She clears her
throat.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Repeat what she says. Say it again.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: ‘A.’ Write ‘A.’</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: You are one brave Boer, Miss Maria.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: And you are one lucky English.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Good night, Gideon.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Well, I think I’ll go… um… lay on my back
and count the cracks in the ceiling. ’Night. Nice to see you, Maria.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Good night, Morrie.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I am one lucky English.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: P.K. Can I ask you a favor?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Anything.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: We don’t have to go in or anything. You can
hear the music from outside. I’d love to have one dance with you before
I graduate.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I feel so good. Race you to the gate.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You need a headstart?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: We made it! We made it!</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Sorry. I couldn’t bear the suspense after I
read mine. I had to open it.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Three months and we’re out of here.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You’re out of here.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: What the hell are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: ‘Dear sir. It is our pleasure to inform you
that you have been accepted to matriculate at Trinity College, Oxford,’
etc., etc., etc.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: It says nothing about the scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: A technicality.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: St. John wants to see you two in his study.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Good news travels fast.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’ll get showered and changed.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: He said to come as you are. Immediately.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Wanted to see us, sir?</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Yes. Come in. Close the door.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: This is Brigadier Bretyn from the police
department.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: He has come to deliver, in person, an
order to close the Saturday school.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: Because it is illegal.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: We’re only teaching them how to read and do
sums.</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: You don’t have certification to do that.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Prince of Wales is a certified school.</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: Yes. But not certified for that</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Can he do this, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: Of course I can do it. Would I be here if I
couldn’t? Come now meneer headmaster. Let’s end this now. I have a full
day ahead of me still.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: The Saturday school is to be disbanded
until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: Thank you, meneer headmaster. Your
cooperation in this matter is very appreciated. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You know it can’t go on like this forever.</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: What can’t?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: I’m just doing my job. And if you’ll take
some advice, you should just do yours.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Is that really the end of it, sir?</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: For the moment I’m afraid it is.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: If we let them get away with it on our own
grounds, it will never</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: History disputes you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: History takes too long.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Yes it does. But it is never kind to those
who try to hurry it.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I feel we should resist, sir.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: So do I, P.K. But this is not a subtle
government. They mean to have their way and damn the consequences. And I
cannot jeopardize this school, no matter how I personally feel. I’m
sorry. I heard you were accepted at Oxford.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Yes, sir. Received notification today.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: Well, congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: To both of you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: We’ll talk before you go.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yes, sir. Will that be all?</p>
<p><strong>st. john</strong>: That’ll be all.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’d like to see Maria Marais please.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry. She’s not allowed visitors.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Well, if I could just talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Morrie. Morrie.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Can I see it later?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You know, when we get to Oxford – separate
rooms.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Will you hurry.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Is there some girl out there waiting for
me?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Yeah. Stunning. Breasts like casabas. Just
waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: I think you’re fooling yourself into
thinking the bastards won’t</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: This is a church. Didn’t you ever hear of the
Christian concept of sanctuary?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Yes. But I’m not the one who has to respect
it.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Even the Boer has limits, Morrie.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: I’m sure he does, but I’d still like to see
a big bolt on the inside door.</p>
<p><strong>caretaker</strong>: Mr. Levy?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Now move it nice and easy, the both of you.
Time.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: They want us to close the school.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: We are still game.</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: So are we.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Would you two find some other time to chat.
This is a boxing ring, not a social club.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I was in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>149 int. room 149</strong>: Maria points to the door.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: They’re sending me away to school in
Pretoria. I told my father I wouldn’t go. He said if I didn’t he’d see
they arrest you and ruin your chances. I couldn’t let him do that.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: When do you go?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Next week. I want to make love to you,
P.K.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>152 ext. school grounds - night 152</strong>: PK and Morrie
stand by a side gate near the athletic field looking alertly about. The
gate opens. The Africans led by Mandoma come through. PK and Morrie
greet them. When they are all through Morrie closes the gate and runs
after them.</p>
<p><strong>153 ext. athletic field - stands 153</strong>: A man with a
walkie-talkie sits in the shadows, watching 25 people run across the
athletic field. He talks into his walkie-talkie.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: If you’ll all be seated we can begin.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: So far so good.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I want to thank you all for having the courage
to come tonight. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I will be teaching the first part of class
tonight and Mr. Levy will teach the second.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Gideon?</p>
<p><strong>mandoma</strong>: Miss Marais. Will she not be coming?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: See.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I see. You see. We see.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: I see. You see. We see.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Boy.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: Boy.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I see the boy.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: I see the boy.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Girl. I see the girl.</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: I see the girl.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: P.K., it’s me.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I wanted to say goodbye to my students… … and
to you.</p>
<p><strong>women</strong>: We see the girl.</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: Once warned. Twice punished.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You’re violating the sanctity of the church.</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: No. You are with your damned race mixing
ideas, rooinek.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: At least let the women go.</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: You want everything to be equal, little
Boetie. Why not men and women too?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: Locks keep people out but they also keep
them in.</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: Get up, you bloody commie Jew!</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: Captain.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No. Wait. We’ll leave.</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: Too late. You never should have come. At the
ready.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>bretyn</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Maria!</p>
<p><strong>men</strong>: Daniel. No.</p>
<p><strong>159 ext. cemetery wall 159</strong>: Thousands of Africans
and a smattering of whites have gathered outside the cemetery. The
singing rises from them.</p>
<p><strong>160 ext. cemetery 160</strong>: Marais glares at PK, tears of
rage in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: In case the scholarship doesn’t come
through.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Why are you so bloody stubborn? You don’t
belong in a South African university any more than I belong in the
priesthood. Will you take my father’s loan?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: There a Mr. P.K. here?</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: It’s your scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Sign here. Odd name – P.K.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Waldo.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: You’re not one to talk about names.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Doc’s missing.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: Since his pneumonia last year I’ve had one
of the men drop by once a week to see if he needed anything. Of course
you know the professor. He never did.</p>
<p><strong>von zyl</strong>: At the beginning of the week he wasn’t home
so I decided to drop by myself. Waited a whole day here. When he didn’t
come back I sent search parties. After three days I sent the telegram.
Seven days is a long time for him to be gone. Do you have any ideas
where he went?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: So Mr. Schmartypants. It did not take you so
long to figure out what happened. I hope you forgive me for not saying
goodbye, but I did not think it would be necessary between us. What
could I say you don’t already know.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: That I love you with all my heart? That you
have given me more in our ten years of friendship than three lifetimes
could fill? That the last thoughts I have before becoming something else
will be of music, cactus, and you? You know all this.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Last night this music came into my head. It is
my music for Africa. My music for you. So go. Be welterweight champion
of the world. Be a writer. A great writer. Remember – the only thing
between a dream and a reality is you. Until we meet again, your friend,
Doc.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Hello? Mr. G? Anyone here?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: In here.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Mr. Goldman, why isn’t anybody</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: A repeat performance of history, my boy.
Solly Goldman’s being deported. Of course last time I didn’t have the
luxury of being able to pack.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: For what reason?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: Their reason is that I’m here illegal. I
didn’t enter the country with a passport. Like the Czar was issuing
passports to Russian Jews in 1910.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: This is because of me, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: No, boychick. This is because of them. They
are the problem, not you. Don’t ever think different. You look tired.
Want a glass tea?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No, no. I have to get back to school.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: You got your head screwed on right. Don’t let
these meshuganahs screw it on wrong. Now go on. You want to find me,
look at Benny Rosen’s gym in East End, London.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thank you for everything.</p>
<p><strong>solly</strong>: We’re not finished yet.</p>
<p><strong>174 int. pk’s dorm 174</strong>: PK hurries down the hall to
his room. He opens the door to Daniel Marais, sitting at his desk,
reading from his fiction-filled notebook.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: You’re a very good writer. The subject
matter is a little inflammatory but the style is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: I came to inform you that you will not be
receiving aid from the National Scholarship Fund. Neither will you be
admitted to any of the South African universities. Here are your
applications back.</p>
<p><strong>marais</strong>: I told you when you came to my house. I am
first a member of my tribe and I will defend it any way I know how.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: They don’t want you here any more than they
want me.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Take the hint. Screw the scholarship. Come
on. Let’s leave.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: If I leave or if I stay in South Africa it’s
because I choose to, not because they choose for me.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Save my place at Oxford.</p>
<p><strong>morrie</strong>: P.K., goddammit!</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Save my place.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Dear Morrie. Here is how it works.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Setting charges and drilling the rock. The only
way for the raw ore he takes from the sides of the stope to get to the
haulage below is to pass through the spout of a funnel and out the steel
doors at the bottom – sixty feet down.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Halfway down the spout area is a set of six
tungsten steel bars called a grizzly which catch all the rocks too large
to make it through the funnel mouth to safe haulage.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: These are taken care of by a grizzly, an
explosives expert whose job it is to keep the ore flowing, and since
when the ore doesn’t flow, neither does the money, working the grizzly
is a very crucial and therefore very well-paid position. Three
months’</p>
<p><strong>181 int. miner’s bar 181</strong>: A crude place where the
bar runs the back length of the room and the bare concrete surroundings
offer nothing in the way of diversion from the main purpose of being
there – to drink hard and long.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Are you crazy? To sign on for a year?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You said I was the best you ever taught,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: And you are, boyo. The absolute best.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: But even the best doesn’t survive a year on
the bars. Down in that damn tube the luck runs out sooner than later.
You may be a genius at reading the rock but you ain’t no fuckin’ fortune
teller.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You worked grizzly a year.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: And let me show you what I have to show for
it to this day.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: And that’s thirteen years after the fact,
boyo.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: One double brandy. One… lemon soda.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Come on, then.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: On being the best damned blaster ever taught
by Ian Thomas. Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Another.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Sure you don’t want one?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I don’t like the taste.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Taste? You don’t drink for the taste.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Hell’s comin’.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Drillers. He’s got a powder pain from
breathin’ too much of that damn gelignite. The pain’s bad enough. Mixed
with a little alcohol it’s fuckin’ lethal.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: Come on. We ain’t got much time.</p>
<p><strong>thomas</strong>: The two most dangerous things you’ll ever
see in your life, boyo: a hangup of rock that won’t blast free on first
shot and a driller with a powder headache drinkin’.</p>
<p><strong>183 ext. camp - night 183</strong>: A company-built miner’s
camp. Cement huts with steel doors and corrugated roofs. No shrubbery,
only dust, cement, and the roughest-looking bunch of men assembled on
earth.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Dear Morrie. To answer your question: yes–sports
are played here, but only in the loosest sense of the words “sport” and
“play”. The rules are different for everything, in games as well as in
the rest of our lives. The managers, the foremen, the company people.
They live apart from the miners. They have families. Proper gardens.
Sunday dinners. The miners–the crud, as we are called – don’t. This is a
society of men, many of whom have pasts better left behind. Future does
not apply. It is a society only in the loosest sense of the word. The
laws of survival are simple– you either do or you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: You know, Rasputin, I had them right where I
wanted them. Another minute they were done for.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Friendships are rare–arising out of mutual need
rather than</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: The Africans who come here looking for work are
driven by a different desperation–drought, famine, locusts.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: They come and risk their lives to send money
back home to the families sitting on the barren farms, starving, waiting
for death or rain.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Superstition runs deep in them, so a good
grizzly man attracts a good crew. On the bars, the longer you live the
luckier you are. And by association – they are.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Baas. Baas.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Hangups are the worst of it. When the top of the
funnel gets blocked up and the ore won’t flow.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: The only way to unblock it is to set a charge to
blow inward. And the only way to do that is to set the charge in mud,
which means climbing up to the mouth of the stope and coming
face-to-face with the devil.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Sometimes the rock doesn’t need the provocation
of explosives. Sometimes the earth shifts… a pebble moves… you talk too
loud… and in the moment before you are turned into something else by
fifty tons of rock you understand why it is called grizzly.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I wait for you, baas.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Let’s clean her off and call it a night,
hey?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: The Africans think the longer you survive the
luckier you are. And the luckier you are the longer you survive. I know
there’s something inherently wrong with their logic. Still, I’m
beginning to see their point. Especially with less than six months to
go.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Ay, man. If you’d let him win once in a while
we could take a little book on it here.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: He doesn’t care if he wins. He just likes to
play.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I like to win.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Which is why I’m about visiting you. You’ve
come on the board, man. There are odds on your making it or not.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: How are they?</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Not in your favor, my boy.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Why are you telling me this, Jocko?</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: When you come up on the boards, boyo, it’s
time to bow out. It’s an omen.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I bow out you can’t make book.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: PK, it’s not a bet I want to collect.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Tell me, Jocko, how high will the odds go on
something like this?</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: The shorter your time, the higher they go.
With you probably ten, twelve, thirteen to one when you’re short a
month.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: When the odds hit the top put me in against all
bets for two hundred quid.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: I did not come here to solicit your bet.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I know that. I appreciate it. But if you don’t
take it, someone else will.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: All right. You’re a bleery fool. And I’ll be
prayin’ every night it’s the only bet I ever have to pay off on.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: And so will I.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: You should let him win once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: When he wins it won’t be because I let him.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Checkmate.</p>
<p><strong>193 int. mine elevator 193</strong>: The elevator descends
into the shaft. PK and his crew exit. There is a low sound of a blast,
muffled, that stops them all.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Did you hear a blast whistle?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: No, baas.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I never heard a drill at night.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: It’s not a ghost. It’s just some driller trying
to squeeze extra pay. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Baas.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Not the first bloody thing!</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: Bad sign, baas.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Bad drilling’s more like it. Come on. Let’s get
it going.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What’s the matter with them?</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: They say juju. Bad magic is in the mine
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>196 pk 196</strong>: making it down the side of the
tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>197 the africans 197</strong>: peeking out of the safety
tunnel, scared.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: She’s playing with us tonight. Fuse set?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>elijah</strong>: I stay with you, baas.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: That’s an order.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: One… two… three.</p>
<p><strong>miner #1</strong>: He’s dead. No doubt about it.</p>
<p><strong>miner #2</strong>: You give me a fair odds on ten quid?</p>
<p><strong>miner #1</strong>: Four to one.</p>
<p><strong>miner #2</strong>: Make it a sixer and you got me.</p>
<p><strong>miner #1</strong>: You’re on.</p>
<p><strong>miner #2</strong>: Anyone else? Six to one he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>miner #3</strong>: He says someone was up there. Blasted it
out on PK from the other side?</p>
<p><strong>miner #4</strong>: Who’s the driller?</p>
<p><strong>miner #3</strong>: Botha.</p>
<p><strong>miner #4</strong>: No one drills Botha’s stope but Botha, and
he only works days.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Help. Help.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Help.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Well, look at ya now, boyo. Up and at ‘em in
no time. And rich as a fuckin’ lord.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Your ticket to ride. Two hundred quid at
fourteen to one.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: But I didn’t make it. I’m a month short.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Not according to managment. They cashed you
out at twelve months for eleven worked. Last thirty days was bonus. And
until someone shows me a calendar reads different, twelve months and a
year are one and the same kind of thing. And the bet was for a year. So
get yourself mended and get your ass out of here.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: There’s someone I have to see first.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: What do you want to go pressin’ it for?
You’re rich, lad. You’re whole. Why do you want to go pressin’ it?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Because I want to know.</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: Know what? That the man has</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No worries. The luckier you are, the longer you
last. The longer you last, the luckier you are.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: Checkmate! Checkmate!</p>
<p><strong>jocko</strong>: There’s an end to everything, boyo. Even
luck.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Well I guess this is goodbye, my friend. I’ll
never forget you.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: PK. Botha. Nyet, nyet. Nyet, Botha.</p>
<p><strong>rasputin</strong>: PK. Botha. Nyet. Nyet. PK.</p>
<p><strong>driller</strong>: Who you lookin’ for?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Botha. The driller from stope number five.</p>
<p><strong>driller</strong>: He’s at the bar.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>driller</strong>: I wouldn’t disturb him. There’s a reason
he’s there and we’re here.</p>
<p><strong>bartender #1</strong>: PK. You’re not going to go in,</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Is Botha the driller in there?</p>
<p><strong>bartender #2</strong>: Ja. Always we give him one hour alone
before we open. You don’t know this because you work at night, but it is
the rule.</p>
<p><strong>fritz</strong>: Ja. In one hour it is pffft.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Are you Botha?</p>
<p><strong>botha</strong>: Ja.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I’m PK. I worked your grizzly.</p>
<p><strong>botha</strong>: Ja.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Why’d you try to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>botha</strong>: Because I missed the first time, rooinek.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Jaapie Botha.</p>
<p><strong>botha</strong>: You remember, rooinek.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Botha. It was thirteen years ago.</p>
<p><strong>botha</strong>: Because of you they expelled me. Because of
you my father beat me. Threw me out from the farm. Because of you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Botha. We’ve made a lot of money working
together. Let the past be the past.</p>
<p><strong>botha</strong>: You ruined the country, all you rooineks. You
come and ruin the country.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: No, Jaapie Botha. It’s hate ruining the
country.</p>
<p><strong>botha</strong>: Jaah.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Boer hate.</p>
<p><strong>botha</strong>: Our country.</p>
<p><strong>voice #1</strong>: He’s dead. He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>geel piet</strong>: First with the head, then with the heart.
Little defeat big when little is smart.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Want to see the wages of hate?</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: Here. Here is what hate gets you.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: For my chicken. For Geel Piet. For Doc. For
Mandoma. For Maria.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: For Africa.</p>
<p><strong>229 ext. bar 229</strong>: The crowd goes silent as PK
emerges. The crowd parts. PK, looking neither right nor left, begins to
walk away.</p>
<p><strong>pk</strong>: I knew as I walked out of the mines, out of
Africa, that I wasn’t fleeing. That one day I would return. Inkosi
Inkosikasi was right. I was a man for all Africa. Bound to her by my
spirit. Bound by my dreams. And Africa had taught me the lesson I would
take out into the world and one day bring back. Great changes can come
from the power of many. But only when the many join together and create
what is invincible. The Power of One.</p>
