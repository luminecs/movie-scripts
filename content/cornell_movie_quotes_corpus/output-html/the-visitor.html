<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mr. Vale?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hello. I’m Barbra Watson. Nice to meet
you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Can I take your coat?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: OK. Would you like anything to drink?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: No. Shall we get started?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Let’s try it again.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The same thing?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Yes. Remember, fingers curved. Like a
tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Don’t flatten.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Make room for the train.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: I said “make room for the train.” It’s
something that I tell my kids. If you curve your fingers like this… Then
the train can pass through the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Thank you. Next Tuesday at the same
time?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. I don’t think I’m going to continue with
our lessons.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh, no. Are you giving up?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Oh. OK. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Mr. Vale? If I may ask, how many teachers
have you had before me?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Well, for what it’s worth, it’s difficult
to learn an instrument at your age. Especially if you don’t possess a
natural gift for it. I’m not saying this to be mean. But if you do
decide to give up then I would really like to buy your piano. It’s a
beautiful instrument.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: East Asia’s experience is really the
exception to the rule, because the conditions there that made trade
liberalization for the Middle East successful weren’t present in the
developing countries in sub- Saharan Africa, and in Central and South
America.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Sorry it’s late.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why is it late?</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: I had some personal things to deal
with.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m sorry. I can’t accept it now.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: But…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: You know you still haven’t given us a
syllabus.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Hello Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Charles.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’m sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Walter, Shelley can’t make it down to the
NYU conference to present your paper. I’m going to need you to cover for
her.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why can’t she go?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: She’s been put on bed rest until she has
the baby.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Next week. We’ll cover your class and make
the arrangements.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I wish I could, but now is not a very good
time, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I understand but you co-authored the paper
and the Dean wants it presented. He wants to keep Shelley on track for
tenure.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I just don’t think I can with the start of
classes and my book.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: You’re only teaching one class, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So I can stay focused on my writing. I’d
really rather not go right now.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: I’m sorry but there really isn’t another
option at this point.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Charles, the truth is this is really
Shelley’s paper. I just agreed to co-author it because she asked me to.
I’m not really prepared to present it.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: That may be the case but you are the
co-author and she can’t go. Look Walter, you can take it up with the
Dean if you want, but, as your friend, I wouldn’t advise it. Not with
that argument.</p>
<p><strong>charles</strong>: Good bye.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Here you go, cutey.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So I thought you forgot about me. Where’ve
you been hiding?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Just busy with work.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Well you’re never gonna make it on the wall
with that excuse. I’m glad your back. Give a holler if you need
anything. I’m just gabbing with one of my girlfriends.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: When are you going?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Today after class.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Sounds like fun. I’m gonna go have a
cigarette. You want some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>young black woman</strong>: Stay away from me!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s OK. I’m not going…</p>
<p><strong>african woman</strong>: Leave me alone! My boyfriend is
coming home!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>african woman</strong>: Who are you? What are you doing in
here!?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: This is my apartment.</p>
<p><strong>african woman</strong>: What do you mean? This apartment does
not belong to you. How did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: My name is Walter Vale. I have keys. It’s
my…</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: What the fuck?!</p>
<p><strong>young middle eastern man</strong>: Who are you?! Zainab?!</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I’m in here! He is crazy!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Stop it! I am not…</p>
<p><strong>young middle eastern man</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Tarek. What is happening?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I have no idea! I was in the bath and he was
just standing there.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Did you touch her?! Did you touch her?!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: He didn’t touch me! But how did he get in?
He said he has keys.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Do you have keys?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes! Yes! I have keys. It’s my
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: What does he mean it’s his apartment?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I don’t know! Show me your keys!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: This is my apartment. I’ve owned it for
twenty-five years.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: So why haven’t you been here!?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I live in Connecticut. I haven’t used it in
a long time.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Are you friends with Ivan?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Ivan? Who is Ivan?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I knew this would happen! He probably called
the police.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Did you call the police?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You didn’t call the police?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: And you don’t know Ivan?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know Ivan. Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: He rented us this place. He said it belonged
to his friend who was out of town.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know who he is but this is my
apartment. I assure you.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I told you not to trust anyone. You never
saw a contract.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Enough! OK. Look. We don’t want any trouble.
We will get out of your apartment. This is all a mistake. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: We will leave, OK?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. OK.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Where are we going to go?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I don’t know but we have to go.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I know we have to go. I am not stupid!</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. I’m just going to sit down.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Of course. Please.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I’m sorry if I hurt you. Are you sure that
you’re OK?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah. I’m OK.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: OK. Well, we’ll pack up and get out.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I know I’m in trouble when she starts
speaking Wolof.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How long have you lived here?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Two months. We will pay you if you want.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Is that everything?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I think so. Do you want to check!?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Here is the coffee you wanted.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: OK. So we’ll go. I am sorry again. Thank you
for your understanding. Good bye.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Good bye.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Look I know. Come on man, it’ll just be for a
night or two until we figure something out. OK.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Tarek?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Can you check and call me back? OK.
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Tarek?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You left this at the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Do you know where you’re going to stay
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You like classical music, huh?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Me too. Do you play piano?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Me? No. I play the djembe. Well, thanks again
for letting us stay. You saved me a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: See you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: OK. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Stop it, Tarek. He’ll hear us.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Trust me. He’s asleep.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: You don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: So let him hear. The guy probably needs some
excitement.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I think he’s probably had enough for one
night.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Tarek. No!</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: What are we going to do, Tarek?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I don’t know. We’ll figure it out tomorrow.
Who knows? Maybe he’ll let us stay. He’s not really using the place.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I don’t want to be his roommate!</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: OK. OK. So we’ll figure it out in the
morning. I promise, habibti.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Do you still love me?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: No. I don’t love you.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Not even a little?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: So what is this?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: It’s your punishment.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: But what about our roommate?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Shhh.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I made some coffee.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Have a good day.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>speaker</strong>: That will be on the last day of conference.
I hope you can all attend. And now I’d like to welcome my distinguished
colleague and the winner of John Bates Clark Award, Stephen
Kriegman.</p>
<p><strong>stephen kriegman</strong>: Thank you, Shiva. Good morning.
It’s a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p><strong>colleague #1</strong>: And so I just stood up and walked
out!</p>
<p><strong>stephen kriegman</strong>: Jamie!</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Stephen, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged man</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged man</strong>: Are you Mr. Vale?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged man</strong>: I thought so. How are you? It’s me,
Jacob Konigsberg. Do you remember me?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I used to live here with my mother. Your wife
used to give me piano lessons.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh. Right.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: It has been a long time. I thought that maybe
you sold the place. Oh. This is Sprinkles. Say “hi”, Sprinkles. Is your
wife here with you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. She passed away.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: What?! No! I had no idea. I’m so sorry. She
was such a nice lady. And I just loved listening to her play.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How’s your mother?</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: She moved to Florida. Now I live here. It’s
nice. There are a lot of new faces. I hardly know anyone anymore. But I
have Sprinkles so…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Nice to see you, Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: You too, Mr. Vale. Goodbye. Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It is important to distinguish between both
our current political assessment and our…It is important to distinguish
between our current political assessment…</p>
<p><strong>german economist</strong>: However, we do find that financial
globalization can be beneficial under the right circumstances.
Empirically, good institutions and quality of governance are crucial in
helping developing countries derive the benefits of globalization.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: We should have them come play
inside.</p>
<p><strong>colleague #1</strong>: Coming in?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. In a minute. I have to make a call.</p>
<p><strong>colleague #1</strong>: See you inside.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Hey Walter. Welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You’re home early.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It was a half day.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: How was the conference?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Sorry about the pants. I’ve been playing like
this since I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Hey. I think I might have a lead on a place
in Brooklyn.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s good. You can keep practicing if you
like.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Really? It won’t bother you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Great. Thanks. I’ll keep my pants on.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Hey, Zainab’s going to make dinner if you
want to eat with us later.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: OK. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I’m sorry. That was my mother. If I don’t
call her every day she thinks something happened to me.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yeah. I’ll have a bit. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Are you sure that you wouldn’t like
some?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I don’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: She is a good Muslim. I’m a bad one.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Are you finished?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. Thank you. Here, let me…</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: It’s the least I can do.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, thank you for the dinner. It was very
good.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: So what’s the conference about?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Economic Growth in Developing Nations.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: That’s us. Syria. Senegal.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: So have you written some books?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Three. I’m working on my fourth.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Four books?! Great. My father was a writer. A
journalist.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Is he still writing?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: No. He died. Before we left Syria.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Tarek. It’s eight-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Oh. We have to go. I have a gig tonight.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Walter, you can come if you want.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I have to get some work done but thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: OK. Well maybe another time</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Why did you invite him?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: We’re staying in his apartment. What could I
do?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Well I would have been the one stuck sitting
with him while you played your drum.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You know you are very sexy when you’re mad at
me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: If you don’t mind, I think I will come.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The whole band is very good.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Sorry guys. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tarek?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tarek?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: It sounded good Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah. Well. I was just…I’m sorry if I…</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Don’t be sorry. That’s what it’s there
for.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I was lying on my bed listening to my music
and then I was like “what’s the crazy rhythm I’m hearing?”.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Sit. Come on. I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Just put your feet flat on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Now take the drum between your legs. Like
this.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Now you want to lift the inside edge off the
ground with your ankles. Like this.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Great. Feel OK?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: OK. Now Walter, I know you’re a very smart
man but with the drum you have to remember not to think. Thinking just
screws it up. OK?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Now just give it a couple of bangs.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Not so hard. You’re not angry at it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh. Right. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Better. Did you think?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Good. Now one more thing, Walter. You listen
to classical music so you think in fours. One. Two. Three. Four. Da. Da.
Da. Da. This is an African drum. So we are gonna play in three’s. Tat.
Tat. Tat. You have to forget your classical. Leave it behind. Tat. Tat.
Tat. One. Two. Three. Come on. Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Good. Good ear. Now keep going.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Don’t worry. Start again.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yeah! There it is. OK. Good. Now keep it
going and I will do this.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yeah. That’s it. Keep it going.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Hello. Where is Tarek?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He went out. To look at another
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah. Tarek is teaching me the drum. I’m
practicing. Don’t worry, I’ll keep my pants on.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Nothing. I was just…nothing.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Hey Walter, what time are you done
tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I have to present a paper at eleven. I
should be done by twelve- thirty.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: Hey man, could we get another order of this?
I love this food.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: That’s good. Because the Chinese are taking
over the world.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: That’s not gonna happen.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: It’s already happening. One day our kids will
be going to China for jobs. Ask Walter.</p>
<p><strong>darren</strong>: You think that’s true?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well…if China continues to threaten the wage
earners in the first-world economies by keeping wages down, then it’s
really just a matter of time. What they buy they inflate. What they sell
they deflate. But then you have to ask the question `who’s paying the
cost?’. And the answer is the Chinese people.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You see?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Hey, Walter!</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: How did the presentation go?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fine. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Cool. Guess what? I found an apartment in
Brooklyn. We can move in on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yeah. It’s small but it’s a nice building. I
just hope Zainab likes it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I think she will as long as no else lives
there.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I think you’re right. Come on, let’s go. You
should take off the name tag.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh. Yeah. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yeah. I’m starving. Do you like shwarmas?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uh…yeah. I like sharmas.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Shwarmas.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Here. This is for you. For letting us
stay.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: It’s Fela Kuti. You know him?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You don’t know Fela? Oh, man! Walter, you are
in for a treat. He started the whole Afro-Beat movement. And his drummer
Tony Allen was just scary, man. You want to play drums, you have to
listen to this.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: OK. I will.</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: Hey Tarek. How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Good, Omar. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: Not bad. It’s fall in New York, you know?
How’s the band?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Good. Playing a lot. New girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: New friend.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You have a lot friends</p>
<p><strong>omar</strong>: I’m a very nice guy. Au revoir.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Au revoir.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: The Lebanese. Bunch of playboys. You
ready?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Yes. I made it.</p>
<p><strong>upper east side woman</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Thirty-five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>upper east side woman</strong>: Will you take thirty?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: No. thiry-five.</p>
<p><strong>upper east side woman</strong>: OK. I know my daughter will
think it’s “cool”. Here.</p>
<p><strong>upper east side woman</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Senegal.</p>
<p><strong>upper east side woman</strong>: Oh. I was in Cape Town two
winters ago. It was just beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>upper east side woman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: How far is Senegal from Cape Town?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Far.</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: I told a guy I was from Israel yesterday and he
asked if I had ever visited the Holy Land.</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: Hey, look who it is. What’s up Tarek?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Zev! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: Good man.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Hey honey.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Hello. Hi, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: How’s business?</p>
<p><strong>zev</strong>: Ahh. You know.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Her stuff is great, right? She made me
this?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You should make one for Walter.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: So Walter and I are going up to the park to
play for a little bit. OK?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Tarek, I told you we have to pick up my new
table today. He said he would only hold it for today.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I know. I know. No problem.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Tarek. You always say “no problem” and then
you are late or you forget.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I know. I will not be long. We’ll go up and
play and then we’ll come back to help you. I promise, habibti.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Yes. It’s always “habibti” when you want
your way. It closes at five p.m. Not Arab time, Tarek.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: No. Not Arab time. Real time, habibti.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Don’t “habibti” me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What does habibti mean?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Habibti? It means “beloved one”.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Does she know that?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: He’s been playing here for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Is he good?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I have no idea but it’s cool. I always wanted
to play down here. It’s supposed to be good money.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So why haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Maybe some day we can do it together. Split
the profits.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I think I’ll just watch.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Come on, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: It’s easy. You just wait until you feel it.
Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Shit, we have to get home. Zainab is gonna
kill me. I’m on Arab time again.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What is Arab time?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: It means I’m late by an hour. All Arabs are
late by an hour. It’s genetic. We can’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: That’s our train!</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I got your drum. My card is empty. Can you
swipe me?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Hey. You paid for the drum and not me. Here
take this.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I think we missed it. Zainab is not going to
be happy if…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Excuse me, sir. Could you please step over
here.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: NYPD. Could you please step over here?</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Just step over here, pal.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Please, what do you want…</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: You jumped the turnstile.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I did not jump it! I paid. I paid! It just
didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Sir, I did pay his fare.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Could you step back please?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: But I paid this man’s…</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Sir, stand over there.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Can I see some ID.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: You got anything else, Tarek.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cop #1</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Syria. Why?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Why? I’m sorry. What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t think that’s necessary.</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Well we do. You can come down to the station
and make a statement.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: But he didn’t mean…</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Sir, that’s all I’m saying. Now step back or
we are gonna take you in too.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Where are you taking him?</p>
<p><strong>cop #2</strong>: Ninth Precinct.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Walter take the drum. Tell Zainab what
happened but don’t let her come for me. I will call you.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Don’t let her come! I will call her!</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Where is Tarek?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He was arrested.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. In the subway.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Arrested?!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. It was just a misunderstanding. They
said he would be released later tonight.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: How could this happen? He knows better! He
would not do anything wrong.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He didn’t. I’m sure we it will be</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: No. It won’t be OK.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes it will. I went down to the precinct and
made a statement.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: That doesn’t matter! He is illegal! As am I!
We are not citizens. Do you know what that means? Do you?! Of course you
don’t. How could you?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. His name is Tarek Khalil. Khalil. K. H.
A. L. I. L. That’s right. Yes. I came down and made a statement. They
said he would be released. That was six hours ago. Well when should we
know? Tomorrow? Why? But he…OK. OK. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: They’ve moved him.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: To where?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: To a detention center in Queens. He was
turned over to immigration. They said we can see him during visiting
hours tomorrow night from five to ten.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I can’t visit him or I will end up in that
place too.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Yes. We are going tomorrow. The appointment
is at eleven. I don’t know, he found him. What? No. I don’t want to. I
just don’t, Tarek. Yes. I’ve already called him. I know. I know. I just
want you to be here with me, Tarek.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Zainab, you’re also undocumented,
right?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: You know you can’t visit Tarek at the
detention center, right?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Yes. I know.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: How long have you known Tarek?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Almost a year.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Mr. Vale?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: A week.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: A week?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Does Tarek have any family living
here?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: His mother lives in Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: She’s also undocumented, correct?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: It’s OK. This is all confidential.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Yes, she is.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Does she know that Tarek is in
custody?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: No. Tarek told me not to tell her. He
doesn’t want to worry her.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Has he ever been convicted of a crime?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: No. He has had no trouble. He is a good
person.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Do you know if they ever applied for
asylum?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Yes. When he first arrived from Syria. But
he didn’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: When was that?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Seven years ago.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: And did they appeal it?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why wouldn’t they appeal it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Fear of being deported. It used to be that
when your asylum case was denied, they let you go until your appeal. A
lot of people didn’t bother with it. Getting denied once was enough to
spook them.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So what happens if that’s the case?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Then there may be a final order of
deportation on him which means he won’t even go before a judge this
time. He’ll just be deported.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: They had to leave Syria! They had no
choice!</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Look, one step at a time. Let me talk to
him then we’ll have a better idea of his status and what our options
are.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Is there anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Visit him.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: That detainee has been moved.</p>
<p><strong>slavic man</strong>: To where?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>slavic man</strong>: He was here yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: But now he’s not. That’s all I know. You can
call ICE. The number is on the wall. Next. Sir, step aside please.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hi. I’m here to see Tarek Khalil.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: You been here before?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Can I see your license please?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Walter. Thank you for coming.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: How is Zainab?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She’s upset. I have a letter from her.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You can’t give it to me. It has to be sent to
me by mail. But you can put it up to the glass.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Go ahead. Open it and place it up to the
glass so I can read it. It’s OK. It’s allowed.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Thank you, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How are they treating you?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: OK. The place is very depressing. There is no
privacy. The lights are always on.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Do you need anything?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: No. I just want to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Zainab and I met with a lawyer today.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yes. What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He is going to stop by to see you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tarek, Zainab said you were denied
asylum.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You mean when we came here? Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did you go to your deportation hearing?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yeah. We did everything they told us to.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Hey, could you tell Darren? I didn’t call
him.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I have to go. They have to do a bed count.
Usually, I can visit for one hour. Can you come tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Good. And tell Zainab I will call her as soon
as I can.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Goodbye, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Did you ask him if he went to his
hearing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. He said that he did.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Walter, I’m going to leave now. I have a
cousin in the Bronx. I will stay with him for now.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You don’t have to leave. You can stay
here.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I think it’s best if I leave. When Tarek
calls me then I will tell him. You know how to reach me if you need to.
Is it OK if I leave Tarek’s things here for now? My cousin’s place is
not very big.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: But I thought you said you went to the
hearing.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: We did. I remember it.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So why is there a final order on you? Did he
say?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: No. He didn’t know yet. He just said that
unless he can find a way to reopen the case quickly they’re going to
deport me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Maybe you should call your mother. She might
have…</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: No. I don’t want her to worry. I can handle
this.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Did he say anything else?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yeah. Three years ago I was working for some
guy who said he was going to sponsor me for my green card but then he
turned out to be jerk. But the lawyer said that might allow us to reopen
the case. I don’t even understand it.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Walter, there are guys who have been in here
for years! I can’t do that Walter. I’ll go crazy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He’s trying to deal with the case as quickly
as possible.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tarek. I have to go back to Connecticut.
I’ll be reachable by phone if you need me for anything.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: OK. Just please…don’t forget about me in
here.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Are you still practicing?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You should go back to the drum circle.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: OK. But listen to that Fela CD. That will
help you, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: So show me what you’ve been working on.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Show me. On that. Come on. I need some music,
man.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Don’t worry. They can’t arrest you. At least
not yet.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Ah. There it is. Good. Good. You are getting
better.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>arab woman</strong>: I’m sorry. I must have the wrong
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>arab woman</strong>: I’m looking for my son.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Are you Tarek’s mother?</p>
<p><strong>arab woman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Oh. This is Tarek’s apartment. I…share the
apartment with him.</p>
<p><strong>arab woman</strong>: He did not mention that he lived with
someone.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not here very often. I live in
Connecticut.</p>
<p><strong>arab woman</strong>: Is Tarek here?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. He’s…uh…he’s not here. But please come
in.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>arab woman</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m Walter. Walter Vale.</p>
<p><strong>arab woman</strong>: I’m Mouna Khalil. I’m sorry to show up
unannounced but my son calls me everyday. He has not called me now for
five days. I have tried his cell phone but he does not answer.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Would you like to sit down?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Would you like something to drink? Coffee or
water?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: No. Is my son alright, Mr. Vale?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tarek was arrested. He’s being held in a
detention center in Queens. They are trying to deport him.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Where is Queens?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s not far from here. Twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: You have been there?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. I saw him yesterday. He’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: How did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He was stopped in the subway station. He
didn’t do anything wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I would like to go there. To Queens.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: OK. But Mrs. Khalil. The lawyer mentioned
that…I don’t think that you can…</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I know I can’t visit Tarek, Mr. Vale. I just
want to see where they are holding him.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: OK. I can take you if you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Let me get my coat.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Have you been to New York before,
Mrs. Khalil?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: No. Tarek wanted to come to New York to play
music. I did not want him to go but…do you have children, Mr. Vale?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I have a son. He lives in London.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: And your wife?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: My wife passed away.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: This is where the prison is?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: It does not look like a prison.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I think that’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: How many people are in there?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tarek said about three hundred.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: There is a coffee shop on that corner. It’s
not very nice but…</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I’ll wait there. Here.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Walter, I thought you were leaving.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I was. Tarek, your mother is here.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: What? My mother?! Where?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She is waiting outside.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: When did she arrive?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Today.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Oh man. Why did she come? She can do nothing
for me.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She said she hadn’t heard from you.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Walter. Listen to me. She can not stay here.
She doesn’t know anyone in New York. I’m sorry but you must get her to
go back to Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: OK. OK. Here. I have a letter from her.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Do you need anything else?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I am Palestinian from Damascus.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Ah. I knew it. I am from Egypt. Alexandria.
I’m Nasim. Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I am visiting my son.</p>
<p><strong>nasim</strong>: He is in detention.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nasim</strong>: It’s a bad place. I’m lucky. I have a green
card.</p>
<p><strong>nasim</strong>: They’re the ones taking care of your son.
They come here everyday. They don’t tip.</p>
<p><strong>nasim</strong>: Don’t worry. They can’t understand us.</p>
<p><strong>nasim</strong>: Hello, sir.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He’s good but he’s concerned about you being
here.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I will not leave.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Mrs. Khalil, I’m not sure that your being in
New York will do any good. We have a very good lawyer working on Tarek’s
case…</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Mr. Vale, I cannot go back to Michigan
knowing that my son is in that building. Even if I can’t see him, I will
stay.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Shall we go?</p>
<p><strong>nasim</strong>: The tea is on me.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nasim</strong>: Is that your lawyer? Or your husband?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>nasim</strong>: See you next time.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh. Hello, Mr. Vale.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hello, Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh, hello again. Did you find your son?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: I let her in earlier. I’m Jacob, by the way.
I live on the third floor. And this is Sprinkles.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Nice to meet you, Jacob. I’m Mouna.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: So you two know each other?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes. Mr. Vale knows my son.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh. Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Tarek.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh. Tarek. He is very nice. And so is his
girlfriend. They are both so polite.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: My mother and I are planning a trip to go to
Israel next summer. She’s always wanted to go.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I hope you enjoy it. Now if you’ll excuse
me.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Oh sure. We need to go on our walk and do our
business. Very nice to meet you, Mouna.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: You too, Jacob.</p>
<p><strong>jacob</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Vale.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Vale.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I will find a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You can stay here. You can use Tarek’s
room.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you for your offer but I cannot accept
this. I don’t want to impose on you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re not imposing. Please. I would like
you to stay.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Again, thank you. But I will manage.
Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Mrs. Khalil?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Please. I was with Tarek when he was
arrested. He was in the subway in the first place because of me. Please.
Stay. Even if it’s just for the night.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: The bathroom is just across the hall.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Vale.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You can call me Walter.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: And I am Mouna.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Do you need anything else?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: No. Thank you. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Tarek said hello.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I can’t really tell. He wants me to leave.
But I am not leaving.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, you can stay here as long as you need
to.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you. That is very generous of you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Thank you for the newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Walter? Did Tarek and his girlfriend, Zainab,
live here together?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Uhm…Yes. They did.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: And where is she now?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: She’s staying with her cousin in the
Bronx.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I would like to meet her.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: We can go by her stall.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Her what?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Her stall. She sells jewelry in a stall.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Oh. OK.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Do you spend a lot of time in the city?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. Not really. I just came down to present
a paper at a conference.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: You wrote it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. Well I coauthored it.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: And what happened after the hearing?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: We appealed. It took two years.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: And your appeal was denied?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Then they should have sent you a
bag-and-baggage letter which basically tells you where to show up and be
deported.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: But you didn’t receive it?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes. I would remember this.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Did you move?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes. Eventually we had to. But we had our
mail advanced.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Well, it wouldn’t be the first time that
happened. And pre 9/11 it wasn’t much of a priority tracking people
down.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: So if they didn’t get the letter then does
this help us?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: It keeps our chances alive. If they got it
and just ignored it then we couldn’t push to reopen the case.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: So you can help him?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: It’s still a long shot. Like I said, the
Government’s approach has changed radically.</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: It’s very black and white now. Either you
belong or you don’t. Which means a lot of people who have been living
here for years are suddenly being swept up and thrown into detention.
Tarek’s lucky. Most of them don’t even have lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Lucky?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Relatively speaking. We just have to move
quickly to get an emergency stay from the board of immigration. Then,
we’ll stick with the motion to reopen pending his green card
application.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Can you explain what that means?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Actually, I don’t have the time right now.
I have to be in court very shortly</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: How long will he be in detention?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: I can’t predict that. I’m sorry but I am
gonna have to wrap this up.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Do you have children, Mr. Shah?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Yeah. Two kids. And for what it’s worth my
uncle was deported after raising a family here for twenty- three years.
If I can get Tarek out, I will.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you. Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>mr. shah</strong>: Queens.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Which one is she?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: There. In the middle.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: The black woman? That is Zainab?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: She is very black.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hi Zainab. This is Mouna Khalil. Tarek’s
mother.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Hello, Zainab.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: It is a pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Khalil.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Please. Call me Mouna.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: OK. I’m sorry. I did not know you were
coming.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Neither did I.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Your jewelry is very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Do you have time for coffee or a walk?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Yes. I would like that. But I have to watch
my table.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I’m living with my cousin. He has two kids.
And his mother. I mean his wife…I’m sorry, I am very nervous.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I don’t know. Have you spoken with
Tarek?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes. He called me this morning. He is doing
all right.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I wish that I could see him. Just for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Me too. How long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Two years. I was in detention when I first
arrived. Three months. It was horrible. I would probably still be there
but they closed the facility for poor conditions. They released some of
the women on parole because we were…low risk. I met Tarek one year
later. I am sorry for what happened with Tarek. I hope you do not blame
me.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Blame you? No. I do not blame you.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Tarek was doing nothing wrong. I miss him so
much. I don’t know what I am going to do without him.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: He said the same thing about you.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: He did?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Zainab, I would like you to do something for
me.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I would like you to show me something that
you and Tarek liked to do. Some place that you like to go.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Anything. Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: OK. But maybe we should get Walter
first.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: So what is in Staten Island?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: I don’t know. We never got off. We just
would go to the other side and then come back.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: It’s free. And it felt like we were going
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: That is where the towers were. I never saw
them but Tarek did.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: And over there is the Statue. And behind
that is Ellis Island.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Sometimes Tarek would point at the statue
and jump up and down like we were arriving to New York for the first
time. It was very funny.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Can you go up in the Statue?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. I think so.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: You haven’t been?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Excuse me. Hello? Oh. Hi Charles.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What’s that? Yes. I’m still in New York
actually. I stayed down here to do some research. What’s that? Oh. I’m
on a boat. Yes, a boat.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Listen Charles, I’ll explain when I see you
but I have to go right now. I’ll call you back. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You went on the ferry?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: My mother too?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. She liked it.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Did Zainab tell you how we used pretend we
arriving in New York for the first time?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah. She told us.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You know they don’t even let us outside here.
They just cut a hole in the roof in one place.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: Yeah. It’s crazy stuff.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: And they seemed to get along? Zainab and my
mother?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. I think your mother likes her very
much.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: My mother’s not going home, is she?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I know she’s thinking about my father. He
spent seven years in jail in Syria for something he wrote in the
newspaper. By the time they released him he was very sick. He died two
months later. That’s when we came here.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: She thinks the same thing is gonna happen to
me.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: You know I have never seen them together.
Zainab and my mother.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Are you hungry, Mouna? We can stop for
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I would prefer to cook if you don’t mind?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Should we stop at a market?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah. That’s probably a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Would you like a glass of wine?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Mouna? I need to go back to Connecticut
tomorrow. For work. I told Tarek.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: How long will you be gone?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know yet. I’ll try to make it back
to visit Tarek as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: You don’t have keep visiting him, Walter. I’m
sure you are busy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: OK. Dinner will be ready soon.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Do you go to Broadway, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Broadway? Uhm. No. I haven’t been in a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Tarek sent me the CD for “Phantom of the
Opera” for my birthday. The music is lovely. Have you seen it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I haven’t either but I think I know every
word.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Tarek is teaching me the drum.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Really? How is it going?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, I sound a lot better when he’s playing
with me.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: How is your teaching going, Walter?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: My teaching?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well…I have a lighter schedule so I can work
on my book.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Your book? What is it about?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, it covers quite a bit, so it’s hard to
explain.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Are you almost finished?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m close.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: You don’t like to talk about your work?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. It’s just a bit complicated.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It just is. It’s just not a process that’s
easy to talk about with someone who’s not a writer.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I didn’t mean to pry.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I shouldn’t have spoken to you like
that.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: It’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Thank you. You have my number if you need
anything.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I’ll be fine. Thank you. Have a safe
trip.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well good bye.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Good afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Walter.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I did not expect you so soon. I was just
cleaning a bit. I hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I like this CD very much. The music is
lovely.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Is it your wife?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: She was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: These are different glasses?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Are they new?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: They’re nice.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I was going to make some lunch. Are you
hungry?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Mouna?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I was wondering if…Thursday night … Do you
have plans?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: No, Walter, I have no plans.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well, I thought that…we might do
something.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: They keep moving people.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: To where?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I don’t know. I think to other detention
centers. Two Moroccan guys were just moved. They had no idea. Suddenly
they were just gone.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Has anyone said anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: No one in here knows anything. I’m not a
criminal. I have committed no crime. What do they think? I’m a
terrorist? There are no terrorists in here. The terrorists have money.
They have support. This is not fair!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: How do you know?! You’re out there!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: It’s just… I’m starting to wonder if I’m ever
going to get out of here. I sit in here at night and I keep thinking
about Zainab.</p>
<p><strong>tarek</strong>: I just want to play my music and live my
life. What’s so wrong about that?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: OK. OK. Please do. Thank you. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He would make some calls but they can move
him to another facility at their discretion.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: What facility? Where?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He said it could be anywhere. Upstate.
Pennsylvania. There is even one in Louisiana.</p>
<p><strong>zainab</strong>: Louisiana? Where they had the floods?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: That’s so far.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Did the lawyer say anything else?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. No he didn’t know anything else.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: No one seems to know anything. It feels like
Syria.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Sorry to keep you waiting.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: That’s alright. How is he?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: He says hello. He wants to make sure that you
are practicing your drum.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I am. You look very nice.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: You too. Should we go?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: This city is just so huge! It never ends.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Really? The Phantom? Are we seeing it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. Is that OK?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: That’s wonderful. Thank you. I am so
excited.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I have to say that show was really kind of
scary.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yeah. It was kind of scary.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Are you finished?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: How is everything?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Very good. But I think I would like a glass
of wine.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t even think to ask.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: It’s OK. It’s not every night that you see
The Phantom. I’ll have a cabernet.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Two please.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I haven’t been to theatre in a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Me neither. There is a place in Syria called
Maaloula. It is a huge outdoor theater. It’s beautiful. We used to take
Tarek there to see concerts.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Mouna, I’ve taken a leave of absence for the
rest of the semester.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Really? Why?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I just thought I might spend some more time
in New York.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Walter, you do not have to do this for
Tarek.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I want to.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: But you have to be in Connecticut. You have
your teaching. And your book.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s fine really.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: This is not your problem, Walter. It’s OK
that you are busy.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m not busy. Not at all. Mouna, the truth
is I haven’t been doing any work for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: You just presented your paper at the
conference.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I didn’t even write it. I just read it. I’ve
been teaching the same course for twenty years. It doesn’t mean anything
to me. None of it does. I pretend. I pretend that I’m busy. That I’m
writing. Working. But I’m not doing anything.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Don’t be. I appreciate you telling me
this.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Walter, what would you do if you didn’t
teach?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I think that is exciting. Not to know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Mouna, what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Do you mean for work?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I work in a car dealership. I take care of
the accounting.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes. It’s very exciting.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>walter.</strong>: Twelve thirty.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: No?! Is it?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: My God. Twelve-thirty! I have not been up
this late in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I think that happens a lot in New York.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you, Walter. That was a very nice
evening. It’s the most fun I’ve had in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I told Tarek I was going to take you. He was
very happy about it.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Good night, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: There’s a message from Tarek. Something’s
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Just that they were moving him. He didn’t
know what it meant.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well when do you expect him back? Can you
have him call me the minute he is? It’s an emergency. Thank you. He’s
still in court. Can you hurry please?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I hate this feeling.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Hello. I’m here for bed 38. Tarek
Khalil.</p>
<p><strong>male guard</strong>: He is no longer with us.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>male guard</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re not sure? Was he moved to another
facility? Another state? What?</p>
<p><strong>male guard</strong>: I don’t know. I just know that this
detainee is no longer in the facility.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Well can you ask someone who does know?!</p>
<p><strong>male guard</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>male guard</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes. Did you find him?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: He’s been removed.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Removed? To where?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Deported.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: What? When?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: He was deported this morning.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: He…how can that be? Is there any way to
contact him?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I don’t know. I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You don’t think so? What kind of answer is
that?!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: I’m sorry, sir. That’s all the information
that I have. Now please step away from the window. You can call the ICE
if you have any further questions. The number is on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sir. Please step away from my window.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sir. For the last time, step away from my
window.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You can’t just take people away like that!
Do you hear me?! He was a good man. A good person! He had a life here!
You can’t just take away whoever you want!</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s not fair! We are not just helpless
children! Do you hear me?!</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Walter.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Walter. Let’s go. There is nothing we can do.
Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Come on, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: He did nothing wrong.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Walter, I need to go back to Syria. I should
to be there for Tarek.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: When are you going to leave?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Tomorrow. I already bought a ticket. It’s
best for me to be there as soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You won’t be able to come back here.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Mouna. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Good night, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: It’s my fault. What happened to Tarek. I did
receive the letter telling us to leave. I threw it away. I never told
him.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: We were here for three years by the time the
letter arrived. I had found a job. Tarek was in school. Everyone told me
not to worry. That the government did not care. And it appeared to be
true. And then, after time, you forget. You think that you really
belong.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: It’s not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Have you visited your son in London?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: No. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: You should visit him.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Zainab and I picked it out especially for
you.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Thank you. It’s very nice.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: So do I. You look cool.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Cool?</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Yes. You are very cool, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I should go.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: Thank you, Walter. For everything.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I don’t want you to go.</p>
<p><strong>mouna</strong>: I don’t want to go, habibi.</p>
