<h1 id="i-am-number-four">i-am-number-four</h1>
<p><strong>a billion stars</strong>: pinprick the velvet-black sky that
stretches over a vast sleeping jungle. A fingernail moon silvers the
whispering canopy while gentle tendrils of steam rise.</p>
<p><strong>a bungalow.</strong>: It’s 20x20 square, with a wraparound
porch and simple wooden shutters. The structure is hidden in a clearing
that’s been crudely hacked out of the sweaty wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>the door softly rattles.</strong>: The Teen’s eyes fly open.
Fear grips his face as he looks over at the Man, who is now upright and
awake. They hold their breath, listening over the DRUMMING CHORUS.</p>
<p><strong>another rattle.</strong>: It’s louder this time.
Unmistakable. The Teen watches as the Man pulls a crystal-handled dagger
from under his pillow and stealthily creeps to the door. The Man
cautiously leans in and peers through the bamboo slats.</p>
<p><strong>what he sees</strong>: The empty porch. No sign of life.
Relieved, he turns back, opens his mouth to speak when his face
contorts. He looks down and sees the tip of</p>
<p><strong>a serrated metal blade</strong>: protruding from his chest.
As the sword is viciously protracted through the door, the Man meets the
Teen’s haunted eyes and whispers his last, desperate word…</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged man</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>a monstrous howl</strong>: ECHOES as something otherworldly
catches his scent and begins thrashing in pursuit. The Teen’s face
tightens with dread and the SHOUTS of his pursuers hammer his ears. He
doesn’t look back, willing himself to survive. He races up a verge and
fearlessly launches himself off the edge of</p>
<p><strong>a 100-foot-wide ravine!</strong>: GOD SHOT LOOKING DOWN as
the Teen leaps across the abyss. He kicks air as he arcs and finally
touches down on the opposite lip. Chest heaving, he sees the hideous
silhouette of</p>
<p><strong>a hulking beast.</strong>: It’s called a Piken and skitters
to a stop on the other side. It utters a chilling BANSHEE WAIL of
frustration. Relieved, the Teen turns to make his escape when</p>
<p><strong>a hand</strong>: wraps around his throat. He is effortlessly
hoisted by a TOWERING MAN with skin as cold and pale as alabaster.</p>
<p><strong>this is a mogadorian.</strong>: He wears the long red coat of
a Commander. We catch the briefest glimpse of his cruel magenta eyes as
they scan the geometric symbol engraved on the Teen’s pendant.
Silhouetted against the giant jungle moon, he triumphantly raises</p>
<p><strong>a sword.</strong>: Its serrated blade ignites with silver
flame as it sweeps towards the Teen. The boy’s DEATH CRY echoes as the
CAMERA ZEROES IN ON the pendant that glows brilliant-bright.</p>
<p><strong>the same symbol.</strong>: It glimmers to life on the ankle
of another TEEN 10,000 miles away. His name’s DANIEL and he’s in the
middle of a wild jet- ski race with TWO BUDDIES.</p>
<p><strong>the symbol</strong>: searing into his skin. As he leans
forward to grip his ankle, he cartwheels off the jet ski and viciously
body-slams across the water.</p>
<p><strong>blonde girl</strong>: Daniel, what’s wrong? Did you break
your ankle? But as she turns him over, she sees the light leaking from
between his fingers and reels back.</p>
<p><strong>blonde girl</strong>: Oh my God. He stares up into the
crowd’s fearful faces, then staggers to his feet and takes off
running.</p>
<p><strong>a stilt house</strong>: sits at the end. It’s cake-frosting
pink and is built right on the edge of a coral-white beach.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Number 3 is dead. Henri’s eyes narrow with
urgency. He is immediately on his feet, he kneels at Daniel’s side and
studies the symbol on the teen’s ankle. It has stopped glowing but is
painfully raw. Directly below this fresh wound are</p>
<p><strong>two other geometric brands.</strong>: They are the same size,
but each symbol is subtly different. Time has transformed them into
raised, snake-smooth scars. Henri’s penetrating eyes look up at the
shell-shocked teen.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Did anybody else see this? OFF Daniel’s
panicked nod…</p>
<p><strong>a gecko</strong>: skitters across the ceiling, its glossy
black eyes watch as Daniel frantically stuffs his clothes into a duffel
bag. The walls are bare. No photos, no posters, no personality. Henri
enters, holding a crate of computer cables.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Taillights in five minutes. What we can’t
carry –</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: – we burn. I know the drill.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Time to go.</p>
<p><strong>the gecko.</strong>: It darts up the fender, squeezes into
the jamb of the trunk, and Houdinis into the vehicle with a flick of its
tail.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: This is the part I hate the most. The
running. But it’s the only thing in my life that’s real. The rest is a
lie. My name. My birthday. Even Henri. People think he’s my father. He’s
not. His job is to keep me alive.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: We are hiding from the Mogadorians. A brutal
race that wiped out our entire planet, Lorien.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Only nine children escaped the genocide. We
were each given a number and sent here to hide. I don’t know where the
others are. I only know when one of them is murdered.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I got the first scar when I was eight. I
woke up screaming. We lived in Vermont. The second was on a Tilt-a-Whirl
at a fair in Michigan. I was 12. Yesterday was the third. His finger
traces the lines of the other two scars.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Because of the spell our Elders cast, the
Mogs can only kill us in order. That’s the reason I’ve survived this
long. But our enemy is relentless.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Now their hunt has turned to me. I am number
4.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Florida’s clear. I sent a letter to the
school and there’s nothing in the papers.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: I didn’t even get a chance to say goodbye.
Henri keeps going, passes an envelope across the table.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: New IDs. Daniel pulls out his birth
certificate, reads the name.</p>
<p><strong>daniel</strong>: Just when I think you can’t get any less
original, you lower the bar.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I’m not interested in originality. I’m
interested in untraceable. There are 335,321 John Smiths in the United
States. John looks at him, then abruptly gets up and storms away. Henri
drops $20 on the table and calmly heads after him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s been so long since the last scar.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You got lulled into a false sense of
security. That’s my fault. John struggles to keep his temper in
check.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I liked Florida. I liked having friends. I
liked feeling normal. Henri’s face softens with paternal compassion.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I wish that you could have a normal life –
but you can’t. Only now does John turn and face him. His eyes blaze with
frustration.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Then why fake it? Why not just go hole up in
the wilderness.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: That’s exactly what Number 3 did.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: It’s from an African news site. A man and his
son went missing two nights ago. The locals think they were taken by
strange beasts. John understands the implication.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Piken.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: The Mogadorians are natural-born hunters.
Blending in is our best protection.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So we just keep moving from town to town?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Until I say otherwise – yes. John waits as a
TRUCKER passes through the room. His voice softens but never loses its
intensity.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I want to be from someplace, Henri.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You are.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lorien’s your home, I don’t even remember it.
John’s tone rubs Henri the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Like it or not, it’s your home too. You have
a responsibility to those who died.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I want a say in where we live. You already
picked it, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Cheer up, you’re going to be living in
Paradise.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: A frigid sheet of RAIN POUNDS the sign
that’s planted on the side of this narrow stretch of rural blacktop:</p>
<p><strong>“welcome to paradise, ohio. pop. 5,243”</strong>: The silver
SUV streaks past, its wipers working overtime. It kicks up a spray as it
speeds down Main Street. The dinky storefronts are garishly decorated
for Halloween.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She looks even perkier than the realtor in
Florida. A warm smile graces her round face and she’s clutching a fruit
basket. For the record, she is called ANNIE.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: John Smith.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Where are you from, John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Arizona.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Why did you move to Paradise?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because you’re an asshole. John waits for a
reaction but doesn’t get one…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because my dad needs peace and quiet to
research his book. Henri nods and smiles wryly.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: This was a lot easier when you were</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Here we are. Home sweet home. They scan the
faded interior. The place is in desperate need of a makeover. A
grandfather clock pensively TICKS at the end of the hall. Annie remains
relentlessly optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: First impressions?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: It’s perfect. Annie places the fruit basket
on the dining table and begins turning on the lights.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s one word for it. Stewing, John exits
into the hall with his duffel bag. Annie reads the strained dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I feel your pain. I have a daughter his age.
Apparently, I ruin her life on a daily basis. John steps back in,
holding a sun-faded poster featuring NFL great Bernie Kosar.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This guy was covering a hole in my wall.
Annie’s cheeks blush with annoyance.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I told the handyman to patch that before you
arrived. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Don’t you worry about it. She nods,
grateful.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: We’ll knock it off the rent. Keep the poster,
Bernie Kosar brings good luck here in the Buckeye State.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s the last of them. I’m hitting the
sack.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I need a new photo first. John crosses and
stands against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Say Paradise. John gives him a withering
look. Henri flashes off a shot. The camera is cabled to one of the
laptops.</p>
<p><strong>tight on laptop</strong>: The image of John pixelates onto a
digital grid and a face-recognition program begins to map his facial
structure. Henri turns to another laptop.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I’ve imputed the new search words: Daniel
Jones. Big Pine Key. Sunset High School. You think of any others?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, this place sucks.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: If there’s a story or picture of you on the
internet, this program will find it. Our enemy doesn’t know who you are
– I want to keep it that way. John nods, knows he’s being a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sand Dollar Beach, that’s where we were jet
skiing. Henri types it in when something SCRATCHES at the door. Their
heads instantly turn towards the sound. Tense SILENCE. SLOW PUSH IN ON
THE DOOR as another SCRATCH echoes. Henri is on his feet. He flicks off
the lights and silently signals John to retreat down the hall. With the
cool air of an assassin, Henri unzips a duffel bag and pulls out a sleek
crystal-handled dagger. As he steps to the door…</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I found our intruder – he’s a little small
for a Mogadorian. At that moment,</p>
<p><strong>a beagle</strong>: slips between Henri’s legs. It cocks its
head, studies John’s face, then pads forward and licks his cheek.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s starving, doesn’t have any collar or
tags.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Must have been dumped.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know, another pair of eyes and ears
watching the house wouldn’t be a bad thing. Henri considers the request,
nods. John playfully ruffles the dog’s head.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: What are you going to call him?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Since I need all the luck I can get – how
about Bernie Kosar?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wow. You outdid yourself. What’s up? Henri
lifts a red backpack into view. John stares at it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I already have a backpack.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: This one has five days of rations, spare
clothes, cash and a handheld GPS. Keep it with you at all times.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Henri, come on.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Game’s changed. You’re in the crosshairs now.
You have to be ready to leave at a moment’s notice. With or without me.
John stares at the backpack, takes in this new reality. He pushes the
plate away, snatches the backpack and heads out the door. Henri stares
at the omelette, tastes a pinch of hash browns, then puts the plate on
the floor on his way out. It takes Bernie 2.5 seconds to race over and
start to eat.</p>
<p><strong>bernie kosar.</strong>: The little dog is sitting by the
flagpole wagging his white- tipped tail. John crosses to him,
baffled.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bernie, what the hell… were you hiding in the
car? He scoops the dog into his arms.</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Hey, I was about to take a picture of
the little guy. John turns and finds</p>
<p><strong>sarah harte.</strong>: She’s his age and is holding an old
35mm Nikon. There is something about her unforced beauty that is
instantly enchanting. John shuffles, uncharacteristically nervous.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s not supposed to be here.</p>
<p>****: Go home. Now. Bernie hops out of his arms and obediently runs
towards home.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He’s really well-trained. How long have you
had him? John turns away.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sorry about your shot.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No worries. He begins walking towards the
entrance.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You just moved into the house on Old Mill
Road. It’s John, right?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m not stalking you. My mom
said she rented it to a guy with a son my age. Since I know every other
face on this quad, that had to be you.</p>
<p>****: I’m Sarah. He nods.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Someplace warmer.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t think that qualifies as an actual
answer.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need to register. She raises her camera to
snap a shot of him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whoa. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Capturing your first day, even though you’re
technically six weeks late.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Please don’t point that at me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Afraid the camera’s going to steal your soul?
She lifts the viewfinder to her eye, adjusts focus. Annoyed, he covers
the lens with his hand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s your problem? I said no.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s only for the yearbook. John regains his
composure.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not big into having my picture taken.
Sorry. As he heads away, Sarah watches, intrigued. CAMERA TRACKS TO
REVEAL MARK JAYNE monitoring the encounter. He’s the star quarterback
and his chiselled jaw tenses with jealousy.</p>
<p><strong>a backpack</strong>: viciously sideswipes him. The textbooks
scatter across the checkerboard linoleum. John sees the culprit is Mark
Jayne, who offers him a taunting grin. John fights his urge to react and
watches as Mark struts over to his POSSE OF JOCKS.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Welcome to Paradise, irony not included. John
looks at the teen standing two lockers down. He’s got a battered
skateboard tucked into his backpack and wears an Army surplus jacket.
This is SAM GOODE – genius by birth, slacker by choice. He nods after
Mark.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: His name’s Mark Jayne. Quarterback, sheriff’s
son, he’s three years into the best four years of his life. John begins
retrieving the fallen books. Sam helps.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Do yourself a favor – stay off his radar.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Didn’t know I was on it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You were talking to Sarah Harte.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She was talking to me.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mark and Sarah have been exclusive since
Freshmen year.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: If there’s another guy in her airspace, he
shoots them down. You got a warning shot. John piles the books into his
locker.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Maybe I’ll fire back next time.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Look, you’re new, so let me tell you how things
work in this misnamed backwater. Football players are gods – the rest of
us are mere mortals. If you want to survive, keep your head down and
don’t make waves.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You sound like my dad.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Obviously a wise man.</p>
<p>****: I’m Sam by the way. Sam extends his hand. John doesn’t take
it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks for the download. As he SLAMS his
locker shut…</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Alright, people. Let’s hit the gym. The
assembled teens GROAN and fan off towards the mouth of a tunnel that
stares out from the base of the bleachers.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Okay, half court, three on three. Girls have
this basket, boys have that one.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: Two simultaneous games are in progress.
John sits on the sidelines waiting his turn. He avoids eye contact with
Sarah who is sitting in the shadow of the basket. However, he does
notice Mark Jayne enter and approach her.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: New kid, you’re up. Show me what you’ve got.
John steps onto the court and waits for the ball to come his way. He
steals a glance and sees Sarah and Mark arguing. A blur of orange. John
swings back and catches the ball. Just as he shoots, he’s distracted by
Sarah’s upset voice.</p>
<p><strong>the shot</strong>: goes wild, misses the basket but hits the
glass backboard with such force that it</p>
<p><strong>shatters.</strong>: Mark and Sarah are inadvertently forced
to separate as shards rain down. All eyes turn to John, who’s annoyed at
his momentary lapse. TEENS HOOT. The Coach BLOWS his whistle.</p>
<p><strong>coach</strong>: Enough! Hit the showers.</p>
<p>****: LeBron, grab a broom. As the gym empties, John looks over and
catches Sarah watching him. OFF this silent exchange…</p>
<p><strong>the intricately carved box</strong>: is clutched in Henri’s
hands. He heads down the hall and stops in front of the grandfather
clock. Its tarnished pendulum sways. He unlocks the glass panel and
slots the Box out of sight behind the clock’s brass face.</p>
<p><strong>bernie kosar.</strong>: The dog is studying him with his head
cocked.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Let’s keep this our little secret. OFF
Bernie’s inquisitive eyes…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: First day here and you’re already destroying
school property. So much for not making waves. John moves past him and
grabs a tray. He’s flushed and his face is now hot and red.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I hear the real spectator sport was Mark and
Sarah’s blowout. John wipes his brow, distracted.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Dude, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fine. At that moment, Mark Jayne and his
buddy, KEVIN, cut in front of them. Annoyed, John taps Mark on the
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You got a problem?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Line starts back there.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Football players get priority.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where’s that posted?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Unwritten rule.</p>
<p>****: I’m surprised your boyfriend didn’t tell you. Sam puts his
hands up and backs away. Mark smirks at John.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: If you don’t know your place around here,
things can get rough. John holds his ground.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: In that case, I guess I better ask you where I
should sit. I was thinking about grabbing that chair next to your
girlfriend. In a flash of anger, Mark whips up his tray, hammers it into
John’s chest, knocking him to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You want to talk trash? Let’s see you back it
up. John tries to stand, but is suddenly overcome with a wave of pain.
He looks down at his hands and is alarmed to see</p>
<p><strong>light</strong>: blooming from his palms! He quickly balls
them into fists, extinguishing the light from view.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Get up! SILENCE has fallen. Still clenching
his fists, John rises and stumbles out into the hall. OFF Sarah’s
concern as she watches him exit…</p>
<p><strong>the grandfather clock.</strong>: A shaft of white light
blooms from within. The shadow of the swaying pendulum cuts across
Henri’s face. As he sprints for the door…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Dude, hold up! John leans against the wall,
keeping his hands out of sight.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You look like crap. I’ll get the nurse. But as
Sam runs off, John heads in the other direction.</p>
<p><strong>it’s henri.</strong>: John looks at him, confusion and fear
etched on his face.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Henri, what’s happening to me?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Calm down. You’re going to be okay. John
angrily holds up one of his luminescent hands.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: On what planet is this okay?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Yours.</p>
<p>****: I need to get you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, start talking. What the hell’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Your first Legacy is starting to
manifest.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Legacy?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: An extraordinary ability. Yours is called
Lumen. They start a lot sooner on Lorien. I was beginning to fear yours
would never emerge.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You knew this was going to happen? Why didn’t
you say anything?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I didn’t want to worry you. You were already
under enough pressure.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry. John acknowledges the apology, but looks at him,
suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What else have you been hiding from me?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: This couldn’t be opened until your first
Legacy appeared. Ready? John nods nervously. Henri places the fingertips
of his right hand onto five petal-shaped discs inlaid onto the lid. John
cautiously follows suit and places his fingers on the “petals” fanned
across the opposite side.</p>
<p><strong>the discs</strong>: momentarily glow and a SHARP CLICK echoes
from within. John and Henri pull their hands away and watch as the Box
miraculously comes to life. Fissures of light sweep across the lines of
inlaid stone, dividing the lid into sections that begin to twist and
reform like high-tech origami.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whoa. PUSH IN ON Bernie as he sits up and
watches the Box unfold. Like an intricate jigsaw, the sections finally
regroup, creating a new pattern on the lid. It’s a familiar geometric
symbol. John touches the crystal pendant that hangs from his neck – the
symbols are an exact match.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Open it. John nods, cautiously lifts the lid,
revealing a neat assortment of velvet pouches and an array of colored
rocks. They range in size and color but all share a serene beauty.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Crystals from Lorien’s core. They’ll guide us
in your training. John tries to reach for one, but Henri slaps his hand
away.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Place your hand over them. John follows the
instruction and is amazed when a walnut- sized crystal floats up from
the Box. It slowly begins to spin and project</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Our solar system. Henri points to a planet.
Its oceans are dark with pollution and its sprawling continents are
barren and treeless.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: That’s what Lorien looked like thousands of
years ago. We had all the problems that Earth has today. The planet was
dying until our people made a collective decision to change and slowly
Lorien began to heal itself – that’s when the Legacies started. John
watches as the spinning planet transforms before his eyes. Its oceans
turn a vibrant chroma-key blue and the land masses become a lush emerald
green.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Only a select few developed these abilities.
They became known as the Garde.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s what I am?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Like your parents and grandparents. John
considers this new information.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The other children in the ship… Henri finishes
John’s thought.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: They’re Garde as well. Once you’ve mastered
your Legacies, we’ll find them and face the Mogadorians together. John
looks at Henri, curious.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What Legacy do you have?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I don’t have any and never will. I’m your
Cepan – a teacher. My job is not just to protect you but to train
you.</p>
<p>****: Give me your hand. Henri takes one of John’s hands and pulls a
cigarette lighter from his pocket. John flinches, unsure.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Trust me. Henri flicks a flame to life and
sweeps it under John’s outstretched palm.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You feel that? Amazingly, the flame
harmlessly licks the skin. But when Henri moves the lighter further up
John’s arm –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ouch. John jerks his hand away. Henri kills
the flame, shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: When we’re done, your entire body will be
shielded against fire. John rubs his singed wrist.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You’ll get other Legacies too.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Flying would be cool.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You don’t get to pick them off a menu. KNOCK.
KNOCK. KNOCK. As John spins to the door, the shimmering galaxy fades and
the crystal drops to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Mogs don’t knock.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: It’s a girl. John looks over his shoulder and
reacts with surprise.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How’d you do it? Her accusation startles
him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Eviscerate the entire senior class? She pulls
a strip of overexposed 35mm film from her coat.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I was in the darkroom before lunch and they
were hanging on the line smiling and looking forward to the future. When
I got back, I found 15 rolls of negatives wiped clean. John shrugs
innocently.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So you weren’t in the darkroom today?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Here’s a tip. If you’re going to lie, don’t
leave a big red backpack at the scene of the crime. She swings his
backpack into view. John is mortified. He struggles to find a plausible
answer and silently tries to quell the feeling welling in his chest.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know what happened. Maybe it’s a sign
that you should invest in a digital camera.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Digital sucks. Film tells the truth. Clearly,
I’m not going to get that from you. He watches as she angrily heads down
the steps and climbs into her car. John glances at his palms and is
surprised to find they are dimly luminescent.</p>
<p><strong>mark jayne</strong>: is behind the wheel and watches as her
headlights fade into the night. OFF his simmering jealousy…</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She was returning my backpack. He dumps it by
the door.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I think you should stay home from school for
a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Just to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m going for a run. Bernie trots out and wags
his tail pleadingly.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sorry, buddy, you couldn’t keep up.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: John moves at superhuman speed, leaving a
blurring wake of leaves. His foot splits a log as he bounds over it.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: John charges towards a secluded stream.
It’s 30 feet wide. He doesn’t slow, leaps off the bank and effortlessly
hopscotches from boulder to boulder to the other side.</p>
<p><strong>the eagle</strong>: alights in a nearby oak tree. John bends
to tighten his laces, his eyes fall on the trio of scars branded on his
ankle. His happiness dims.</p>
<p><strong>angle on ball</strong>: It arcs up, sails right over the
garage and drops earthwards in the heart of the woods. Unperturbed by
the superhuman throw, Bernie hightails after the ball. Henri steps out
and watches, amused, then tosses John a pair of black driving gloves.
OFF John’s eye roll…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: disappearing into a room at the end. He’s
torn, then makes a decision and does something he shouldn’t – he strides
down the hall after her.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I think you have the wrong room. She rises,
walks past him and begins searching the photos scattered on the layout
table in the middle of the space.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wanted to apologize.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Does the apology come with an explanation? He
turns to go, has his hand on the door when –</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Wait. He looks back. Her face softens.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: How about we delete Monday and start over?
She steps forward and extends her hand.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: John. TIGHT ON THEIR HANDS as they shake. She
checks out his fingerless gloves, amused.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Nice gloves. She crosses to the board,
reaches down to lift it when John steps behind her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know all these people? She nods.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Curse of a small town. I’ve been around them
my whole life. Kim Thomas. She peed in her bed at a sleepover when we
were seven.</p>
<p>****: Neil Bailey. President of the Debate Club. Plays five
instruments. Doesn’t know he’s gay yet.</p>
<p>****: Mrs. Ross. AP English. She’s been here so long, she taught my
mom and my four brothers. I’m the baby of the family in case you were
wondering. Her curious eyes scour his face.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So what’s your story?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not very interesting.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Determined to keep the mystery alive, aren’t
you? His finger arrows in on a photograph of Sarah. It’s a candid and
she’s taking a shot with her trademark Nikon.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Okay. Recovering cheerleader. Wannabe
vegetarian but I still love burgers. Dreams of being a
photojournalist.</p>
<p>****: I’ve never actually admitted that last one to anybody
before.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Your secret’s safe with me. She studies him,
sensing a kindred spirit.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You ever feel you don’t belong in your own
life?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Every single day.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Wow. That almost sounded like a straight
answer. They look at each other. There’s a charged silence. The moment
is broken when –</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: What’s he doing in here? John and Sarah spin
to find Mark. Sarah is flustered.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I thought you were on two-a-days.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Coach wants me to rest my arm before the
scouts come. You didn’t answer my question?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John was helping me move some boards. John
turns to Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m going to take off. Mark doesn’t take his
eyes off John and blocks his way.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Seriously, Sarah, what’s up with this guy?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t have time for this, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: But you had time to go to his house the other
night. Sarah looks at him, stunned by the admission.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You were following me?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Just trying to figure out what’s going on with
you. Sarah’s shock turns to anger.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’ve crossed so many lines I can’t even
speak to you right now. She hustles out of the room. Mark glares at
John.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: This isn’t over. OFF John, unmoved by the
threat…</p>
<p><strong>a teen girl.</strong>: kneels in front of John’s old desk
searching the drawers. She wears a biker jacket, combat boots and has a
striking “don’t-fuck-with-me” face. Frustrated in her search, she flings
the desk against the wall. It splinters on impact.</p>
<p><strong>kabbboooooom!</strong>: The house detonates. The concussive
force of the blast rips the structure right off its stilts. Tornadoes of
flame BLAST through the windows as the house catapults into the air.
Orange reflections flicker on the Girl’s visor as she flips it down,
REVS the motorcycle and SCREAM-PEELS down the drive backlit by the
glittering inferno…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nice freakout the other day.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wasn’t feeling well. They twist their
combination locks. Sam swings open his door, there’s a HISSING POP
and</p>
<p><strong>a red ink pack explodes.</strong>: It’s the kind banks use to
foil heists. In a shocking instant, Sam and the contents of his locker
are splattered. It bears a gruesome resemblance to arterial spray.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: has his door halfway open and ducks back a
second before the ink pack planted in his locker ERUPTS. The spray
misses his face but violently spits across his chest and arms. LAUGHTER
echoes behind them. John spins and finds Mark and his posse. TIGHT ON
John’s hands as he balls them and an angry glow flickers through his
gloves.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Told you it wasn’t over. Behind them, Sam’s
laid-back persona cracks. He frantically clears his locker, looking for
something. He finally pulls out a photo which drips with ink, reels at
the jocks.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Assholes. John looks back at Sam. Mark seizes
his chance and launches a sucker-punch at John. But John sees it out of
the corner of his eye and in a blur of motion whips up his hand and</p>
<p><strong>catches mark’s fist.</strong>: John squeezes it vice-tight.
Mark grimaces in agony. His buddies back into the CROWD OF TEENS that
has gathered. John leans in close.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That sensation you’re feeling – remember it.
With a quick push, John shoves Mark back against the lockers. Mark DENTS
a door and slides to the floor, his eyes flaring with lacerated
pride.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Show’s over. The crowd disperses. Mark gets to
his feet and exits with his friends, but shoots John one final wounded
glare…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I raided lost and found. He holds up a
puke-green sweater decorated with red snowmen. John turns back to the
sink.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know. Nobody loses anything cool. He sits and
begins to change.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Dude, the way you thrashed Mark back there.
Awesome move. John acknowledges that with a nod. Whip-dries his shirt.
Sam plucks up the photo. The ink is now dried and cracked.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Who’s in the picture? Sam stares at it,
nostalgic.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: My dad. My real dad. I took it the summer
before he split.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He dragged me and my mom all over the Yucatan.
He was looking for evidence of ancient astronauts. All I got was
Montezuma’s Revenge.</p>
<p>****: Sounds like a fun vacation.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I know. Insane. He called himself an
anthropologist even though he only made it through one semester of
college. He rises and tosses the ruined picture into the trash.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Always thought he’d come back one day – who was
I kidding. The guy’s a joke. As the BELL RINGS…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John. He turns in surprise as Sarah
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I heard about the lockers. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll live. He starts off again.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I broke up with Mark. He stops, slowly turns
back.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ve been thinking about doing it for a
while… today just finally pushed me over the edge.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why are you telling me? She bows her head,
suddenly embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You made the right call. The certainty of his
voice soothes her. She looks up and holds his gaze. Their attraction is
undeniable.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Halloween Block Party’s tonight.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I saw the banners.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ll be on Main Street hiding behind my
camera if you want to swing by. He says nothing.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I wasn’t expecting an actual response. I
could text you later. Do they have cell phones on Planet John? She holds
out her phone. John looks at it tentatively, then takes it. As he inputs
his number, he hears the BLARE of a car horn, looks up and sees Henri
waiting in his SUV.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Wasn’t that your friend from the other
night?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Her name’s Sarah.</p>
<p>****: I didn’t ask for a ride home.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Principal called. Said there was an
incident.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: A guy was messing with me. I took care of it.
Problem solved.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You’re stronger and faster because of Earth’s
gravity – you shouldn’t use that advantage to settle petty scores.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It was no big deal. Don’t blow it out of
proportion.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You can’t risk everything over wounded
pride.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I wasn’t looking for a fight. It just
happened. Get off my back. Henri pulls a printout from his coat. John
unfolds it.</p>
<p><strong>angle on printout</strong>: It’s from the Florida Keynoter
website and features a photo of the charred stilt house. John’s gut
churns as he stares at the image.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Article says it was arson.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We were clean. There’s no way the Mogs can
track us here. Henri shakes his head, shifts into gear and starts
off.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: They can track us anywhere. I think it’s time
you saw what you’re really up against.</p>
<p><strong>one rises.</strong>: It’s white and as thick as two fingers.
It floats in front of John’s face. He tentatively reaches out. When he
grips it, a shock wave of light blasts out, totally WIPING OUT THE FRAME
and transporting him into</p>
<p><strong>an armada of battleships</strong>: eclipsing Lorien’s two
moons. The angular hulls of the craft are scarred from galactic battles
new and ancient and unleash an endless crisscrossing FRENZY OF
MISSILES.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>footsteps echo!</strong>: Young John and his grandfather
scramble across the space and straight into the path of</p>
<p><strong>two mogadorian soldiers.</strong>: The Soldiers’ pallid faces
flash with smiles. Swords drawn, they move in for the kill when one is
skewered in the throat by a crystal-handled dagger.</p>
<p><strong>a cloaked figure.</strong>: It’s a violent battle of wills
which ends when the Cloaked Figure kicks up the dead Soldier’s sword and
impales it into the Mogadorian’s chest. The Soldier EVISCERATES in a
cloud of HISSING cinders. Young John watches in awed terror as the
Cloaked Figure steps towards him and pulls back his hood.</p>
<p><strong>it’s henri.</strong>: He looks younger, the years of hiding
have aged him. John’s grandfather lifts a familiar crystal pendant from
his neck and places it over Young John’s head.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: This is your Cepan. Go with him.</p>
<p><strong>young john</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Your life is my life now. I will always
protect you.</p>
<p>****: He must survive. A BLAST scorches across the space. Henri
spots</p>
<p><strong>a mogadorian commander</strong>: hunkered behind a column,
his red coat billows behind him like a curse.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: They are already hunting you! Go! Henri
plucks a crystal ankle-dagger from his boot, grabs young John and
charges up. As the Commander breaks cover, Henri hurls the dagger.</p>
<p><strong>the commander</strong>: dives out of its path but ROARS as
the blade SPARK-RIPS across his right cheek like a hot poker.</p>
<p><strong>a mogadorian transport craft</strong>: suddenly swoops
between them. The HOWLS of its occupants ricochet through the night. The
heat from its engines washes the ground, warping the destruction like a
ghastly mirage as two bay doors open. Young John looks back through the
heat- haze and catches a impressionistic view as</p>
<p><strong>two piken</strong>: leap out. Their reptilian bodies ripple
with muscle and their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws. The
Piken mercilessly rip into John’s grandfather. Young John races to help,
but Henri wrenches him back. CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT ON YOUNG JOHN’S FACE
as he screams…</p>
<p><strong>young john</strong>: Nooooooooooo! THE MEMORY ENDS and
we…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nooooooooooo! He drops the crystal and
stumbles back. The experience has left him traumatized. Henri steps
towards him, but John is too overwhelmed and runs out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I saw my grandfather. I saw what you did to
the Mogadorians – you saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: A lot of Lorics sacrificed their lives so
that you could live.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He said I must survive.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: The Elders had a plan. You weren’t on that
ship by chance. The nine of you were chosen for a reason. Even if only
two of you live, together you’ll pose a grave threat to our enemy.
Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You saw what they did to Lorien. How can nine
or six or two of us take on that army? It’s hopeless. Henri knows he has
to pull him out of this mournful funk.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I never thought we’d get off Lorien alive –
but we did. I didn’t know how we could survive on a strange planet – but
we have. I gave us six months before the Mogs found us – it’s been 10
years. Don’t give up now. Henri grips John’s shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You have the potential to do great things.
Even if you don’t see it – I do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How can you put so much faith in me?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Because your life is my life. If you quit,
then everything I’ve worked for and sacrificed is meaningless.</p>
<p>****: Remember – nothing is inevitable. The fragile SILENCE is broken
when John’s cell phone BLEATS. He scans a text.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s Sarah. The Block Party’s tonight. I’ll
say I can’t make it. Henri sees John is wracked with doubt and
confusion.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: No… go. John looks at him, surprised by this
paternal gesture.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You’ve had enough for one day.</p>
<p><strong>a slap on glass.</strong>: John turns and is amused to find
Sam standing among the mannequins in the display window of a sporting
goods store.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You work here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Not by choice. Ed’s my stepdad. He’s under the
delusion that if people eat enough candy apples and kettle corn, they’ll
suddenly have the urge to buy sporting goods. John plucks a hockey mask
from the basket on the counter.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I put those on special tonight for any wannabe
Jason Voorhees. Sam pulls off his apron, revealing a T-shirt emblazoned
with the words “Future Supervillain”.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Screw this. Let me lock up. I’ll hang with you.
He steps to the door and twists the closed sign into view.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What about your stepdad?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He hit the tavern at 6:00. He’s already
hammered by now. I’ll probably find him passed out on the doorstep.
Every night is trick ’r treat at my house.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She’s over there. John follows Sam’s gaze and
finds Sarah taking shots of some KIDS dunking for apples. She pulls the
camera from her eye, sees John and smiles as he approaches.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You made it. Like the T-shirt, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Guidance Counsellor said I need to set goals
for myself. Figured I’d aim high. She looks back at John.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What do you think of Halloween in Paradise?
John regards a particularly over-the-top float.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They should pull out all the stops next
year.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Well, you haven’t had the full experience
until you’ve been on the Haunted Hayride.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Give me a sec. She steps to the face-painting
booth. It’s sponsored by the local realtor who is Sarah’s mom, Annie.
Sarah hands Annie her camera. Sam whispers to John.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m impressed. Before John can respond, Sarah
steps back.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You guys ready?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Three on a wagon might get a little crowded.
I’ll meet you two on the other side. He gives John a not-so-subtle wink
of encouragement. John and Sarah join the end of the line and watch Sam
head away.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sam’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Definitely unique.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I haven’t really talked to him since 8th
grade. Mark had a tight circle. If you weren’t a jock or cheerleader,
you didn’t exist.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m glad you broke free.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Me too. OFF their growing connection…</p>
<p><strong>ominous pov</strong>: WATCHES from the trees as a wagon with
John and Sarah RATTLES into view. It’s driven by the GRIM REAPER.</p>
<p><strong>five giant rubber spiders</strong>: drop from the trees.
Sarah freaks as the arachnids dangle over their heads on wires. She rubs
her hair, flustered, looks over at John, who is coolly amused by the
cheap scares.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Not even a flinch. None of this scares you,
does it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m trembling on the inside. He smiles.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You can smile. I was starting to have my
doubts. She takes his hand. They CLATTER past a series of grisly</p>
<p><strong>tableaux:</strong>: A TEEN jerks and SCREAMS in mock agony as
he is fried in an antiquated electric chair. A BLOOD-SPLATTERED DOCTOR
CACKLES as he hacksaws the legs off a CHEERLEADER chained to a gurney. A
squad of blood-hungry VAMPIRIC FOOTBALL PLAYERS attacks a rival team of
WEREWOLVES.</p>
<p><strong>grim reaper</strong>: Hell’s Gate, everybody off. The duo
reluctantly clambers off the back and watches as the hay wagon circles
back the way it came.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Once we make it through, we’re home free.</p>
<p><strong>a skeleton</strong>: pendulums in front of them. Sarah
SCREAMS and clenches John’s hand harder. A pathway of lights floods on,
illuminating a skull-capped gate. The words</p>
<p><strong>two chainsaw-wielding zombies</strong>: burst through the
gates behind them. The teens take off. It’s like a flickering scene from
a demented silent movie. The Zombies have almost caught up when the
strobe abruptly ends. The SOUND of the chainsaws FADES and John and
Sarah stop, panting and LAUGHING with relief.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That was insane.</p>
<p><strong>it’s pitch black.</strong>: A werewolf HOWLS somewhere in the
darkness. Something brushes past John’s leg. He spins, suddenly
unsure.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Just part of the ride. He turns, sees a flash
of purple light and hears the rustle of HEAVY FOOTSTEPS on all
sides.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you sure? As he steps forward,</p>
<p><strong>a thick branch</strong>: cuts through the dark and viciously
SMACKS John on the back. He drops to the ground like a sack. Figures
emerge from the shadows and he hears a DESPERATE STRUGGLE behind
him.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Let go! Stop it! John tries to stand, but a
boot CRACKS him in the ribs. Another strikes the side of his face. He is
surrounded. His attackers are brutal and unrelenting. Over the LOOPING
SOUNDTRACK OF B-MOVIE NOISES, Sarah’s muffled SCREAMS DIM.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sarah! Sa- His voice is cut off as a fist
SMASHES into his jaw and the steel cap of a combat boot SLAMS his groin.
John staggers up but is viciously kicked back to the ground. PUSH IN ON
JOHN’S FACE as it hardens with blind rage. In a blur of motion he
reaches up, grabs two of his attackers by their coats and hammers their
skulls together. As they drop, John spins to meet his other two foes
with</p>
<p><strong>blinding palms of light.</strong>: The assailants are
illuminated in the phosphorescent glare. They’re not Mogadorians but
rather</p>
<p><strong>football jocks.</strong>: One is Mark Jayne’s buddy Kevin.
They’re wearing zombie makeup and military fatigues and have
night-vision goggles strapped to their faces. John angrily strides
forward, palm outstretched.</p>
<p><strong>night-vision pov</strong>: Everything is an overexposed blur
until –</p>
<p><strong>whaaaam!!!</strong>: John brutally clotheslines one, then
pummel-rams Kevin in the chest, sending him flying back 10 feet into a
tree. Kevin slumps, out for the count. John arcs a glowing hand through
the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>sarah is gone.</strong>: He plucks up the Jocks’ fallen
goggles and heads off with Terminator-like determination.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Let go of me! She futilely tries to wrestle
free.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Help! Somebody! Something about her terrified
tone alerts Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Sarah? She doesn’t answer. He hesitates a
moment, then charges into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>sarah!</strong>: Sam turns in the direction of JOHN’S VOICE.
He’s about to head towards it when</p>
<p><strong>two zombie jocks</strong>: trudge into view. Sam darts behind
a tree. Suddenly, the area is flooded with preternatural white light. He
can hear the sounds of a SCUFFLE and one of the Jocks flies past and
CRASHES in a heap while the other SCREAMS.</p>
<p><strong>jock</strong>: You’re blinding me! Stop! Sam cautiously
sneaks a peek, shields his eyes with a hand.</p>
<p><strong>what he sees</strong>: John pins the Jock to a tree and holds
a luminous palm up to the lenses of the teen’s goggles.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where’s Sarah? Tell me!!</p>
<p><strong>jock</strong>: Shepherd Falls. Now turn off that damn
flashlight! John rips off the Jock’s goggles, then pile-slides him 15
feet into a rotten stump and takes off in a blur of speed. CAMERA STAYS
ON SAM. OFF his stunned reaction…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Are you crazy! Where’s John? Mark nods the
Zombie Jocks away.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Relax. It’s a practical joke.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I swear if you hurt him –</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Why do you give a shit?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Get out of my face, Mark, you’re
pathetic.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’m the best thing that ever happened to you
and I’m giving you one more chance. Appalled by his hubris, Sarah turns
to leave.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Don’t walk away from me! Mark grabs her. Sarah
wrenches free, but loses her balance and falls back on the ground.
Mark’s rage is transplanted by concern. He steps towards her to help
when –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Back off! Mark watches John step out. Blood
trickles from a cut above John’s right eye.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John! Are you okay? He nods. Mark looks past
him, confused.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Where the hell are Kevin and Joe? John holds
up a clutch of night-vision goggles.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They got spooked.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Hey, those are police property! John flings
them over Mark’s head into the water.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’m going to kill you! With lightning speed,
John grabs Mark’s arm, spins him, pinning him to a tree. Blinded by
rage, John jerks Mark’s arm up behind his back.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John! Stop! Mark is in real pain. Transfixed
with anger, John keeps twisting. Sarah looks at him, pleading.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s his throwing arm! But he doesn’t stop
until she finally steps forward and slaps him across the face. Startled,
John lets go.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Football’s all he’s got. John stumbles back,
ashamed, and heads into the woods. Sarah offers Mark a look of disgust
and follows after John.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John! Wait. Sarah catches up.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t want you to break his
arm.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not mad at you. I’m mad at myself. She
stops, faces him.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I had no idea Mark would pull something like
that. He has seriously gone off the deep end.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The guy’s in love with you. Wants you
back.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: That’s not love. Their eyes meet in the
moonlight.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Walk me home?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: This is me. John stares at the dozen
jack-o’-lanterns arranged on the porch. They glare back with flickering
bucktooth grins.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I know. Wait until the Christmas decorations
go up. My mom decks the halls with so many lights, you can see our house
from space. Stray TRICK-OR-TREATERS race past. She motions to the cut
above his eye, concerned.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You should see a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: For this? Wouldn’t waste their time. She looks
at him, curious.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You’re not going to tell me how you took out
those football players, are you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I really don’t get you. She steps closer.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: But I feel like I can trust you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You can. The air is charged.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Good night. Sarah swings open the white
picket gate.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wait. As she turns back, John steps forward
and kisses her. Although taken by surprise, Sarah quickly succumbs to
his passion. However, as their kiss intensifies,</p>
<p><strong>the jack-o’-lanterns</strong>: rise and hover in midair.
Sarah has her back to them, but when John’s eyes momentarily flicker
open, he sees the orbs grinning back. Startled, he pulls away from
her.</p>
<p><strong>the pumpkins</strong>: instantly drop and SMASH onto the
porch, their candles blowing out on impact. Sarah spins and stares at
the jack-o’- lanterns, pulp oozes through their cracked shells.
Suspicious, she slowly turns, looks at John for an explanation. He does
his best to cover his stunned reaction. Fat drops of RAIN begin to fall.
John puts up his hood.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I better go. OFF Sarah, watching him melt into
the downpour…</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I heard on the police scanner that eight boys
were beaten up in the woods tonight. Henri turns on a light, nursing a
mug of coffee. Bernie wakes. John pulls off his hood. Henri looks at the
cuts and bruises on John’s face.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They won’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: That was a stupid thing to do. What were you
thinking?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They attacked me. If I hadn’t defended myself,
I’d be in the ER right now. Would that have been the better choice?</p>
<p>****: You’ve got to start trusting me! Emotionally charged, John
points his finger at Henri, accidentally causing the mug to
telekinetically</p>
<p><strong>explode.</strong>: Coffee and shards splatter across the
floor. Henri looks at John, stunned. John shrugs sheepishly.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was getting to that. I got a new Legacy.
Henri absorbs that revelation.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Telekinesis. That’s a big step. Must have
been triggered by the fight. John doesn’t correct him, averts his
gaze.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I need to teach you how to control these
abilities. We’ll start working on that tomorrow. The conversation is
suddenly interrupted by the repetitive WHINE OF AN ALARM. They cross to
the bank of computers. Henri urgently stabs commands into a
keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What is it? Henri pulls up a website.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: We got a hit on one of the search words.</p>
<p>****: It’s a paranormal blog. “They Walk Among Us!”</p>
<p><strong>angle on computer</strong>: A video buffers into motion. It’s
handheld and jerky. It WHIP-PANS over some sand and joins a group of
Teens huddled over a figure lying in the surf. He’s holding his ankle
and light seeps between his fingers. John’s chest pounds with fear as he
realizes…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s Sand Dollar Beach.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Looks like a cell phone camera. There’s
enough for the Mogs to ID your face.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can you take it down? Henri remains ice calm
and starts typing commands.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Working on it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sorry, Henri.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: This isn’t your fault. There’s still nothing
to trace us here. Henri glances up from his screen.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: This could take all night. Get some
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>2nite. my garage.”</strong>: JOHN hits delete and clenches
the phone in his palm. A bad night just got worse.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: blur ACROSS THE FRAME of one of the
surveillance camera screens and disappear into the woods.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’ve narrowed it down to three possibilities:
you’re a genetic experiment, you’re a freak of nature, or you’re an
extraterrestrial.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know what you think happened tonight…
Sam steps closer, watery reflections ripple down his face.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Your hands lit up like a firefly on crack, you
tossed those football players around like crash test dummies, and you
took off faster than an Olympic runner.</p>
<p>****: Did I leave anything out? John silently reels.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I just want to know who you are. John looks at
Sam, realizes he’s not going to give up. He hesitates, then finally
surrenders…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m a survivor from a planet called Lorien.
Sam absorbs this confession with awe.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Your dad… he’s from there too?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Henri’s not my dad. He’s my Guardian. If he
found out you knew about us, we’d be gone by morning.</p>
<p>****: I don’t want to leave Paradise.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I won’t tell anyone. John nods, grateful.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: There’s something I want to show you.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The tarp is whipped off the pickup truck.
It’s an old Ford. Sam and John stand before it.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The cops found it abandoned in the middle of
Route 20, just south of White Sands, New Mexico. It was my dad’s. He
went missing six years ago. He was on one of his crazy fact-finding
trips. He believed we weren’t alone in the universe. Sam rubs his hand
across the hood, wondering.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Mom figured he was having an affair and took
off. All these years I thought she was right. Now you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That doesn’t prove anything.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: It proves he wasn’t crazy. I’m starting to
think that he didn’t bail on us… that maybe something else happened out
there – that he was taken. The moment is broken by the SLAM of the front
door and the sound of ANGRY FOOTSTEPS. Sam instantly tenses.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Guess the bar closed.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: Sam! Where are you? His speech is slurred and
aggressive.</p>
<p><strong>ed</strong>: You think I wouldn’t hear you locked up early!
John looks at Sam, shocked and concerned.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: If he finds you here, it’ll be worse.</p>
<p>****: Go. Sam crosses to the door leading into the main house and
heads inside. SHOUTS erupt almost immediately. John flinches, wanting to
intervene, but finally turns, hustles under the garage door and slips
into the night…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You look wiped. Henri turns and smiles
playfully.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I wasn’t the only who was up last night. John
nervously hands Henri one of the cups and lies…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sarah texted me. I went over to her house.
Henri buys the explanation and swings back to his computers.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I’ve tried every trick I know, but I can’t
crack that blog’s firewall.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There must be a way.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: We need to find where the site’s located and
take it offline manually. The URL source has been run through a
labyrinth of servers, it could take weeks to track down.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I want to help. Henri takes a gulp of coffee
and stands.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You can. Get changed.</p>
<p><strong>reverse to reveal</strong>: She is watching the cell phone
footage of John on the “They Walk Among Us” blog.</p>
<p><strong>stop in midair.</strong>: It’s like they’ve hit an invisible
wall two feet from his hand. They hang there. John sees a smile sneak
onto Henri’s face and momentarily loses focus, causing the wall to
collapse and the balls to drop into the mud.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t see any family pictures around. I
guess the photo aversion is hereditary. He greets the observation with a
shrug. She carries on.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Your mom… grandparents. Is there anyone else
in your life?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They died.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It was a long time ago. It’s just me and my
dad now. John uses a nail brush to clean the beagle’s ears.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I get the feeling he doesn’t like me very
much.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It takes him a while to warm up to people.
Sarah considers this.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Thanksgiving’s tomorrow. Why don’t you bring
your dad and celebrate with us?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know. Are there going to be a lot of
people?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: A tsunami of relatives. But don’t worry, I’ll
shield you from the wave. Besides, I want everyone to meet you. She
playfully splashes him. Their faces inch closer. They begin making out
hot and heavy until Henri suddenly walks in.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I’ve found the – Caught in the act, the teens
lurch away from each other.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just giving Bernie a quick bath.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You’re clearly putting a lot of effort into
it.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I better hit the road.</p>
<p>****: See you tomorrow. Twoish.</p>
<p>****: Bye, Mr. Smith. OFF John as she hustles out…</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I finally tracked the location of that blog.
It’s a house in Warsaw, Indiana. About four hours from here. I’m heading
up there tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sarah invited us to Thanksgiving. I told her
we’d be there.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Send my regrets.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You shouldn’t go alone. It could be
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I won’t risk taking you. I’ll leave early and
be back by five. John looks up and sees Henri sitting in solitude.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t you ever get lonely? Surprised by the
question, Henri swivels to face him.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: How could I? I have you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know what I mean. All these years, there’s
never been anyone.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: We aren’t like humans. Once we fall in love,
it’s for life. The pain of separation is unbearable. Henri’s face clouds
with melancholy and he abruptly gets up. As he heads into the kitchen
John studies him with new eyes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What was her name? Henri slots a plate onto
the draining board.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Anastasia.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You left her to save me.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You’re not responsible for what happened to
her – they are. He slowly turns and regards John with deep paternal
concern.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I looked at her the way you look at
Sarah.</p>
<p>****: She can’t come with us when we leave – and we always have to
leave, you know that. John nods, not wanting to deal with that
reality.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I was hoping to protect you from that
pain.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You can’t protect me from everything. OFF
Henri’s sad smile of acknowledgement…</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Come on, we’re on gravy-boat duty.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You look dazed.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just taking it all in. She crosses.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m glad you came. They tenderly kiss until
Annie bustles in carrying a steaming bowl of mashed potatoes.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Don’t mind me. She puts the bowl on the table
and grabs Sarah’s camera.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Let’s get a picture of you two lovebirds.
Sarah cringes as Annie lifts the camera to her eye.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Mom. No. John really doesn’t like having his
–</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s okay. Let her take it. The gesture means
the world to Sarah. He puts his arm around her. Sarah nestles her face
against his. As the flash WIPES</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need to check in with Henri. He exits.</p>
<p>****: Henri? CLICK. The call is hung up. Suddenly on edge, John
redials. This time it’s picked up immediately.</p>
<p>****: Henri?</p>
<p>****: Are you one of them too? John reacts to the chilling menace of
the Man’s tone.</p>
<p>****: Who are you? Where’s Henri? CLICK. John jerks the phone from
his ear and stares at it, panicked. He paces, desperate and unsure, then
gets an idea and punches another number.</p>
<p>****: I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’ll see what’s taking him so long.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John! He looks back.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s Henri. I have to go. Sorry. OFF her
confused disappointment as the truck SQUEALS away…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thanks. I owe you.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Anything to get out of Thanksgiving at my
house. He offers John a weary smile.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I checked out that blog on the way over. Saw
the video. What was the deal with your ankle? John pulls up his khakis,
shows Sam the trio of scars.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Death scars.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They kind of look like the symbols in my dad’s
research.</p>
<p>****: You guys don’t –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Abduct people? No. Irritated, he covers them
back up.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How about the ones you said were hunting
you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They’re capable of anything.</p>
<p>****: We need to get to Warsaw – now.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Number 417. Henri tracked the URL to that
house. Sam scans the street.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t see his SUV anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He would have parked it across town. Sam opens
the glove compartment and pulls out a revolver.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Stole it from Ed.</p>
<p>****: Let’s move. John yanks Sam’s arm away from the door handle.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I called you because I needed a ride, not a
sidekick. If I could have run here, I would have.</p>
<p>****: Go home. I’ll call you when I get back. OFF Sam as John climbs
out alone…</p>
<p><strong>what he sees</strong>: Take-out boxes litter the filthy
counter. The sink is swamped with dirty dishes. The light washes across
a semiautomatic sitting by a packet of Lucky Strikes.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: See anything? Annoyed, John spins and finds Sam
creeping towards him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I told you to go!</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: They might know where my dad is! John realizes
Sam is determined. He sweeps his hand back over the kitchen door. His
palm illuminates a familiar</p>
<p><strong>crystal-handled dagger.</strong>: It’s lying on the counter
by the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Henri’s here. John “turns off” his palm and
reaches for the door handle. Sam anxiously swats his arm away.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Wait! Other than strength, speed and
night-light, what powers have you got?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Telekinesis – but that’s a work in
progress.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No invisibility, X-ray vision, flight?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sam, we drove here. Sam takes a deep breath,
psyching himself up.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Okay. I’m ready. Let’s do it. But as John
reaches for the door handle, the kitchen light suddenly turns on and a
MAN enters. He’s built like a wrestler and goes by the name of
FRANK.</p>
<p><strong>sam’s lap.</strong>: He’s crouched next to John at the side
of the porch. He frantically begins trying to extinguish the stub. John
clamps his hand over Sam’s mouth and snuffs the cigarette between his
fingers. Once Frank’s safely around the corner, John releases his hand.
The duo silently climbs onto the porch. John squats in front of the
door. His hand shakes as he holds it out towards the lock and
concentrates.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. There’s a LOUD
CLICK.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You just dead bolted it! Way to go!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: New plan – follow Lucky Strike. Text me if he
comes back. Sam sneaks off after Frank.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Henri! He races over. But as he reaches for
Henri’s gag, a YOUNG MAN steps out of the shadows holding a baseball
bat. John turns too late and the bat strikes his left side. He drops the
dagger as he falls to the floor, his ribs searing. The man, BRET, raises
the bat again. John focuses his mind.</p>
<p><strong>the bat</strong>: whips out of Bret’s grip and torpedoes
towards John – who ducks out of the way as the bat flies past. Confused,
Bret lurches forward. John scrambles for the bat, clenches it in his
hand, and swings it into the young man’s legs.</p>
<p><strong>bret</strong>: knocks the light as he topples into a column
and CRASHES onto the cement, out cold. It’s over in a violent blur. John
sits stunned for a moment. The swinging bulb casts surreal shadows as he
spins back to Henri, telekinetically “unlocks” the padlock securing the
chains, and rips off the gag. Henri is groggy and his face is swollen
from brutal beatings.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You shouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Your life is my life, remember? Henri tries to
shake his drug-induced haze.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I talked my way in. Thought the big guy was
buying it. He rubs a wound on his neck.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I was asking him about the video when the
other one shot me from behind… some sort of animal tranq.</p>
<p>****: I’m getting rusty. Suddenly, John’s phone VIBRATES. It’s a
message from Sam –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We have to leave! John helps Henri up, they
race for the stairs when Bret’s hand grabs John’s ankle, tripping him to
the floor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Henri! Henri smashes his boot into Bret’s
face, knocking him out for good. John staggers up, they spin for the
stairs just as</p>
<p><strong>sam and frank</strong>: head down them into view. Frank holds
the revolver against Sam’s neck. Their shadows crisscross under the
swaying bulb.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stay planted or I’ll blow your friend’s head
off. Henri looks at John in shock.</p>
<p>****: He came to help. John and Henri put up their hands. John
focuses on the gun, but as the light bulb sweeps past, he causes it to
EXPLODE.</p>
<p><strong>the room plunges into darkness.</strong>: Henri body-slams
Frank, sending the revolver skittering. But as he wrenches Sam to
safety,</p>
<p><strong>the keys</strong>: to the pickup fly out of Sam’s pocket and
slide under the stairs. John flashes on his palm, casting everything in
eerie blue light. On all fours, Frank scrambles for the fallen weapon.
It’s almost within reach when he is lifted right off the ground by an
invisible force.</p>
<p>****: You’re the one from the video! You’re the one they’re after.
With tremendous telekinetic effort, John slams Frank against the
ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tell me what you know! Franks says nothing.
John trains his palm light on the big man’s face. It’s like a blinding
interrogation lamp.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Start talking!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t know what they’re called. The one in
the red coat said he’d kill me if I didn’t do what he wanted. This
revelation stuns Henri.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: The Mogadorians… they’ve been here? Frank
nods in terror.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He told me to call if anyone came asking
about the video. Sweat beads John’s face from the mental exertion.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p>****: They wanted me to hold your friend until they got here. Henri
urgently retrieves Sam’s gun and his dagger.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: We need to go! Now! John “releases” Frank,
who drops onto the floor like a whale and is knocked out. At that
moment, a razor-thin line of dust drops from the floorboards above.</p>
<p><strong>someone is upstairs.</strong>: John immediately extinguishes
his palm. The trio stands frozen, necks craned up, ears pricked as the
floorboards CREAK above them. They are definitely not alone.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sam, get us out of here! Sam reaches into his
jeans, then frantically checks his pockets.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I must have dropped the keys! Henri keeps his
cool, looks at John.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Start the engine.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t. Henri’s calm eyes never leave
him.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Yes, you can. John nods, puts his hand on the
dash and closes his eyes. The engine TURNS OVER but doesn’t start. Sam
looks up the street, panicked, as</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Hurry up! John’s brow is furrowed with
concentration. The Mog unsheathes his sword as he runs. With a
superhuman leap, he lands on the hood – TWAAAAACK! John and Henri spin
out of the way as the sword SHATTERS the windshield and impales in the
back of the seat, missing them by a mouse hair. As the Mogadorian
withdraws the sword to strike again, Henri sweeps up his dagger and
stakes it into the Mog’s neck.</p>
<p><strong>vrrrroommm!</strong>: The engine ROARS to life. The
Mogadorian tumbles off the hood, magenta light spurting from his wound.
John turns to Sam, who is petrified, and SCREAMS…</p>
<p><strong>drive!</strong>: Sam wrenches the shaft into gear and floors
the gas. The Mogadorian EVISCERATES in a frenzy of embers. The truck
bursts through the blizzard of sparks and STREAK-PEELS away.</p>
<p><strong>the mogadorian commander.</strong>: He’s the one who
slaughtered Number 3 in Africa. His men part as he steps into view and
crosses to Frank and Bret who are chained to chairs. A Soldier stands
behind each one. Frank looks at the Commander in terror.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I called you like I said. It’s not my fault
they got away! The Commander steps into the moonlight that seeps through
the window. We get our first good look at his face. A gnarled scar runs
down his right cheek, identifying him as the same Mogadorian Henri
wounded in the escape from Lorien. His skin is deathly pale and his eyes
have a cold purple tint.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian commander</strong>: Where did they go?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How should I know? The kid had me pinned to
the ceiling. The Commander turns to Bret.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian commander</strong>: Where did they go? Bret is too
freaked to even speak. The Commander nods to the Soldiers. They grab
Frank and Bret by the heads and yank open their mouths. Frank watches in
confused terror as the Commander holds one of the meditation balls.</p>
<p><strong>dozens of tiny razor-blades</strong>: suddenly flower open
across its surface and viciously spin. With cold-blooded calm, the
Commander drops the ball into Frank’s mouth. OFF its terrible DRILL-LIKE
WHIR…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ll meet you back at the house.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: We’re not going back to Paradise.</p>
<p>****: Thank you for your help, but you’ll never see us again. Henri
climbs out. Sam looks at John, confused.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Is he serious? John nods, numb.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What am I supposed to tell people?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing. Forget about us. We never
existed.</p>
<p>****: Goodbye, Sam. OFF Sam as John climbs out…</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: We leave at nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Henri, this is insane. They still don’t know
where we live. Henri seethes.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: It’s only a matter of time. They know our
faces. They saw Sam. How long has he known?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Since Halloween. Henri is floored and hurt by
the admission.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I trusted you and you lied to me! John bows
his head, can’t meet Henri’s gaze.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Only because I knew how you’d react and I
didn’t want to leave Paradise. Henri paces, tries to quell his
emotions.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Now we don’t have a choice. The Mogs are
using humans to trap us. From this point on – no more towns. No more
schools. We’re going off the grid until we find the others.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. His tone is defiant.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: This isn’t a discussion. In a flash of
pent-up anger, John holds up his hand and telekinetically sweeps Henri
off his feet and pins him against the wall. Henri looks at him,
stunned.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not leaving without saying goodbye to
Sarah. Henri fixes him with a steel-edged stare.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Let. Me. Down. Spent, John releases Henri who
slides to the floor, shaken. The dynamics of their relationship forever
changed. Henri finally stands.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Give me your phone and IDs. John hands him
his cell phone and wallet. Henri opens the back of the phone and pulls
out the SIM card. SNAP!</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: John Smith dies today.</p>
<p><strong>the teen girl.</strong>: She’s the one we saw in Nashville
and who torched the stilt house. Her eyes study the STREAM OF POLICE
that hustles in and out of the house carrying evidence Baggies and
equipment.</p>
<p><strong>uniform cop</strong>: The Chief wants to send the morgue boys
in and seal this tomb.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Hope they haven’t had lunch yet. These
guys were gutted from the inside out. He steps over to Frank’s body
which has been splayed open. As he flashes off some shots, the</p>
<p><strong>teen girl</strong>: appears in the corner of his viewfinder.
She’s kneeling by Frank’s severed head which has rolled a short distance
from the body. The Photographer pulls the camera away from his eye and
looks at the Teen Girl, confused.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Who the hell are you? She ignores him.
He glances at the only window which is 20 feet away on the other side of
the room.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: How’d you get in? The Girl continues
examining Frank’s wounds. Totally unnerved, the Photographer shouts up
the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Hey, we’ve got a live one down here.
When he spins back, the Girl is gone, vanished into thin air.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where is he, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I don’t know. He tries to avoid eye contact,
but she is determined.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What happened last night? I’ve tried calling
him all day. But his number’s no longer in service.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Forget about him, Sarah. Incredulous, she grabs
his arm.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m not going anywhere until you tell me
what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: He left with Henri and he isn’t coming back.
Ever.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry. OFF Sarah, shattered…</p>
<p>****: Taillights in five.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: John? No answer. He KNOCKS. Still
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>john is gone.</strong>: OFF Henri’s grim concern…</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Little late for dessert.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need to talk to Sarah.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: She’s not here. Some friends dragged her to a
party at Mark Jayne’s. John absorbs this news, turns. Annie steps out
after him.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I don’t usually pry into my daughter’s love
life, I certainly didn’t want my mother in mine – but Sarah’s my
youngest and she’s special to me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s special to me too.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You weren’t invited.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where’s Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: She doesn’t want to see you. John shoves him
aside and heads for the sweeping stairs…</p>
<p><strong>jock</strong>: Everybody upstairs! Kevin’s going for the beer
bong record! The Teens immediately bolt for the stairs. In the giddy
exodus, one of them accidentally brushes</p>
<p><strong>a candle</strong>: onto the white shag rug.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sorry about last night. She pulls away,
her relief turning to anger.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: No. Not good enough. Sam said you were never
coming back. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I couldn’t leave without seeing you one last
time. She looks at him, crushed.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So it’s true. What’s going on? What kind of
trouble are you and your dad in?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Damnit! Whatever it is, I’ll understand –
just tell me the truth.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The truth is I’m not who you think I am. You
need to forget about me. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why are you acting like this?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because it’s the only way to keep you
safe.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Safe from what? He turns away, shields her
from his torment.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Goodbye, Sarah. He doesn’t look back as he
walks out the door. CAMERA STAYS ON SARAH as she sinks onto the bed and
the dogs comfort her.</p>
<p><strong>teens</strong>: Drink! Drink! Drink! Drained and numb, John
heads the other way and fails to notice the smoke seeping from under the
basement door.</p>
<p><strong>smoke</strong>: billowing from the side of the house. He
bolts towards the front door, SCREAMS at a JOCK as he passes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Call 911! As he races inside…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sarah!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where’s Sarah?</p>
<p><strong>emily</strong>: Went back for Dozer. Another EXPLOSION rocks.
A COUPLE of drunk Jocks CHEER. John looks back at the house. The fire
has taken hold with incredible speed. The living room curtains are
ABLAZE.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: It’s too late. You can’t get through! John
ignores him and runs into the inferno.</p>
<p><strong>the staircase</strong>: is fully engulfed. Fearless, he
clambers up the flaming steps. His jeans and shirt catch fire. He’s
almost reached the top when the staircase BREAKS AWAY behind him and
DISINTEGRATES in a cloud of embers.</p>
<p><strong>craaaack!</strong>: The door rips off its hinges. Through the
smoky half-light, Sarah watches as John strides into the room,
heroically backlit by flame.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John!</p>
<p>****: Dozer’s under the bed. He’s too scared to come out! John
strides forward, grips the bed with one hand and effortlessly hoists it.
Sarah looks at him, amazed, then scrambles forward and gently scoops
Dozer into her arms. John puts the bed back down.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t let go of him. I promise I won’t let go
of you.</p>
<p><strong>a burning beam</strong>: breaks free and swings down in front
of them. Sarah SCREAMS, but watches in stunned amazement as John sweeps
it out of the way with a telekinetic flick of his hand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You okay? She stares at him, unsure.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: You walked through that fire without getting
burned. I saw you stop that beam. SIRENS wail in the distance.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll explain everything… but not here… Sarah…
please? As they take off into the woods, the IMAGE FREEZES, then
REWINDS. John and Sarah kneel in the shadows, then FLY BACKWARDS up
through the window and INTO the burning house. REVERSE TO REVEAL the
Red-Haired Teen watching playback on his FlipVideo camera, amazed. He
runs to the back of the house and finds Mark.</p>
<p>****: Check this out, man! PUSH IN as Mark stares at the footage,
stunned.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Please don’t look at me like that.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m still trying to process
everything I saw and I keep coming to the same conclusion – what you did
isn’t possible.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It is for me.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Who are you? For once please tell me the
truth. It’s the hardest thing he’s ever had to do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My name isn’t John. I don’t have a name, just
a number. 4. In fact, my whole life can be reduced to numbers: like 15
million – that’s how many light years it takes to get from my planet to
Earth. 38 – that’s how many towns I’ve lived in. Or 3,671 – that’s how
many days I’ve been running from an enemy that wants me dead. I lied to
you, Sarah, because I lie to everyone. That’s how I stay alive. Tears of
relief brim as he finally reveals his soul.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I shouldn’t be telling you any of this. It’s
dangerous. Emotionally spent, John leans against a tree. She steps
towards him and brushes her hand down his cheek.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t care. I just want to be with you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I want that too. But if I stay you could get
hurt. I have to leave to keep you safe. Sarah absorbs the bitter
reality, reaches for his hand.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: There’s something I want to give you
first.</p>
<p><strong>a photograph of sarah and john</strong>: sharpens INTO FOCUS.
It’s the one Annie took of them at Thanksgiving. John and Sarah stand in
the eerie red glow. She gently tongs the image into a bath of fixing
solution.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: So you’ll always remember me. With exquisite
tenderness they kiss. John’s palms shimmer. The intensity of the
luminescence builds with their rising passion. They sink to the floor
and the light crescendos in an ethereal flash that BLEACHES OUT THE
FRAME.</p>
<p><strong>deputy</strong>: The FBI showed up flashing their badges.
Wanna talk to you. As he points to a black SUV that’s parked down the
street.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Where are we going? Is this about the fire? It
was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>the mogadorian commander</strong>: sitting in the back. His
face is masked in shadow.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian commander</strong>: We’re hunting for one of the
guests at your party. He holds up a netbook which flashes with the
FlipVideo footage of John’s rescue of Sarah. It’s posted on YouTube.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian commander</strong>: Do you know this boy?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Yeah, John Smith. But I didn’t invite him.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian commander</strong>: He’s a fugitive. We’ve been
tracking him for some time. Mark smirks, vindicated.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’ll help you find him. He points to Sarah’s
image on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: He’s not at Sarah’s, I already checked. And
one of my dad’s deputies drove by his house – nada.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian commander</strong>: He poses a great threat to us.
Where else could he be? Mark pulls out his cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I’ve got Sarah’s cell number, maybe you guys
can trace it? The Commander takes the phone and passes it to one of his
men in the front. He looks back at Mark.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian commander</strong>: Tell me everything you know
about John Smith.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: John’s not at the house. Is he here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: No, but he’s all over the internet.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I know. He turns back to his SUV. Sam
follows.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Those things from Warsaw – they’re coming,
aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Go back inside. This isn’t your fight.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: The hell it isn’t. I’m coming with you. OFF
this declaration…</p>
<p>****: Hello. She listens, then hands John the phone.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: It’s Henri.</p>
<p>****: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: High school.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Get out now! At that moment, all the POWER in
the school DIES and the headlights of an SUV flash across the window.
Fear registers in John’s eyes as he realizes…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Too late… they’re here.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: What the hell’s in there? He looks back at the
Commander who is arming up from the trunk of the SUV. Mark glimpses the
arsenal of future-tech machine pistols, double-bladed swords and
heavy-duty daggers. He backs away in fearful realization.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: You guys aren’t FBI. Before he can run, a
Mogadorian Soldier grabs him by the neck and constrains him. The
Commander pulls</p>
<p><strong>two bandoliers</strong>: over his broad shoulders. The
cartridges are made of crystal and swirl with purple light. Finally, he
slips on his trademark red coat and spins towards the school.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian soldier</strong>: who was stalking up the hall
behind them! John watches in shock as the Mogadorian keels over and
SHATTERS into embers. John swings back to the Teen Girl as she strides
forward.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: You oughta keep your heroics off the
internet.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: Number 6. Where’s your Cepan?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: On his way. Where’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: Dead. The Mogs got her four months ago. We had
been tracking them. She heads past. John and Sarah follow after her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tracking them?</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: We discovered they plan to attack Earth. The
only thing standing in their way is the six of us. The revelation hits
John like a wrecking ball.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: You know what that means? John nods with new
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The war starts tonight.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: First we have to get out of here alive and find
the others. Six leads them past the impressive trophy case.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are we up against?</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: There’s a commander, a bunch of soldiers and
two Piken. They’ll have all the main entrances covered.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The gym, there’s a tunnel under the
stage.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’ll take us out to the stadium. Six
acknowledges that info with a curt nod. FOOTSTEPS. Six grabs John and
Sarah by their arms and yanks them back against the wall. They hold
their breath as one of the Mogadorian Soldiers prowls straight past. He
stops for a moment, then turns the corner. Sarah looks across at the
mirrored trophy case and sees there’s no reflection.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: We’re invisible. John realizes, turns to
Six.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You got any other Legacies?</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: I can control the elements. You?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lumen and telekinesis. More FOOTSTEPS. John
turns and watches in horror as the Mogadorian Commander and a trio of
Mogadorian Soldiers sweeps into view. The Commander is holding</p>
<p><strong>mark.</strong>: He is ashen with fear. Sarah has to catch
herself from screaming. John makes a move, but Six holds him in
place.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: Stay put. They want to draw you out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’s not dying because of me!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Mark! Linoleum! Now! Mark rips free and hits
the deck a second before the trophy case EXPLODES. Shards of glass rip
into the Mogadorians and trophies torpedo off the shelves and impale the
aliens against the far wall. The Mogadorians SCREAM as they flail. John,
Sarah and Six break cover. John wrenches Mark to his feet and they take
off running. They dash around the next corner and find</p>
<p><strong>henri, sam and bernie</strong>: sprinting towards them,
followed by two Mogadorians! Six raises her hand-cannon, BLOWS one of
the Mogs away, while John safely leads everybody into…</p>
<p>****: Barricade the doors! John telekinetically uproots a trio of
bookcases that fly across the space and block the door. Sarah turns to
Mark who is totally shell-shocked.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What are you doing with them?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: They said they were FBI. That John was a
fugitive. What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: You’ve stumbled into a war. So shut up and keep
your head down.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I see age hasn’t mellowed your attitude, 6.
Mark turns to John, guilt-wracked.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: I didn’t know they were trying to kill you.
I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This isn’t your fault – it’s mine. He offers
Mark his hand. Mark shakes it. Suddenly, Bernie begins to GROWL.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: What is it, boy? Henri sees where Bernie is
staring and realizes…</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: He’s telling us to run! They take off a
second before</p>
<p><strong>a piken</strong>: PUMMEL-RAMS through the wall in a shower of
bricks, books and paper. It utters a glass-shattering ROAR. John looks
back and sees Bernie bravely holding his ground.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bernie! He watches as the beagle sprints
forward and launches himself at the monster. Bernie clamps onto the
Piken’s neck. He’s hopelessly outmatched and holds on for dear life as
the Piken tries to buck him off. Then something amazing happens –</p>
<p><strong>bernie begins to morph.</strong>: He doubles, triples in size
and keeps growing. His features become reptilian, gecko-like, his fur
turns to spines and in a matter of moments Bernie has transformed into a
hulking</p>
<p><strong>alien creature.</strong>: John looks to Henri as the truth of
Bernie’s origin dawns.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Bernie’s a Chimera. He came with us from
Lorien.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Guess I wasn’t the only one keeping
secrets.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Somebody had to watch you when I wasn’t
around. They exit while Bernie and the Piken continue to battle.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The gym’s this way. A projectile HISSES past
John’s ear and DETONATES a row of lockers – BOOOOOM! – it’s like an
incendiary grenade. The paint blisters off the lockers as they are
consumed by FIRE.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: sees two Mogadorian Soldiers hauling
heavy-duty weapons that use the glass cartridges that glow on their ammo
belts. One FIRES another round. John telekinetically RIPS a door off its
hinges. It flies forward, blocks the charge and IGNITES. John spins back
and SCREAMS –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Go! Go! Go! They take off. John follows and
uses his telekinesis to fling cabinets, doors, benches anything he can
to block the fiery onslaught. But the rounds are coming too fast and a
projectile SMACKS him in the back. It’s like being hit by napalm. As
FLAMES wash across him, he looks up and snaps on</p>
<p><strong>the sprinkler heads</strong>: that run the length of the
hall. A deluge sprays, dousing the fire. With his clothes smoking, John
tears around the corner. The Mogadorians charge after him, but find</p>
<p><strong>six is waiting.</strong>: BOOOOMM! BOOOOMM! She blasts them
at point-blank range. Magenta light gushes from their wounds. Like rain
hitting hot coals, their bodies HISS as they crack and cinder.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: Keep moving! Henri, Mark, Sarah and Sam race
out of view. Then John sees something emerge through the smoky,
water-choked haze.</p>
<p><strong>it’s the second piken!</strong>: It utters a low, predatory
GROWL and launches itself forward. Oddly, Six doesn’t move. She closes
her eyes and lays one hand on the flooded floor, turning the water
to</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Where’s John?</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Right behind us. He offers her his hand.
She’s about to take it when</p>
<p><strong>a mogadorian soldier</strong>: steps out of the shadows.
There is nowhere and no time for Henri and the others to run. But as the
Mogadorian squeezes the trigger of his hand-cannon, the wall on his
right</p>
<p><strong>erupts!</strong>: Bernie and the first Piken crash into the
hall. They are still at each other’s throats and don’t even notice as
they steam-roller over the Mogadorian, squashing him like a bug. The
creatures SMASH through the opposite wall and out of sight. It’s over in
a violent blink.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: They’ve blocked it. Use your telekinesis.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’re not leaving without my friends.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: Don’t you mean the girl? John ignores the jibe
and turns back. Six grabs his arm.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: I broke the Elders’ spell to find you. The Mogs
can kill me now. We have to go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We stay and fight. OFF his determination…</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: You know how to use one of these?</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: My dad’s the sheriff. He slides two across the
floor. The door opens. They swing up to fire but find – John and
Six.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Save it for the Mogs. Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>the shower stalls.</strong>: Water SPURTS from a broken pipe.
The Piken slips on the slick tiles. As it struggles to right itself,
Bernie seizes the moment and sinks his fangs into the monster’s
neck.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The door’s over here. The tunnel leads out to
the stadium. Sarah sweeps back the curtain, revealing a padlocked set of
metal doors. John holds up his hand, snaps the lock and whips the chain
free. The doors fly open,</p>
<p><strong>two mogadorians</strong>: spring out of the dark. One tackles
Henri while the other blindsides John. Henri struggles until</p>
<p><strong>booooom!</strong>: The BLAST cinders the Mog’s head clean
off. Henri looks over and sees Mark holding a smoking shotgun and nods
his thanks. The second has John pinned when it suddenly ROARS in agony
and disintegrates into a shower of sparks, revealing</p>
<p><strong>six.</strong>: She sheathes her dagger and helps John up.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: Saving your life. My new hobby. Sarah notices a
smile of respect flicker between John and Six. PHHHHHHT! PHHHHHHT!
PHHHHHHT! – three Mogadorian knives razor the air. One impales Six in
the shoulder. She slumps at John’s feet. Henri opens FIRE on the</p>
<p><strong>the commander and two mogadorian soldiers</strong>: who storm
towards them. John SCREAMS to Sam and Mark.</p>
<p>****: Get her down the tunnel! They grab Six by the arms and drag her
into the tunnel. Sarah glances back at John and follows after them.
Henri takes out a Soldier. John sweeps up his hand and</p>
<p><strong>the wooden floor opens like a zipper!</strong>: The Commander
and the other Soldier are sent flying as the planks rip free of their
nails. John and Henri charge into the tunnel. The doors fly shut behind
them and the bleacher stand rolls forward to seal the entrance.</p>
<p><strong>a mogadorian</strong>: lurches into the mouth of the tunnel.
Without a second’s hesitation, Sam swings up his gun and BLASTS it. Mark
looks at him in shock as they race through the embers. Sam shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I play a lot of Xbox.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t stop! Get to the woods! She nods and
exits with the others. John and Henri head onto the field after them
when</p>
<p><strong>the second piken</strong>: leaps out of the mouth of the
tunnel behind them. It’s seriously pissed. It bounds straight towards
John. Its fangs glint like barbed wire as it launches itself towards
him. At the last second,</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: nobly shoves John out of the way and is
plucked into the Piken’s jaws. The creature shakes him like a rag doll
and flings him 50 feet down the field. John watches, anguished, as Henri
lands in a heap.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo! The Piken pivots,
turns its crimson eyes on John. It almost seems to smirk. Its fangs are
stained with Henri’s blood. John’s face hardens into a mask of rage.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Henri. Henri GROANS as John cradles his head.
His coat is soaked with blood and his torso is horribly mauled. John
tries to drag him to his feet.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, taillights in five.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: I won’t be coming with you this time. Save
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We go together! Henri smiles, grateful, but at
that moment</p>
<p><strong>the commander’s sword</strong>: flies past John and impales
Henri in the chest. Henri utters a GROAN and his dying eyes meet
John’s.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Find the others. His voice is a GRAVELLED
WHISPER.</p>
<p><strong>henri</strong>: Your life is my life… always. His eyes
flutter closed and he slips from John’s grip. Anguished, John doesn’t
notice his pendant momentarily flicker with a radiant blue light. He
angrily spins to face</p>
<p><strong>the mogadorian commander.</strong>: But in a blur of speed,
the Commander steps forward, wraps his hand around John’s throat and
plucks him into the air. He’s flanked by the remaining Soldiers. John’s
feet kick uselessly as he’s lifted face to face.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian commander</strong>: Number 4. Three Loric pendants
dangle from the Commander’s belt like mocking trophies.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian commander</strong>: Your Cepan saved you on
Lorien. The Commander’s voice hisses with cruel certainty. He wrenches
his sword from Henri’s corpse.</p>
<p><strong>mogadorian commander</strong>: But this moment was
inevitable. The blade shimmers with silver flame as he raises it. John’s
eyes narrow as the sword sweeps towards him. This is the moment his
adolescence officially ends. This is the moment when a warrior is born.
ANGLE ON BLADE as it SHATTERS into a million pieces, which flutter to
the ground like glittering confetti. John stares at the alien with calm
confidence.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing is inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>angle on john’s hand as it ignites.</strong>: The flame is
hotter and brighter than 10,000 acetylene torches. He grips one of the
Commander’s bandoliers. TIGHT ON THE MOGADORIAN’S FACE as he realizes
it’s over. The glass cartridges detonate in a deadly chain reaction.</p>
<p><strong>supernova of fire</strong>: that radiates across the field
like a blinding ring of hell.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Oh my God… John. Before anyone can stop her,
she takes off running, sprinting for the stadium.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John! She charges across the broiled expanse,
hoping against hope. Then she sees John, lying motionless and naked, his
clothes completely burned away. She stops, puts her hand to her mouth to
stifle a sob, when he COUGHS and stirs.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: John! Ash swirls like snow as she races to
his side. They wrap each other in their arms. Neither wanting to ever
let go.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Sorry, Girl Scout first aid didn’t cover
extraterrestrial dagger wounds. Six smiles, grateful.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: The Sheriff’s Department is starting to put up
roadblocks. You guys better get moving. Six and Sarah join them.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You good to go?</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: Don’t worry about me. John nods to Sam.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sam, ride with Six.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: We don’t need baggage. Sam steps in front of
her, determined.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I have to find out if the Mogs took my dad. Six
turns to John, who is not bending, then glares at Sam.</p>
<p><strong>six</strong>: You slow us down, I’ll shoot you myself. Sarah
looks at John, tries to rein in her emotions.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I want to come too.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You need to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You could have died last night. I’m not
putting you in danger again. Mark’s promised to look after you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t want to say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll come back for you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: When it’s safe. She bows her head, anguished.
He gently lifts her chin.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where I’m from, we only give our heart to one
person. I’ve given mine to you.</p>
<p>****: I love you, Sarah. Their lips meet and they kiss. It only ends
when John hears an URGENT RUSTLE in the woods. They turn and watch
as</p>
<p><strong>bernie kosar</strong>: limps into view. Blood mats his fur
and his face is scratched but he’s alive. OFF John’s relief…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is the first town I’ve left without
Henri. The first one I have a reason to come back to. John and Sarah
hold each other’s gaze, desperately trying to brand the image of their
faces onto their memories.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He warned me the pain would be unbearable if I
left her. He was right.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But I don’t regret it. The pain reminds me
what’s at stake. A dust trail plumes as the bikes power into view.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We must find the others and face our enemy
together. I’m not sure how we can stop them. But nothing is inevitable.
I know that now. Thunderheads darken the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I am Number 4. His eyes are fearless and his
face is undaunted by the battles yet to be fought. He’s ready to face a
future unmapped and uncharted. Ready.</p>
