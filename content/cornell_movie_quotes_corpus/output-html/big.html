<p><strong>josh</strong>: You are standing in the cavern of the evil
wizard. All around you are the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs…Melt the
wizard. What do you want to melt him with? What do you think I want to
melt him with… Just a second! Throw the… One minute! Your hesitancy has
cost you dearly. The wizard, sensing your apprehension, unleashes a
fatal blow from the ice scepter. With luck, you will thaw in several
million years. Great.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: C’mon Josh, it’s starting to get awfully
late!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Okay. Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Take the garbage out. Every day, take the
garbage out…Rick Rodin is on the mound for the Yankees! He looks into
the catcher’s mitt, shakes off the first signal, takes the turn, wipes
the sweat off his brow, leans back and fires…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah! Good-bye Mr. Spaulding! …Here, here!
Quick!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Got it. Need it. Need it. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey. Hey. Hey! You ever go by Simpson’s desk
when she’s grading papers or somethin’? When she’s leaned over, you can
see right down her shirt.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Bra?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. No. She’s got one of those undershirt
things. So if you get real close to the board, you can see all the way
down to her flowers.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Woah!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah. Give me your gum.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Need it. Got it. Got it. Need it…</p>

on the top! Ooh, Shelly’s out, walking down the street, ten times a
week! I read it! I said it! I stole my momma’s credit! I’m cool! I’m
hot! Sock me in the stomach three more times!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Don’t forget to call me after supper.</p>

available!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Josh…?</p>

myself.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah. I think it’s something…yeah, I think
it’s something I should do.</p>

filed! Ever since she got engaged, my life has been a disaster!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You know, she came so highly recommended.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: She spent the last three months writing down
her married name. Mrs. Judy Hicks. Mrs. Donald Hicks. Mrs. Judy
Mitchleson Hicks. Sometimes with a hyphen, sometimes without a hyphen.
Sometimes she spells the hyphen!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Well, I really don’t know where I can put
her.</p>

<p><strong>man</strong>: When can you start?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Soon.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I thought we’d start you out with preschoolers.
Should take you a few days. Give you a chance to find your way around.
Do you smoke?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, uh, just once, but…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Only on breaks in the coffee room….Most of that
is pretty straight forward stuff. If you have any questions, come to me.
Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Bye!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Psst! Psst! Hey! Hey! I’m Scott Brennan.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Uh, I’m Josh Baskin.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Listen, what are you trying to do? Get us all
fired?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: You’ve gotta slow down. Pace yourself.
Slowly! Slowly!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Sorry. Today’s my first day.</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: So how long have you worked here?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Five years. Work stinks but the fringe
benefits are great! See that girl over there in the red? Say hi to her
and she’ll be yours. She’ll wrap her legs around you so tight you’ll be
begging for mercy!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, I’ll stay away from her then!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Excuse me. Yeah Brennan. I gave it to you
yesterday! Oh, here it is. I don’t have time to xerox it. Let the new
guy do it.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: That’s total bullshit Paul!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Look sir, the favorability rate is…</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Come on! Let’s not lie to ourselves! If a kid
likes a toy it sells. That’s all!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: But every bit of research and focus
testing…</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: It works with research, it works with focus
testing, it just doesn’t work with the kids!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Sorry! I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why don’t you watch where the hell you’re
going!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Are you okay!</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You could kill somebody running around here
like that!</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: It’s all right Paul. The boss should get
knocked on his ass once in a while. It’s good for him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know sir, maybe you should see a
doctor.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: For crying out loud Paul, I’m fine! I’m
fine!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sorry sir! Sorry!</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Where were you going anyway, son?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Uh, I was going to the xerox room because they
needed these by 5:00.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Oh, that’s good! Nothing wrong with a little
hustle. Nothing at all! Right Paul?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What does he mean? I hustle! Uh sir! Sir!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Hello? …Hello?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Hello. Mrs. Baskin?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I just wanted you to know that Josh is all
right. He’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: You have my boy?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah. And you’re gonna get him back, just the
way he was.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Look, I swear to God–If you do anything to him,
if you touch one hair on his head, I will spend the rest of my life
making sure you suffer!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Wow! Thanks!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Let me talk to Josh!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh, he can’t come to the phone right now.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Why not? Why not? What did you do to him?!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I didn’t do anything to him! I think he’s a
terrific kid!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: I want proof that he’s all right!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Uh, well, all right. Ask me something that
only he would know. Then I’ll ask him for you and that way you’ll know
that he’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ask him what I used to sing to him when he was
a little boy.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Isn’t there something else that you would
rather ask him?</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Ask him!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh, I got it! I got it! Memories, like the
corner of my mind. Misty water color memories, of the way we were.
Scattered pictures…Look, you’re gonna see him again really soon. I
promise. I cross my heart. We’ll talk about this later.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Harris! Brennan! Baskin!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Pay day.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: $187.00?! Ha! Ha!</p>
<p><strong>scott</strong>: Yeah. They really screw you, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Hi. Okay, so how would you like that?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Three dimes, a hundred dollar bill, and eighty
seven ones.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: One, two, three…</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’m never eating again.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It wasn’t that bad.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: It was the boat ride that did it.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No, it was the pork rinds.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Pork rinds! Aghh! We sure had fun, didn’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, we sure did.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Got you!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Jordan, what’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Mine’s Josh.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: I’m gonna blow you away Josh!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: But I just got you!</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: No way! Get back here!</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: You work for me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: I thought so. What, are you here with your
kids?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No. I was just looking around.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Oh. Me too. I come here every Saturday. Can’t
see this on a marketing report.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What’s a marketing report?</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Exactly. Come on. What do you think of
that?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: The Championship Hockey? Oh, I love it. Only
the…</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Only what?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, the pieces don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, on the old set you could slide the men
up and down the ice, and now all they do is spin around. It was more
like real hockey the old way. Why did they change it?</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You see, the Star Fighters are good because
you can change all the pieces. But I never liked the Galactakons. You
only get one robot, and they don’t come with a vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Plus you can’t take them underwater. And if
you do they…Neat!</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Okay, let’s check out the…Piano lessons?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Three years.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Me too. Everyday, after
school….Chopsticks….What department did you say you were in?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh, I’m in computers.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Computers? You just saved me a trip to the
gym Son.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Vice President in charge of Product
Development.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Vice President! He’s only been here a week!
Vice President?!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: And he came from data processing!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s out of his mind! The old man has finally
lost it!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Did you know they gave him Bob’s old
office?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Bob’s office?! Bob’s office is bigger than my
office! There’s got to be a reason. Things like this don’t happen unless
there’s a reason.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That means if the president dies you get to
take over?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No. No. They got a hundred of them. Are we
ready?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes Mr. Baskin.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Come on in.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Look at this place! It’s bigger than the
principal’s office!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: How would you know?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Remember that explosion in science?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh yes!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Truck-a-Killer! $59.95?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You know that only costs 10 bucks to make.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Get out of here! …What is this?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh, well, this is just…They just put this in
here…it doesn’t mean anything.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So what do they make you do for all this?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, I play with all of this stuff and then,
I go in there and tell them what I think.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: And they pay you for that?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Suckers!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh, thank you Miss Patterson. Hey! Miss
Patterson. Could you call down to Media and have them send up a video
tape of the Giants Broncos Super Bowl? And have them edit out all the
commercials and talkin’ and stuff?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Yes Mr. Baskin.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Miss Patterson.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You’re the luckiest guy I know.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did you check Mattel?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Colleco?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Zero.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He can’t come from nowhere Susan. He has to
come from somewhere. How about Hasbro?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yes. And Fisher Price and Worlds of Wonder. I
have called everywhere. Nobody’s ever heard of him!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Great!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Face it Paul. The guy comes from data
processing.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Terrific. That is just terrific! This is just
terrific!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re being paranoid Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: These tests were conducted over a six month
period using a double-blind format of eight over-lapping demographic
groups. Every region of the country was sampled, the focus testing
showed a solid base in the 9 to 11-year old bracket–with a possible
carry-over into the 12-year olds. When you consider that Nobots and
Transformers pull over 37 percent market share, and that we are
targeting the same area, I think that we should see one quarter of that
and that is one fifth of the total revenue from all of last year. Any
questions? Yes? Yes?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What exactly don’t you get?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: It turns from a building into a robot,
right?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Precisely.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, what’s fun about that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, if you had read your industry breakdown,
you would see that our success in the action figure area has climbed
from 27 percent to 45 percent in the last two years. There, that might
help.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I still don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: What don’t you get Josh?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, there’s a million robots that turn into
something. And this is a building that turns into a robot. So what’s so
fun about playing with a building? That’s not any fun!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This is a skyscraper.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, couldn’t it be like a robot that turns
into something like a bug or something?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A bug?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah! Like a big prehistoric insect with maybe
like giant claws that could pick up a car and crush it like that!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: A prehistoric transformer?</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Gentlemen!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: So the robot turns into a bug.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ah, gentlemen, listen…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Listen to him. He’s got a very good idea here.
The robot turns into a bug.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: This is a great idea!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Different sizes and things. And…you could have
them wreck something…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: A lady bug. Transformers for girls!</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: This is a bug that moves….It’s got all kinds
of possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This doesn’t just happen. This doesn’t happen.
You don’t just come to a meeting and say “bugs.”</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I, uh….</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Well done, Josh. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ho! Ho! Ho! He is vicious!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He’s not vicious.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, come on Susan, don’t kid yourself. That
man is a killer!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: All he said was “I don’t get it.”</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t get it! I don’t get! I don’t get! He’s
going for the throat, trying to eviscerate me! Did you see the look on
Macmillan’s face?!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Mmm Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: It’s quite a unique space. The lines are so
clean and you don’t get any of that partition quality. It has 50-foot
ceilings, all hardwood floors, ample closet space, a modern kitchen, a
brand new bathroom with a jet stream jacuzzi.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Baskin. Rental delivery!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Dear Mom and Dad. They said that I could write
you and let you know I was okay. So far, they’re treating me fine. I’ve
got enough to eat and I’m perfectly safe. They say that I’ll get out of
here in about a month. In the mean time, it’s a lot like camp! I watch
TV and even get outside once in a while. I know you miss me. But try not
to worry. I think this experience might even be good for me. I love you
very much and I know that I’ll see you soon. Your son, Joshua. P.S. Give
Rachel a kiss from her big brother.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s very beautiful and I’m having a lovely
time.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: I’m glad Miss Patterson.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: It’s much better than last year. I just
wanted to tell you that.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: I’ll have another scotch….Susan.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Love your tux.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: I think it’s the same as the maitre’s.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Have you decided what you’re doing on the
Danberry line?</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: No, I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well, uh, I think if you got everyone’s input
up front, I mean right from the beginning….</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Susan, have a drink.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Have a couple drinks. It’s a party.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Josh! Glad you could make it.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Bet he gets another raise.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Now that’s what I call a tuxedo.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I rented it. This is a real bow tie though. I
tied it myself. And that’s why I was late.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: No, you’re not late at all. Come on, let me
show you around.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Hey, there’s Miss Patterson! Hi! There’s the
guy from the meeting! Hi!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The guy’s a damn knock-off artist.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The Amphibian? He takes 10,000 G. I. Joes,
slaps some gills on them, webs their feet, and packages them in
seaweed….So I show him the schedule and he says, “It’s not correct
accounting procedure!” Give me a goddamn break!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But the toy sold Paul.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: All the same people having all the same
discussion. It’s like they cloned some party in 1983 and kept spinning
it out again and again and again. I loved your ideas on the Squeezy Doll
line.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: They were so, incisive. It’s Beluga.
Macmillan orders it every year….You all right? You okay? You want a
glass of water? You want something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Could I have a milkshake or something?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’ve got a car outside. You want to get out
of here?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Uh Huh.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m not really a big one for parties. You
know, I like things that are a little more intimate.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Wow! Is this your car?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well, it’s the company’s car.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh, this is the coolest thing I’ve ever
seen!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I mean, just seeing someone in the office,
you don’t really get a chance to know them. I mean, just being with you
here tonight, I really get a sense of who you are.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Are you gonna eat these fries?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No. No….</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Hey mister? You want some of these fries?
We’re not going to eat them.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You see, it’s hard in a business situation…I
mean there’s this invisible line and even you’re attracted to
someone…What, are you going to call someone before…?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Uh, I mean at this point in my life
I…Don’t…Don’t play with the radio…Leave the uh…Don’t…I’m really
vulnerable right now! You know…I mean, I love my job and I….</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Ejector seat! This is great! Hey! Come on up!
Hey, that was my apartment.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Really? I’d love to see where you live.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: So have you always lived alone?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No, not always.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ah. Is it just recently or…?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Give yourself a couple of days, it’ll
pass.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, they said it was gonna take six
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well, it can be painful but, that’s what they
invented Xanax for, right?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Watch your step.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m not sure we should do this yet.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Do what?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well, I mean I like you and I want to spend
the night with you….</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Do you mean sleep over?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well,…yeah!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Okay! But I get to be on top!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You live here?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah. It’s nice, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You uh, want a soda?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Soda? You want one?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: They rigged this up so you don’t need any
quarters….Don’t! Don’t…!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: The glue’s not dry. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: It’s okay….You wanna play pinball?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You don’t need quarters for this either. It’s
free.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Is that a trampoline?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah. You wanna try it?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You should. It’s really fun. It’s simple, too.
Come on! Come on! You’ll like it and it’s really easy to do.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No, I don’t think…</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’m serious…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Do have some wine?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Take off your shoes…It’s really easy….Let me
get rid of these balls.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No, I’m…I’m…I’ll watch.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Come on. It’s fun. I’ll do it with you. Up you
go. Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Help me up?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Okay. Jump.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You want me to jump?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: There. Now can we have a drink?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No! No! No! I mean really jump. Now get some
air between you and the trampoline.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh, come on! I’ll do it with you! All right?
I’ll show you how to do it. You ready? Come on. Jump. See? There it is.
That’s all there is to it. There you go. There you go. Yeah! It’s easy!
Anybody could do this!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Here. Pick one….It’s for you. It’s a glow in
the dark compass ring…so you won’t get lost….Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did you have fun last night?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Sure. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah…You left pretty quick.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I gave him a ride home Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh, did he enjoy it?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ah, that’s me, Mr. Ridiculous. Just a silly
old guy.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I don’t feel like going out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What do you mean? They’re your friends….Come
on! Leave it! Leave it! Would you quit it! Do you have to play with
everything?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Baskin? Baskin!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Wouldn’t you rather play basketball? I know
how to play that. We could be like a team for the Macmillan Company.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’m not very good at sports, but I’ll give it
a try. My best sport is video hockey.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That isn’t a sport.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, it takes eye to hand coordination.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s not a sport if you don’t sweat!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What about golf? You don’t sweat and that’s a
sport.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, and you’re not sittin’ there letting
some machine do all the work!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What about car racing?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Aw shut up Baskin!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What are the rules again?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I told you. Over the line to serve. Yellow is
out of bounds. Play to 21–ready?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Sorry. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: One nothing. Come on! Get it! Get it! Get
it!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thatta boy! Okay, you ready? All right….Ho ho!
Nice try! That was in! Two zip. Just made it. Two zip. Ready? Okay! Here
we go!…19/18.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Uh, that was under the line.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: That was under the line. You said it had to be
over the line on a serve.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah you did! You said it had to be over the
line on a serve!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No I did not, now give me the goddamn
ball!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well that’s cheating!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Give me the goddamn ball, will ya!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Give me the ball you little shit!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: It’s my serve.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Give me the ball! Give me the goddamn ball! I
never said that!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yes you did.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Give me the…Give me the ball! Give me the
ball!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Cheater! You cheat!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I did not cheat!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You cheat! You cheat!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Give me the ball! Give me the ball! Give me
it! Give me the ball!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: He didn’t have to punch me.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I know. He’s scared of you. You don’t play
his game.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I tried to play his game. He beat me up. If
he’s scared of me then why did he punch me?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He punched you because he’s scared of
you.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s just the way he is. Everything is a
fight with him. Everyone’s an enemy. It’s not just a job for him, it’s a
war.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well how come you’re so nice?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, you work just as hard as he does and
you’re not like that.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You don’t…you don’t know me that well.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yes I do. You’re one of the nicest people I’ve
met.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: How do you do it?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What does it look like?! Shampoo, razor,
toothpaste, two neckties and your exercise tape! Oh, and I want my keys
back!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sure. It’s just some scratches. He’ll get over
it.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh, it has nothing to do with him.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Oh come on Susan! He’s just another link in
the chain! First it was Tom Caulfield, then Handlen. Then Golding, then
me! Am I missing somebody?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s not like that anymore!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What is so special about Baskin?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: He’s a grown up!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Susan.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I can’t believe you brought up Golding.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: And many more! What are you going to wish for
this time?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I know what we can do! We can go out and get
some beers, some dirty magazines and go back…</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Uh, I can’t Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What you mean you can’t? Of course you can!
It’s your birthday!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No, I can’t…I have to go somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Um…well, I have to go meet somebody and…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So, you got all night!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah I know, but it’s just…well I can’t right
now okay, but I’ll call you, all right? Okay? I’ll give you a call.
Thanks again Billy, it was fun!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Hi….Do you want to come in?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Sit down….Want to go?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah! Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Want to go again?!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: So they have these cars that you can actually
drive them except they’re on this rail so you can’t get off the road…You
have a really big gob of mustard right, right…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Mustard right….</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Right there.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Is it gone?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well,….</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Is that…gone?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Listen.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What? Music?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Wanna dance?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Dance?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well we don’t have to if you don’t want
to.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Okay….Are you cold?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Mm Mm.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: We could get some hot chocolate….You can wear
my jacket if you want.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh, I haven’t done this in a long time….What
were you like when you were younger?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh, I wasn’t much different.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I believe that about you….I’ve been thinking
about you a lot….It’s crazy….In my car, lying in bed….I’ve just never
gone out with someone like you….With all the other men there was so much
to hide….I feel like I can tell you anything.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Susan? There’s something I think I should tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You want the light on?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Hey Frank, how are you? Good morning
everybody!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Good morning Sir.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’d like some coffee please Miss
Patterson.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: But you don’t drink coffee.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: And uh, make it black.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You know, you two should come to Vermont. It
is so pretty up there.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Did anyone happen to see that great documentary
about Columbus on PBS the other night?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Uh, no. Was it good?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I had no idea he had a fourth ship.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah, the Santa Christina.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: He only had that on his second trip,
though.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You saw it, too.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No, but I used to study…stuff.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Dad, I need some help.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: All right, but not now Adam.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Yeah, but Dad you said…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Adam we have guests.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: He’s had the roughest time with algebra.
We’ve tried tutors, everything.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Algebra? I used to study that, too.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: All right, let’s say Larry Bird is going to
score 10 points in the first quarter.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: How many is he going to score in the whole
game?</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: That’s easy, that’s 40 points.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Probably. Okay. And that’s algebra.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Right! It is?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah! See. Okay. One quarter is to ten points
that he scores in that quarter. Just as four….</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re right. He’s wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Department of Consumer Affairs? Yeah Buddy it
came!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: He’s never done this before.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Kind of like a sweepstakes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Get the Art Department on the phone. Get
them!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Send out for some sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Maybe next year, all right? Next year.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You can do it. I know you can!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I cannot plan a whole line!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Why? Nobody knows more about toys in the
entire company!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Susan, doing that means marketing and strategy
and stuff like that!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: All he wants is a proposal!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I can’t!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Look, you come up with the ideas and I’ll
handle the marketing.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: But it’s….</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Come on. It’ll be neat.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: All right…I don’t know…I don’t have any new
ideas for toys or anything.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’ve got great ideas!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, well tell him I called again. Kopecky!
K-O-P…Yeah right…well tell him it’s important!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You see it won’t be like these where you just
follow the story along. You would actually make a whole different story
appear just by pressing these buttons.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: An electronic comic book? That’s amazing!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah. An electric comic book. It’s gonna be
different every time.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: This is incredible. You’re brilliant–you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: If you like one you could see it, you know,
over and over and over again.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You really like it?…You think Mac will like
it? You know, what we could do…We could do like sports comics…or like if
you’re going to steal second or something like that…You’d have sports
books…baseball, football…really, it work with almost any sport there is.
Hockey!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What…What is it we’re doing? …What’s going on
here?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You know, we’re….Is something wrong? You don’t
like it?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No! No! It’s…I mean if it’s an affair, that’s
one thing. But if it’s something else…I mean, not that we have to know
right now, we don’t…but if we think that it could turn into something
else…well….How do you feel about all of this?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: How do I feel about what?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: How do you feel about me?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: What is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, Wednesday would be better than
Thursday…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Mr. Baskin can’t be disturbed!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yeah, I have the Keating example right
here…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Where’ve you been? I’ve been trying to reach
you forever!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Shh! I’m right in the middle of something
okay?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s the list. All you’ve got to do is
call!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Can you give me just a minute, please?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What are you talking about? This is the
list!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Would you come back at lunch? All right, I’m a
little bit busy right now…Hello?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Busy?!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Billy!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Are you out of your mind?!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Jesus, Billy! Miss Patterson, could you get
them on the phone again….</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: This is the list we’ve been waiting for!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’ve got work to do! Can’t you understand
that? I’ve got a deadline to meet. God!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who the fuck do you think you are?!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey, you’re Josh Baskin! Remember? You broke
your arm on my roof! You hid in my basement when Robert Diceman was
about to rip your head off!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You don’t get it, do you? This is
important!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m your best friend. What’s more important
than that, huh? I’m three months older than you are–asshole!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You are standing in the cavern of the evil
wizard. All around you are the carcasses of slain ice dwarfs….Melt
wizard….What do you want to melt him with? …Throw thermal pod.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Josh, what’s wrong? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I haven’t told you something because if I did,
I didn’t think you’d believe me. And even if you did believe me, I
didn’t think you were going to like me anymore, so….</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh, Honey, come here. You can tell me
anything. What?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Susan, I’m not what you think I am.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Before I met you I was in little league. I was
in little league and I rode my bike to school and I played with my
friends and hung out with them and….</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Josh. Josh. What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I want to go home. I miss my family Susan and
I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh my God! You’re married!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I knew that this was too good to be true! I
knew that there had to be something!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No. No. Susan, I’m not married.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re not?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No. I’m a child!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’m a child Susan, and I’m not ready for all
this.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh that’s fine. That is just great!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, you see what happened….</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No. I understand. I’m not ready to make a
commitment!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No! No! No!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m not ready to accept responsibility!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No! You don’t understand! I mean, I’m thirteen
years old!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh! And who isn’t? You think that there isn’t
a frightened kid inside of me, too!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: No! I mean I really am thirteen! I went to bed
one night and I was a kid, and when I woke up the next morning I was a
grown up.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh right! And just yesterday I was a school
girl with pigtails! Why are you doing this Josh?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: There was this carnival in New Jersey. I made
a wish on this machine. It was called a Zoltar Machine…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh stop it!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: It was called a Zoltar Machine! It had this
bobbing head that looked just like a devil and if you got a quarter in
the devil’s mouth you could make a wish and I did! So I made a wish to
be big! That is what I’m trying to tell you! I changed into a grown up
but I’m really just a kid!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Fine Josh! You’re a kid! Look, I really don’t
know what it is that you’re trying to tell me. But we have a very big
presentation to give tomorrow, so I’m going to get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Josh? Josh! Oh, hi Mrs. Baskin.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Hi. I was just looking around and…Your hair is
getting longer.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I got it cut yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: He had a birthday.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, I know. He’ll be coming back real soon.
Everything is going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Right there. Sea Point Park, New York!
Well?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: They’re waiting for you Mr. Baskin.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: See you around.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: There’s this flat screen inside with pictures
on it and you read it. And when you get down to the bottom you have to
make a choice of what the character’s going to do…Like if he going to go
in and fight the dragon then you have to push one of the buttons.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, it’s a comic book that….</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: See, there’s a computer chip inside which
stores the choices, so when you reach the end of the page, you decide
where the story goes. That’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: Terrific Susan.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: A kid makes his own decision.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: This is really possible?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah. In fact, it’s a very simple program.
Isn’t that right?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: So what happens when you run out of
choices?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well, that’s the great thing. You can just
sell different adventures. Just pop in a new disk and you get a whole
new set of options.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We could market this on a comic book rack.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>mr. m</strong>: How much would the unit cost?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well, our initial figure is around…around
$7.00, with a retail cost of around $18.95.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You expect a kid to pay $19.00 for a comic
book?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I think a kid….Would you excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Josh! Josh!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Will you take me to Sea Point Park, New
York?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sea Point Park? Josh!….Josh! Josh!…Yes!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Excuse me. You know him? You know Josh?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Look, you have to tell me where he went.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m his girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Billy Kopecky.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Look, you have to tell me where he went.
Where did he go? Please, tell me. Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Work! Damn it!….I wish I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Josh!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Susan!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You know, you don’t walk out on somebody! You
don’t just get up and leave and walk out like that! You don’t do
that!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I know. I know. I’m really sorry. I’m really
sorry but I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh God. You got your wish.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I tried to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I didn’t listen, I guess. I didn’t hear
you…</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I tried to tell you last night.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: …or want to…or how would I have…or even if I
did listen, why would I know? Why would I know that?!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’ve been thinking about this and there are a
million reasons for me to go home but there is only one reason for me to
stay.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What? What reason is that?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Well, you…Oh, come on. Don’t cry.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: So, what are you? 15? 16?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’m 13.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well, that explains it.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Maybe you could come with me.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’ve been there before. It’s hard enough the
first time. You know what I mean? You don’t know what I mean….Come on,
I’ll drive you home.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No, I’ll be okay. You’ll be fine. In ten
years, who knows? Maybe you should hold on to my number.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: So this is where you live. Which one is
it?</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: The one right there.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh. It’s nice. I’m gonna miss you.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’m gonna miss you, too.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You won’t even remember me.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh yes I will.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Mom? Hello!</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Josh? Josh! Josh! Oh my God! Oh, thank God
you’re home!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Oh Ma, I missed you all so much!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: I’m just not good enough.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What are you talking about? You’ve been
hitting the ball over the fence almost every time in stick ball. You
just got to get used to a fatter bat.</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: You really think I could do it?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>josh</strong>: Come on. We’ll hit some after supper.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay. I’ll call you. 1</p>
