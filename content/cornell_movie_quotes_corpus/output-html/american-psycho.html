<h1 id="american-psycho">american-psycho</h1>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: With goat cheese profiteroles and I also
have an arugula Caesar salad. For entr�es tonight I have a swordfish
meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge breast in
raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale…</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed
French fries. Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass
broth…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: We’re sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle
Northern California place on the Upper East Side.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You’ll notice that my friends and I all
look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle
differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is
the yes man. Price is the most wired. I’m the best looking. We all have
light tans. Right now I’m in a bad mood because this is not a good
table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to
dress .</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: What are the rules for a sweater
vest?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yes. Clarify.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Or can it be worn with a suit?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: With discreet pinstripes you should wear a
subdued blue or charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a
bolder vest.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You’ll look like you consciously worked for
the look.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped
working out?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It looks that way, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: He took them away because the portions are so
small he probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. This
is a chicks’ restaurant. Why aren’t we at Dorsia?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Are you freebasing or what? That’s not
Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: That’s Paul Owen.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: That’s not Paul Owen. Paul Owen’s on the
other side of the room. Over there.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: cleavage as she bends over to uncork a bottle
of wine � the Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: They don’t have a good bathroom to do
coke in.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yes. McDufus, I am.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Lucky bastard.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh Jesus, McDermott, what does that have to
do with anything?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You spin a dreidel, McDermott, not a
menorah. You spin a dreidel.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No. Just cool it with the anti-Semitic
remarks.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: The voice of reason. The boy next door. And
speaking of reasonable…</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Not bad.</p>
<p><strong>int. limousine - night</strong>: Bateman is pouring vintage
champagne into flutes. Price is lighting up a cigar.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Oh God, I was there. I don’t need to
hear this story again.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Whoa, wait. May I ask where Pamela is
during all this?</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: I don’t want to hear this. He’s going to
say something disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: She let you fuck her without a
condom?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You take Amex, dude?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: There’s this theory out now that if you can
catch the AIDS virus through having sex with someone who is infected,
then you can also catch anything-Alzheimer’s, muscular dystrophy,
hemophilia, leukemia, diabetes, dyslexia, for Christ’s sake-you can get
dyslexia from pussy-</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m not sure, guy, but I don’t think
dyslexia is a virus.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Oh, who knows? They don’t know that. Prove
it.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’m shaking. You open it.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Jeez. That’s not a helluva lot, is it?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Maybe it’s just the light.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Is he fucking selling it by the milligram? Oh
my God…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: It’s a fucking milligram of Sweet’n Low!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s definitely weak but I have a feeling
if we do enough of it we’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I want to get high off this; Bateman, not
sprinkle it on my fucking All-Bran.</p>
<p><strong>guy in stall</strong>: Could you keep it down, I’m trying to
do drugs!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Calm down. Let’s do it anyway</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I guess you’re right…</p>
<p><strong>guy in stall</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No, FUCK YOU!! Sorry, dude. Steroids…Okay,
let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: That’s the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>bargirl</strong>: It’s after eleven. Those aren’t good
anymore. It’s a cash bar. That’ll be twenty-five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: My name is Patrick Bateman. I am twenty-six
years old. I live in the American Garden Buildings on West Eighty-First
Street, on the eleventh floor Tom Cruise lives in the penthouse.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I believe in taking care of myself, in a
balanced diet, in a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my
face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach
crunches. I can do a thousand now.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: After I remove the icepack, I use a deep
pore-cleanser lotion. In the shower, I use a water-activated gel
cleanser, then a honey-almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating
gel scrub.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Then I apply an herb mint facial masque
which I leave on for ten minutes while I prepare the rest of my
routine.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I always use an after-shave lotion with
little or no alcohol because alcohol dries your face out and makes you
look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm, followed by a
final moisturizing “protective” lotion…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman, some
kind of abstraction, hut there is no real me, only an entity, something
illusory, and though I can hide my cold gaze and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping you and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles
are probably comparable: I simply am not there.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It is hard for me to make sense on any
given level. My self is fabricated, an aberration. My personality is
sketchy and unformed, my heartlessness goes deep and is persistent.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: My conscience, my pity, my hopes
disappeared a long time ago, if they ever did exist.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Late?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Aerobics class. Sorry. Any messages?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn’t
say what he was canceling or why.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I occasionally box with Ricky at the
Harvard Club. Anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: And…Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at
Fluties Pier 17.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: After six.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Negative. Cancel it.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Oh? And what should I say?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Just…say…no.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Just say no?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three
at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All
right?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at
Arcadia at eight tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Oh, something. . romantic?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No, silly. Forget it. I’ll make them.
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No. No. Be a doll and just get me a
Perrier, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: You look nice today.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don’t wear
that outfit again.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Ummm…what? I didn’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I said “Do not wear that outfit again.”
Wear a dress. A skirt or something.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: You don’t like this, I take it?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Come on, you’re prettier than that.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Thanks, Patrick.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m not here. And high heels. I like high
heels.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’d want a zydeco band, Patrick. That’s what
I’d want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something ethnic to
shock Daddy Oh, I can’t decide…And lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva.
And oysters on the halfshell.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m trying to listen to the new George
Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fianc�e-keeps buzzing in my ear.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of
roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We’ll get Annie Leibovitz. And
we’ll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Do…what.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Get married. Have a wedding.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Evelyn?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes, darling?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Is your Evian spiked?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: We should do it.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No-I can’t take the time off work.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Your father practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like, silly.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don’t
you just quit? You don’t have to work.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Because I…want…to…fit…in.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m on the verge of tears by the time we
arrive at Espace since I’m positive we won’t have a decent table, but we
do, and relief washes over me in an awesome wave.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: The menu’s in braille.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her
boyfriend Stash. He’s an artist.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hi. Pat Bateman.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Let me guess-you live in the East
Village?</p>
<p><strong>stash</strong>: SoHo.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I am fairly sure that Timothy and Evelyn
are having an affair. Timothy is the only interesting person I know.
Courtney is almost perfect looking. She s usually operating on one or
more psychiatric drugs. Tonight I believe it’s Xanax. More disturbing
than her drug use, though, is the fact that she’s engaged to Luis
Carruthers, the biggest dufus in the business.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Tell me. Stash…do you think SoHo is
becoming to…commercial?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Yes, I read that.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Oh, who gives a rat’s ass?</p>
<p><strong>vanden</strong>: Hey. That affects us.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Oh ho ho. That affects us? What about the
massacres in Sri Lanka, honey? Doesn’t that affect us, too? I mean don’t
you know anything about Sri Lanka? About how the Sikhs are killing like
tons of Israelis there? Doesn’t that affect us?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh come on. Price. There are a lot more
important problems than Sri Lanka to worry about. Sure our foreign
policy is important, but there are more pressing problems at hand.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And
slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we
can’t ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from
abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the
homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while
also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to
protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women’s freedom of
choice.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: We also have to control the influx of
illegal immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral
values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in movies, in pop music,
everywhere. Most importantly we have to promote general social concern
and less materialism in young people.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Patrick, how thought-provoking.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Why don t you just go for Price?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: He’s rich.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Everybody’s rich.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: He’s good-looking.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Everybody’s good-looking, Patrick.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: He has a great body</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Everybody has a great body now.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What do you want to do with that, floss with
it?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Are you using minoxidil?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No. I’m not. Why should I ?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Your hairline looks like it’s receding.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen, wait. You’re not…shhh wait… you’re
not giving me valid reasons.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What are you trying to say to me?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee?
Bleach-ee. Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Two things. One. You can’t bleach a
Soprani. Out of the question. Two. Two. I can only get these sheets in
Santa Fe. These are very expensive sheets and I really need them
clean.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: If you don’t shut your fucking mouth I will
kill you, are you understanding me?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Now listen-I have a very important lunch
meeting at Hubert’s in thirty minutes, and I need those …no wait, twenty
minutes. I have a lunch meeting at Hubert’s in twenty minutes with
Ronald Harrison and I need those sheets cleaned by this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: This is crazy. You’re a fool. I can’t cope
with this.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Stupid bitchee! Understand? Oh Christ!</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hello</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Isn’t it ridiculous? Coming all the way up
here, but you know. They really are the best.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Then why can’t they get these stains out? I
mean can you talk to these people or something? I’m not getting
anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Oh my, I see. What are those? Oh my.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Um, well…it s cranberry juice.
Cranapple.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, I mean, um, it s really…Bosco. You
know, like… like a Dove Bar. It’s a Dove Bar…Hershey’s Syrup?</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Oh yeah. Oh I get it. Fun with
chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen, if you could talk to them I would
really appreciate it. I’m really late. I have a lunch appointment at
Hubert’s in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Hubert’s? Oh really? It moved uptown,
right?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yeah, well, oh boy, listen, I’ve got to go.
Thank you, uh… Victoria?</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Maybe we could have lunch one day next
week? You know, I’m downtown near Wall Street quite often.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh, I don’t know, Victoria. I’m at work all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Well, what about, oh, you know, maybe a
Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Next Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh, can’t, I’m afraid. Matin�e of Les
Miserables. Listen, I’ve really got to go. I’ll-Oh…Christ…I’ll call
you.</p>
<p><strong>victoria</strong>: Okay. Do.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen, what are you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: What? Oh, I’m…busy.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen, you’re dating Luis, he’s in
Arizona. You’re fucking me, and we haven’t made plans. What could you
possibly be up to tonight?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Stop it. I’m…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: On a lot of lithium?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he’d
call tonight. Oh don’t be difficult, Patrick.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You should come have dinner with me.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: But-when?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Am I confused or were we talking about
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight.
I need to be home for that.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Pumpkin?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Pumpkin you’re dating an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Pumpkin you’re dating the biggest dickweed
in New York.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: I know. Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Pumpkin, you’re dating a tumbling, tumbling
dickweed.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Patrick don’t call me pumpkin anymore,
okay? I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Courtney? Dinner?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m thinking Dorsia.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Dorsia’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Nice?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: You like it there, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: The question is do you like it, Courtney?
And will you blow off a fucking phone call from your sad excuse for a
boyfriend to eat there tonight.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Okay. Yeah. What time?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Eight?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Pick me up?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Sounds like I’ll have to. Don’t fall
asleep, okay? Wear something fabulous. Dorsia, remember?</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Dorsia. Please hold.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Dorsia.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Umm…yes…I know it’s a little late but is it
possible to reserve a table for two at eight or eight-thirty
perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was
really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver
muffin dish.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Is that Donald Trump’s car?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You know, Courtney, you should take some
more lithium. Or have a Diet Coke. Some caffeine might get you out of
this slump.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: I just want to have a child. Just…two…
perfect…children…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: J&amp;B. Straight.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have
that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman
leans over and pulls her back up.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Are we here?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: This is Dorsia?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes, dear.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Courtney, you’re going to have the peanut
butter soup with smoked duck and mashed squash. New York magazine called
it a ’playful but mysterious little dish.” You’ll love it. And then…the
red snapper with violets and pine nuts. I think that’ll follow
nicely.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Mmmm…thanks, Patrick.</p>
<p><strong>int. courtney’s bedroom - night</strong>: Bateman and
Courtney are in Courtney’s bed. Bateman is on top of her, reaching for a
condom in the ashtray. He tears it open with his teeth, puts it on.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: I want you to fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Luis is a despicable twit.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes, Luis is a despicable twit. I hate
him.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: No, you idiot. I said “Is it a receptacle
tip?” Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off
me.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Is it a what?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Pull out.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m ignoring you.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Pull out, goddamnit!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What do you want, Courtney?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s a plain end. I think.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Turn the light on.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh Jesus. I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on
the light.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s a plain end, see? So?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Take it off.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Because you have to leave half an inch at
the tip � to catch the force of the ejaculate!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m getting out of here. Where’s your
lithium?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Do you think you’re turning me on by
having unsafe sex?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh Christ, this really isn’t worth it. And
see, Courtney, it’s there for what? Huh? Tell us. Why is it pulled down
half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate!</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Well, it’s not a turn-on for me. I have a
promotion coming to me. I don’t want to get AIDS.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy,
you dumb bitch?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Oh God, just get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Patrick, thanks so much for looking
after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a
reservation there?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Lucky, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: That’s a wonderful jacket. Let me guess,
Valentino Couture?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: It looks so soft.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Your compliment was sufficient Luis.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are
you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’ve been great. And you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead
Marcus Halberstam. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&amp;P
and in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant
for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to
the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: How’s the Ransom account going, Marcus?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s…it’s…all right.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Really? That’s interesting. Not great?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh well, you know.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: And how’s Cecilia? She’s a great girl.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh yes. I’m very lucky.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Thank you, Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Listen, Paul. Squash?</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Call me.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: How about Friday?</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at
Dorsia. Great sea urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks
away and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying
papers.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How’d he
swing that?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: What’s that, a gram?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: New card. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Picked them up from the printers
yesterday</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Good coloring.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: That’s bone. And the lettering is something
called Silian Rail.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: It is very cool, Bateman. But that’s
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: That’s really nice.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Eggshell with Romalian type. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Jesus. This is really super. How’d a nitwit
like you get so tasteful?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I can’t believe that Price prefers
McDermott’s card to mine.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: But wait. You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Raised lettering, pale nimbus white…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Impressive. Very nice. Let’s see Paul
Owen’s card.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Look at that subtle off-white coloring. The
tasteful thickness of it. Oh my God, it even has a watermark…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hello. Pat Bateman.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You want some money?. Some…food?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Is this what you need?</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: I’m so hungry.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s cold out, too, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: I’m so hungry.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Why don’t you get a job? If you’re so
hungry, why don’t you get a job?</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: I lost my job…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you
lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on
the job?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Gee, uh, that’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: I’m so hungry.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Why don’t you get another one? Why don’t ,
you get another job?</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: I’m not…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You’re not what? Qualified for anything
else?</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: I’m hungry</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I know that, I know that. Jeez, you’re like
a broken record. I’m trying to help you.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen, do you think it’s fair to take
money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work?</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: What am I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen, what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: Al.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Speak up. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: Al.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Get a goddamn job, Al. You’ve got a
negative attitude. That’s what’s stopping you. You’ve got to get your
act together. I’ll help you.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: You re so kind, mister. You’re kind.
You’re a kind man. I can tell.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Shhhh…it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: Please…I don know what to do. I’m so
cold.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench,
my God.</p>
<p><strong>homeless man</strong>: I can’t…I can’t find a shelter</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You reek. You reek of…shit. Do you know
that? Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot.
Al…I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s just that…I don’t know I don’t have
anything in common with you.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Do you know what a fucking loser ,you
are?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: There’s a quarter. Go buy some gum.</p>
<p><strong>facialist</strong>: What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman.
So fine, so smooth…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I have all the characteristics of a human
being- flesh, blood, skin, hair-but not a single clear, identifiable
emotion except for greed ,und disgust. Something horrible is happening
inside me and I don’t know why.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: My nightly bloodlust has overflowed into my
days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I think my mask of sanity is about to
slip.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Marcus Halberstam. For two at eight?</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Your friend has already been seated.
Follow me, Mr. Halberstam.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: No, I want to know. I came here for the
cilantro crawfish gumbo, which is after all the only excuse one could
have for being in this restaurant, which is by the way, almost
completely empty. Am I to believe that all ten people in this restaurant
have eaten your entire supply of cilantro crawfish gumbo?</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: I’m very sorry sir. There was a fire in the
kitchen earlier today, and-</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: J&amp;B, straight. And a Dixie beer.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Would you like to hear-</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Double Absolut martini.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Yes, sir. Would you like to hear the
specials?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Not if you want to keep your spleen.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: This is a real beehive of, uh, activity,
Halberstam.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen, the mud soup and the charcoal
arugula are outrageous here.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Yeah, well, you’re late.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hey, I’m a child of divorce. Give me a
break Hmmm, I see they’ve omitted the pork loin with lime jello.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: We should’ve gone to Dorsia. I could’ve gotten
us a table.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Nobody goes there anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Is that Ivana Trump over there? Jeez
Patrick I mean Marcus, what are you thinking? Why would Ivana be at
Texarkana?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: So, wasn’t Rothschild originally handling
the Fisher account? How did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then
I’d have to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>later:</strong>: Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold
sober.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I like to dissect girls. Did you know I’m
utterly insane?</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do
you tan?</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: I’ve got a tanning bed at home. You should
look into it.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she
tonight?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Cecelia is, well…you know she’s having
dinner with…Evelyn Williams.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser
Patrick Bateman. What a dork.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Another Martini, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy.
Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable.
Let’s leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap?</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: No, man. I’m gonna bail.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. I’ve got
a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for
us.</p>
<p><strong>int. bateman’s apartment - night</strong>: The living room
floor has been meticulously covered with newspaper.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You like Huey Lewis and the News?</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: They’re okay.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Their early work was a little too New Wave
for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came
into their own, commercially and artistically.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: The whole album has a clear, crisp sound
and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big
boost. Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. He
walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen from behind ail
the time.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: He’s been compared to ELvis Costello but I
think Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Hey, Halberstam?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes, Owen?</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Why are there copies of the Style section all
over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No, Owen.</p>
<p><strong>owen</strong>: Is that a raincoat?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their
most accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is “HiP
To Be Square,” a song so catchy that most people probably don’t listen
to the lyrics. But they should because it’s not just about the pleasures
of conformity and the importance of trends. It’s al~ a personal
statement about the band itself.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hey, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now,
you fucking stupid bastard!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Fucking bastard…</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Patrick? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No, Luis. It’s not me. You’re mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: This is Gwendolyn Ichiban. This is my
very good friend Patrick Bateman. Where are you going? We’re going to
Nell’s. Gwendolyn’s father’s buying it. Where did you get your overnight
bag?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Commes des Garcon.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Call me please, Patrick.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Jesus lives, Luis.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Where to send the bastard? Dallas?
Pans?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Singapore? London. I’ll send the asshole to
London.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hi, this is Paul. I’ve been called away to
London for a few days. Meredith, I’ll call you when I get back. Hasta la
vista, baby.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Ye-es, Je-an?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Detective Donald KIMBALL?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Tell him I’m at lunch.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Patrick, I think he knows you’re here. It’s
only ten-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he
picks up the cordless phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other
end.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Now, John, you’ve got to wear clothes in
proportion to your physique. There are definite do’s and don’ts, good
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt calls for
solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Right. And yes…always tip the stylist
fifteen percent.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen, John, I’ve got to go. T Boone
Pickens just walked in… Just joking… No don’t tip the owner of the
salon. Okay, John, right, got it. Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: No, I’m sorry. I should’ve made an
appointment. Was that anything important?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh that? Just mulling over business
problems. Examining opportunities…Exchanging rumors… Spreading
gossip.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Hi. I’m Donald KIMBALL</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I’m sorry to barge in on you like this. but
I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn’t in and…well,
you’re here, so…I know how busy you guys can get.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: So, what’s the topic of discussion?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I’ve been hired by Meredith Powell to
investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You’re not with the FBI or anything, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Nothing like that. I’m just a private
investigator.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Ah, I see…Yes. Paul’s
disappearance…Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: So it’s nothing that official. I just have
some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself-</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: No. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Perrier? San Pellegrino?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: No, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Can you bring Mr…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Mr. Kimball a bottle of San Pelle-</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Oh no, I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s no problem</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, what’s the topic of discussion?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: The disappearance of Paul Owen.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh right. Well, I haven’t heard anything
about the disappearance or anything… Not on “Page Six” at least.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I think his family wants this kept
quiet.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Understandable. Lime?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: No, really. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You sure? I can always get you a lime.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Just some preliminary questions that I need
for my own files, okay?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Twenty-six. I’ll be twenty-seven in
October.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Where did you go to school?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Harvard. The Harvard Business School.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Your address?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Fifty-five West Eighty-First Street. The
American Gardens Building.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Nice. Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Pardon me, but are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Who do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: You seem…nervous.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Nuprin?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Bad habit.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I know. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Would you rather I not smoke?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No, I guess it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Yes, Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Bring us an ashtray for Mr. KIMBALL,
please. She whisks in with a crystal ashtray as they sit in silence.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: What can you tell me about Paul Owen?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: How well did you know him?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m…at a loss. He was part of that
whole…Yale thing, you know.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Yale thing?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yeah…Yale thing.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: What do you mean…Yale thing?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, I think for one that he was probably
a closet homosexual. Who did a lot of cocaine…that Yale thing.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: So…there’s nothing you can tell me about
Paul Owen?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: He led what I suppose was an orderly life.
He… ate a balanced diet.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: What kind of man was he? Besides… the
information you’ve just given.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I hope I’m not being cross-examined
here.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Do you feel that way?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No. Not really.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Where did Paul hang out?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hang…out?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Yeah. You know…hang out.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Let me think. The Newport. Harry’s.
Fluties. Endochine. Nell’s. Comell Club. The New York Yacht Club. The
regular places.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: He had a yacht?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No, he just hung out there.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: And where did he go to school?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Don’t you know this?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I just wanted to know if you know.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Before Yale? If I remember correctly, Saint
Paul’s… Listen, I just…I just want to help.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Anything else you can tell me about
Owen?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: We were both seven in 1969.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: So was I.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Do you have any witnesses or
fingerprints?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Well, there’s a message on his answering
machine saying he went to London.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, maybe he did, huh?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: His girlfriend doesn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: But…has anyone seen him in London?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Actually, yes.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Well, I’ve had a hard time getting an
actual verification. A Stephen Hughes says he saw him at a restaurant
there, but I checked it out and what happened is, he mistook a Hubert
Ainsworth for Paul, so…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Was he involved at all , do you think, in
occultism or Satan worship?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I know it sounds like a lame question, but
in New Jersey I know this sounds like a lame question, but last month-I
don’t know if you’ve heard about this, but a young stockbroker was
recently arrested and charged with murdering a young Chicano girl and
performing voodoo rituals with various body parts-</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yikes! No. Paul wasn’t into that. He
followed a balanced diet and-</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Yeah, I know, and was into that whole Yale
thing.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Have you consulted a psychic?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Had his apartment been burglarized?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: No, it actually hadn’t. Toiletries were
missing. A suit was gone. So was some luggage. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I mean no one’s dealing with the homicide
squad yet or anything, right?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: No, not yet. As I said, we’re not sure.
But… basically no one has seen or heard anything.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: That’s so typical, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: It’s just strange. One day someone’s
walking around, going to work, alive, and then…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: People just…disappear.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: The earth just opens up and swallows
people.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Eerie. Really eerie.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You’ll have to excuse me. I have a lunch
meeting with Cliff Huxtable at Four Seasons in twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Isn’t the Four Seasons a little far uptown?
I mean aren’t you going to be late?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Uh, no. There’s one…down here.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Oh really? I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes. It’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Listen, if anything occurs to you, any
information at all…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Absolutely, I’m 100% with you.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Great, and thanks for your, uh, time,
Mr. Bateman.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You like that, slut?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You want to know what I’m wearing?
Sixty-dollar boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar
white cotton T-shirt by Commes des Garcons. My Rolex cost-</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m a corporate raider. I orchestrate
hostile takeovers. What do you think of that? Huh, bitch?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Dad, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I haven’t seen you around here.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: You just haven’t been looking.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Would you like to see my apartment?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I’m not supposed to.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Do you want to come to my apartment or
not?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I’m not supposed to. But I can make an
exception.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Do you take American Express?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Do you take American Express?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m joking. Come on, get in.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’d like a girl, early twenties, blonde,
who does couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the American
Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really can’t stress blonde enough.
Blonde.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: That’s a very fine Chardonnay you’re
drinking.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I want you to clean your vagina.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No. From behind. Get on your knees.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I want to watch. You have a very nice
body.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Thank you. Send her up. Christie, get out
and dry off, choose a robe-not the Bijan and come and meet me and our
guest in the living room for drinks.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You’ve arrived! How lovely, let me take
your coat. I’m Paul. How good of you to come.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Not quite blonde, are you? More dirty
blonde. I’m going to call you Sabrina. I’m Paul Owen.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: So, don’t you want to know what I do?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sabrina</strong>: No, not really.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, I work on Wall Street. At Pierce
&amp; Pierce. Have you heard of it?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: You have a really nice place here…Paul.
How much did you pay for it?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Actually, that’s none of your business,
Christie, hut I can assure you it certainly wasn’t cheap.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No, no smoking. Not in here.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Varda truffle?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I don’t want you to get drunk, but that’s a
very fine Chardonnay you’re not drinking.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Do you like Phil Collins? I’ve been a big
Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980 album, Duke. Before
that I really didn’t understand any of their work. It was too artsy, too
intellectual. It was on Duke where Phil Collins’ presence became more
apparent. He puts aside the CD and takes out another one.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I think “Invisible Touch” is the group’s
undisputed masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s an epic meditation on intangibility,
at the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding
three albums. Christie, take off the robe.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of
Banks, Collins and Rutherford. You can practically hear every nuance of
every instrument. Sabrina, remove your dress.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: In terms of lyrical craftsmanship and sheer
songwriting, this album hits a new peak of professionalism. Sabrina, why
don’t you dance a little?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Take the lyrics to “Land of Confusion.” In
this song, Phil Collins addresses the problem of abusive political
authority.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: “In Too Deep” is the most moving pop song
of the 1980s about monogamy and commitment. The song is extremely
uplifting. Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as anything I’ve
heard in rock.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Christie, get down on your knees, so
Sabrina can see your asshole.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more
commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially
songs like “In the Air Tonight” and “Against All Odds.” Sabrina, don’t
just stare at it. Eat it.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: But I also think that Phill Collins works
better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and I
stress the word artist. This is “Sussudio,” a great, great song, a
personal favorite.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Don’t touch the Rolex.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: We’re not through yet…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody.
What do you think, Bateman?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I know her. I knew her.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Because he dated her.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: How did you guess?</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Girls dig Bateman. He’s CQ. You’re total
CQ, Bateman.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Thanks, guy, but…she’s got a lousy
personality.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: If they have a good personality, then
something is very wrong.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, let’s just say hypothetically, okay?
What if they have a good personality? I know, I know-</p>
<p><strong>all in unison</strong>: There are no girls with good
personalities!</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: A good personality consists of a chick
with a little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without being
too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking
mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Do you know what Ed Gein said about
women?</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Ed Gein? Maitre d’ at Canal Bar?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No, serial killer, Wisconsin in the
fifties. He was an interesting guy.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: He said, “When I see a pretty girl walking
down the street I think two things. One part of me wants to take her out
and talk to her and be real nice and sweet and treat her right.”</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What her head would look like on a
stick.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Hi, guys. I wanna get your opinion on
something.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Yes, I do. No, it’s my business card-I
decided to get a new one too.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Listen, what about dinner?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Is that all you ever have to contribute,
Van Patten? “What about fucking dinner?”</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Keep touching me like that and you’ll draw
back a stump.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Is this tap water? I don’t drink tap
water Bring me an Evian or something, okay?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: God, Patrick. Why here?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: I’ve seen you looking at me. I’ve
noticed your hot body.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Don’t be shy.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: You don’t know how long I’ve wanted it.
Ever since that Christmas party at Arizona 206. You know the one, you
were wearing that red-striped paisley Armani tie.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: I want you. I want you…too.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What…is…it?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’ve gotta…I’ve gotta…return some
videotapes.</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carruthers</strong>: I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Will you call me before Thanksgiving?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: What are you doing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar
afterwards, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You and…Luis?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and
Maura’s, but-you know how Luis is…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I never knew you smoked.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: You never noticed.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Listen…Patrick. Can we talk?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You look marvelous. There’s nothing to say.
You’re going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Isn’t that special? Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes, Courtney?</p>
<p><strong>c0urtney</strong>: If I don’t see you before Thanksgiving,
have a nice one, okay?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You too.</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>courtney</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Mr. Bateman?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Detective Kendall…uh Campbell?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Kimball. Call me Don.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Don.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: So…you hang out here a lot?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Uh, yes…I mean…whenever necessary. You
know.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: How’s the investigation going? Taken anyone
in for “formal questioning?”</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly.
What’s that, Stoli?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking
dump.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Too true. You know, Bateman-people tend to
reveal so much more about themselves when they’re in a relaxed setting,
don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Some people just can t help themselves.
Another Stoli?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I mean they want to get caught.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Dan, great to see you again. Like I said,
you need anything at all, I’m your man. I don’t envy your job. I mean
Owen was a…complex man.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Rasta Man!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I mean-Mon. We be jammin’…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I have to talk to these girls? They’re
models.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Let’s have a conversation. So…it was hot out
today, no?</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Where did Craig go?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Well, Gorbachev is downstairs. McDermott is
going to sign a peace treaty with him between the United States and
Russia. McDermott’s the one behind glasnost, you know.</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: Well…yeah. But he told me he was in mergers
and acquisitions.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: You’re not confused, are you?</p>
<p><strong>libby</strong>: No, not really.</p>
<p><strong>caron</strong>: Gorbachev’s not downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Are you Iying?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Yes, Caron’s right. Gorbachev’s not
downstairs. He’s at Tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Ask me a question.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: So, what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What do you think I do?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: A model? An actor?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No. Flattering, but no.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I m into, well, murders and executions
mostly.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Welt…it depends, why?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: Well, most guys I know who work in mergers
and acquisitions don’t really like it.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: So, where do you work out?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’m leaving. I’m getting out.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Leaving what?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: This.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Don’t, I’ll drink it.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Listen to me, Patrick. I’m leaving.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Where to? Are you going to go get a
gram?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I’m leaving! I…am…leaving!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Don’t tell me…merchant banking?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: No, you dumb son of a bitch. I’m serious. I’m
disappearing.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Goodbye! Fuckheads!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Price! Come back!</p>
<p><strong>ext. club - night</strong>: Bateman and Daisy are waiting for
a cab.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there,
he plays in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn’t understand
what I was doing with a yuppie.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh really?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: He said… He said you gave him bad vibes.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: That’s…that’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: You think I’m dumb, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: You think I’m dumb. You think all models are
dumb.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No. I really don’t.</p>
<p><strong>daisy</strong>: That’s okay. I don’t mind. There’s something
sweet about you.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Doin’ the crossword?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Need help?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Jean?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Yes, Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Would you like to accompany me to
dinner?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: That is…if you’re not doing anything.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Oh no. I have no plans.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, isn’t this a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen, where should we go?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Anywhere you want?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Let’s not think about what I want. How
about anywhere you want.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Oh Patrick, I can’t make this decision.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No, come on. Anywhere you want.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Oh, I can’t. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Come on. Where do you want to go? Anywhere
you want. Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: What about…Dorsia?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Soooo…Dorsia is where Jean wants to go…</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. No, we’ll go anywhere you
want.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Dorsia is…fine.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Dorsia, yes?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes, can you take two tonight, oh, let’s
say at nine o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: We are totally booked.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh really? That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: I said we are totally booked.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Two at nine? Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: There are no tables available tonight.
The waiting list is also totally booked.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: See you then.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes? You’re dressed…okay.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: You didn’t give them a name.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: They know me.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Why don’t you meet me at my house at seven
o’clock for drinks, okay?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: And Jean? You’ll want to change before we
go out.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Patrick, it’s so…elegant. What a wonderful
view.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Jean? Sorbet?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Thanks, Patrick. I’d love some.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Want a bite?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m on a diet. But thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: You don’t need to lose any weight. You’re
kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You can always he thinner. Look…better.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Well, maybe we shouldn’t go out to dinner. I
don’t want to ruin your willpower.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No. It’s all right. I’m not very good at
controlling it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: So listen, what do you really want to do
with your life?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: And don’t tell me you enjoy working with
children, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Well, I’d like to travel. And maybe go back to
school, but I really don’t know…I’m at a point in my life where there
seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I’m so… I don’t know…unsure.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Do you have a boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: No, not really.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Maybe. I don’t know Not really. Bateman
opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a
cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a
rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Jean, do you feel…fulfilled? I mean, in
your life?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too
focused on my work, I think, but now I’ve really begun to think about
changing myself, you know, developing, and…growing.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Growing. I’m glad you said that.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Did you know that Ted Bundy’s first dog, a
collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Who’s Ted Bundy?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh. Uh, tape. Duct tape. I…need it for…
taping something. Bateman goes back to the cupboard for the nail
gun.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone
happy?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What…No! Put it in the carton.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Jean? What?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Make someone happy-have you ever wanted
to?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m looking for…I guess you could say I
just want to have a meaningful relationship with someone special.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Hmmmm.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Patrick I know you’re there. Pick up the
phone, you bad boy. What are you up to tonight? It’s me. Don’t try to
hide. I hope you’re not out with some little number you picked up
because you’re my Mr. Bateman. My boy next door. Anyway you never called
me and you said you would and I’ll leave a message for Jean about this
too to remind you but we’re having dinner with Melania and Taylor-you
know Melania, she went to Sweet Briar, auld Taylor, he went to
Cornell-and we’re meeting at the Cornell Club, so l’ll call you tomorrow
morning probably-bye, honey-oopps! You hate that. Bye Mr. Big Time CEO
Patrick. Bye. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Was that…Evelyn?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Are you still seeing her?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I’m sorry, I have no right to ask that.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Do you want me to go?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes. I don t think I can…control
myself.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: I know I should go. I know I have a tendency
to get involved with unavailable men, and…I mean, do you want me to
go?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: If you stay, I think something bad will
happen. I think I might hurt you. You don’t want to get hurt, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: No. No, I guess not. I don’t want to get
bruised. You’re right, I should go.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: And don’t forget you have a breakfast meeting
with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at ’21.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Thanks. It slipped my mind completely.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Kimball-I’ve been wanting to talk with you,
Come into my office. Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I actually came to see Timothy Price, but
he’s taken a leave of absence.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yeah, gone into rehab. Shame. Is he a
suspect?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Do you remember where you were on the night
of Paul’s disappearance? Which was on the twentieth of December?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: God…I guess…I was probably returning
videotapes.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I had a date with a girl named
Veronica.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Wait. That’s not what I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: That’s not the information I’ve
received.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well…I…Wait…What information have you
received?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Let’s see… That you were with-</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, I could he wrong.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Well…When was the last time you were with
Paul Owen?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: We had…gone to a new musical called…Oh
Africa, Brave Africa. It was…a laugh riot…and that’s about it. I think
we had dinner at Orso’s. No, Petaluma. No, Orso’s. The…last time I
physically saw him was…at an automated teller. I can’t remember
which…just one that was near, um, Nell’s.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Patrick, please. I hope I’ve been
informative. Long day-a bit scattered.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Listen, I’m a little spent for now but how
about lunch in a week or so when I’ve sorted out all this
information?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Great, yes, I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: And if you could try and pin down where you
were the night of Owen’s disappearance, it would make my job a lot
easier.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Absolutely. I’m with you on that one.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard
it? I just bought it on my way here.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Never. I mean…I don’t really like…
singers.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Not a big music fan, eh?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No, I like music. Just-they’re-Huey’s too…
black sounding. For me.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday?
I’ll call your secretary about reservations.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I’m not so sure about this. I had to go to
Emergency after last time…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh this won’t be anything like last time, I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Just come in the limo and talk to me for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Nothing like last time, promise.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Alright.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: So, you’re looking great, how have you
been?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Well, I actually might need a little
surgery after last time.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: My friend told me I should maybe even get
a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh, lawyers are so complicated-don’t do
that. Here.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Uh uh uh. Half now, half later.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Okay, your name is Christie. We’re meeting
a friend of mine, Elizabeth. She’ll be joining us in my new apartment
shortly. You’ll like her. She’s a very nice girl. Don’t say anything
about yourself. Is that clear. Christie?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You look really familiar. Did you you go
to Dalton?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I think I met you at Au Bar, didn’t I ?
With Spicey?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Well, maybe not with Spicey but it was
definitely at Au Bar.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You know, Au Bar?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Anyway, Au Bar sucks now, it’s terrible.
I went to a birth day party there for Malcolm Forbes. Oh my God,
please.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: This is nicer than your other
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s not that nice.</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: Where did you two meet?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh God! I met him at, oh God, the
Kentucky Derby in ’86-no, ’87, and… You were hanging out with that bimbo
Allison Poole. Hot number.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What do you mean, she was a hot number.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: If you had an American Express card she’d
give you a blowjob. Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I
say more?…What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: She’s my…cousin.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Uh huh?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: She’s from…France.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Where’s your phone? I’ve got to call
Harley.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Where do you summer? Southampton?</p>
<p><strong>christie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh God, it’s his machine.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Elizabeth, it’s three in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He’s a goddamn drug dealer! These are his
peak hours.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Don’t tell him you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Why would I?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: This tastes weird. Harley? It’s me. I
need your services. Translate that anyway you’d like. I’m at-</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: You’re at Paul Owen s.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Paul Owen.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I’m at
Paul Norman’s and I’ll try you later and if I don’t see you at Canal Bar
tomorrow night I’m going to sic my hairdresser on you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Did you know that guy who disappeared?
Didn’t he work at Pierce &amp; Pierce, too? Was he a friend of
yours?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I’d
take a Halcyon.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Listen, I would just like to see…the two of
you…get it on. What’s wrong with that? It’s totally disease-free.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Patrick, you re a lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Come on. Don’t you find Christie
attractive?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Let’s not get lewd. I’m in no mood to
have a lewd conversation.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Come on. I think it would be a turn-on.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Does he do this all the time?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Christie, you’re not drinking your
wine.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Are you telling me you’ve never gotten it
on with a girl?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No! I’m not a lesbian. Why do you think
I’d be into that?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one
thing.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.
You’re making me feel weird.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Did you know that Whitney Houston’s debut
LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did
you know that, Christie? Whitney’s voice leaps across so many boundaries
and is so versatile-though she’s mainly a jazz singer-that it’s hard to
take in the album on a first listening.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You actually listen to Whitney Houston?
You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s hard to choose a favorite track among
so many great ones, but “The Greatest Love of All” is one of the best,
most powerful songs ever written about self-preservation and dignity.
It’s universal message crosses all boundaries, and instills one with the
hope that it’s not too late to better ourselves. to act kinder. Since,
Elizabeth, it’s impossible in the world we live in to empathize with
others, we can always empathize with ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s an important message, crucial, really,
and it’s beautifully stated on the album.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Not the face, you bitch. Not the fucking
face, you piece of bitch trash!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I want a firm commitment.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I think, Evelyn, that we’ve…lost touch.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Why? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: My need to engage in homicidal behavior on
a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to
fulfill my needs.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to
talk about?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It’s over, Evelyn. It’s all over</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Touchy, touchy. I’m sorry I brought the
wedding up. Let’s just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having
coffee?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m fucking serious. It’s fucking over. Us.
This is no joke. I don’t think we should see each other anymore.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: But your friends are my friends. My friends
are your friends. I don’t think it would work. You have a little
something on your upper lip.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I know that your friends are my friends.
I’ve thought about that. You can have them.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You’re really serious, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: But what about the past? Our past?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: We never really shared one.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You’re inhuman.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m…in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I’m
sorry. You’re just not terribly important to me.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I know my behavior is…erratic
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What do you want me to do, what is it you
want?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: If you really want to do something for me,
you can stop making this scene right now.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Oh God, I can’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m leaving now. I’ve assessed the
situation and I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m just leaving.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: But where?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I have to return some videotapes.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Here kitty, kitty.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Oh my God! Stop that! What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cop car</strong>: Halt. Put down your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: Bateman flees from the scene. The camera
follows him as he runs along a row of Porsches, trying to open each one,
setting off a cacophony of CAR ALARMS. THE SOUND OF POLICE SIRENS draws
near.</p>
<p><strong>new angle</strong>: He runs, panting, until he ends up in
front of a tail, brilliantly lit office building. As he approaches, the
lights in the building are going off floor by floor.</p>
<p><strong>night watchman</strong>: Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Smith?
You forgot to sign in.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Harold, it’s Bateman. Patrick Bateman.
You’re my lawyer so I think you should know-I’ve killed a lot of people.
Some escort girls, in an apartment uptown, some homeless people, maybe
five or ten, an NYU girl I met in Central Park. I left her in a parking
lot, near Dunkin’ Donuts. I killed Bethany, my old girlfriend, with a
nail gun. and a man, some old faggot with a dog. Last week I killed
another girl with a chainsaw-I had to, she almost got away There was
someone else there, maybe a model, I can’t remember but she’s dead too.
And Paul Owen. I killed Paul Owen with an ax, in the face. His body is
dissolving in a bathtub in Hell’s Kitchen. I don’t want to leave
anything out here…I guess I’ve killed 20 people, maybe 40-I have tapes
of a lot of it. Some of the girls have seen the tapes, I even… well, I
ate some of their brains and I tried to cook a little. Tonight I just,
well, I had to kill a lot of people and I’m not sure I ’m going to get
away with it this time-I mean I guess I’m a pretty sick guy. So-if you
get hack tomorrow, I may show up at Harry’s Bar, so, you know, keep your
eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: No hash browns?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Not in the mood, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: But…everyone orders the hash browns here. I
mean- it’s-have you been here before?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes, of course. The hash browns are
delicious. I’m just…not… ordering them.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Suit yourself, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: So, the night he disappeared? Any new
thoughts on what you did?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m not really sure. I had a shower…and
some sorbet?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I think maybe you’ve got your dates mixed
up.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: But how? Where do you place Paul that
night?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: According to his date book, and this was
verified by his secretary, he had dinner with…Marcus Halberstam.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I’ve questioned him.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Marcus?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he
couldn’t be sure.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: But Marcus denied it?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Well, does Marcus have an alibi?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: He does? You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: I checked it out. It’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Where was Marcus?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: He wasn’t with Paul Owen.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: So who was he with?</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott,
Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and � - you.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh, right. Of course…We had wanted Paul
Owen to come. But he said he had plans…I guess I had dinner with
Victoria…the following night.</p>
<p><strong>kimball</strong>: Personally I think the guy went a little
nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing.
Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I’m pretty sure he’ll turn up sooner or
later. I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no
reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn’t that right,
Patrick?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: What can I do for you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right
now.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Mrs. Wolfe?</p>
<p><strong>doorman</strong>: The real estate agent? You do have an
appointment, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wolfe</strong>: Are you my two o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wolfe</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m looking for…Paul Owen’s…place.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Doesn’t he live here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wolfe</strong>: No, he doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wolfe</strong>: You saw the ad in the Times?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No. Yes. I mean yes, I did. In the Times.
But… doesn’t Paul Owen still live here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wolfe</strong>: There was no ad in the Times.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wolfe</strong>: I think you should go now.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: But I think…I want to know what happened
here.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wolfe</strong>: Don’t make any trouble. Please. I
suggest you go.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wolfe</strong>: Don’t come back.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I won’t…don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: Hey, Kinsley.</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: See you at Fluties, okay?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Patrick Bateman’s office.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Jean? Hello? Jean?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Patrick? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Hello? Jean, I need help!</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Jean-I’m not-</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you
and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry’s for drinks.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Oh God, what did you say, you dumb
bitch?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Patrick? I can’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What are I doing?</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Where are you? Patrick, what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I don’t think I’m gonna make it, Jean.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: …to the office this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Just…say…no!</p>
<p><strong>jean</strong>: What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m not going anywhere unless we have a
reservation.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the
suspenders.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He
approaches Carnes cautiously.</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: Face it-the Japanese will own most of this
country by the end of the ’90s.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Shut up, Carnes, they will not.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: So, Harold, did you get my message?</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That
was you, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Yes, naturally.</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls?
Oh that s fabulous. That’s rich…</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: It was a pretty long message, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What exactly do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: The message you left.</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: By the way Davis, how is Cynthia? You’re
still seeing her, right?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: But wait, Harold, what do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: Excuse me. Nothing. Good to see you. Is that
Edward Towers?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Carnes? Wait.</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: Davis. I’m not one to bad-mouth anyone, your
joke was amusing. But come on, man, you had one fatal flaw: Bateman’s
such a dork, such a boring, spineless lightweight, that I couldn’t fully
appreciate it. I wasn’t fooled for a second. Now, if you’d said Price,
or McDermott…Otherwise, it was amusing. Now, let’s have lunch or dinner
or something. Hilarious, Davis. A killer.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: What are you talking about? Bateman is
what?</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: Oh Christ. He can barely pick up an escort
girl, let alone…what was it you said he did to her?</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: Now, if you’ll excuse me, I really must…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Wait. Stop. You don’t seem to understand.
You’re not really comprehending any of this. I killed him. I did it,
Carnes. I’m Patrick Bateman. I chopped Owen’s fucking head off. I
tortured dozens of girls. The whole message I left on your machine was
true.</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: Excuse me. I really must he going.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No! Listen, don’t you know who I am? I’m
not Davis, I’m Patrick Bateman! I talk to you on the phone all the time!
Don’t you recognize me? You’re my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Now, Carnes, listen to me. Listen very,
very carefully. I killed Paul Owen and I liked it. I can’t make myself
any clearer</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: But that’s simply not possible. And I don’t
find this funny anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: It never was supposed to he! Why isn’t it
possible?</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: It’s just not.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Why not, you stupid bastard?</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: Because I had dinner with Paul Owen twice in
London…just ten days ago.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: No, you…didn’t?</p>
<p><strong>carnes</strong>: Now, if you’ll excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: How can he lie like that? How can he pull
that shit?</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: What shit? Now where do we have
reservations at? I mean I’m not really hungry, but I would like to have
reservations somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I don’t believe it. He looks so…normal. He
seems so… out of it. So…undangerous.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: I just don’t see how someone, anyone, can
appear that way and yet be involved in such total shit. How can you be
so fucking, I don’t know, cool about it?</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Some guys are just born cool, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: And Bateman, what are YOU SO fucking zany
about?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: I’m just a happy camper. Rockin’ and
a-rollin’.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Rehab’s done wonders for you, pal.
Working for UNICEF now?</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Oh brother look-he presents himself as a
harmless Old codger. But inside…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: But inside…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: But inside doesn’t matter…</p>
<p><strong>price</strong>: Bateman? Come on, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>van patten</strong>: Whose moronic idea was it to drink dry
beers? I need a Scotch.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: There are no more barriers to cross. All I
have in common with the uncontrollable and the insane, the vicious and
the evil, all the mayhem I have caused and my utter indifference toward
it, I have now surpassed…</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: My pain is constant and sharp and I do not
hope for a better world for anyone. I fact I want my pain to be
inflicted on others. I want no escape.</p>
<p><strong>int. harry’s bar - early evening</strong>: As the film ends
the camera moves CLOSE on Bateman. He is leaning back in his leather
armchair, drinking a double Scotch, his eyes blank.</p>
<p><strong>bateman</strong>: But even after admitting this, there is no
catharsis. I gain no deeper knowledge about myself, no new knowledge can
be extracted from my telling. There has been no reason for me to tell
you any of this. This confession has meant nothing…</p>
