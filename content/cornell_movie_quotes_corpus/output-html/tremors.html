<p><strong>wd6</strong>: 6/21/88</p>
<p><strong>old fred</strong>: How’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: She wants to lay down. I’m a little
worried.</p>
<p><strong>old fred</strong>: Well, I brung her something I know she
likes.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: Damn, Fred, you can’t give away all
those.</p>
<p><strong>old fred</strong>: Forget it. I got vegetables coming out my
ears. Usually the varmints eat up half my crop, but lately I ain’t so
much as seen a gopher or a jack-rabbit nowheres.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: If that ain’t the truth. And I count on them
for a little bit of stew meat…Thank you, Fred.</p>
<p><strong>old fred</strong>: We playing cards tonight?</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: I think I’m gonna be sitting up with her.</p>
<p><strong>old fred</strong>: I’d do the same. Well, catch you
Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p><strong>edgar</strong>: What in the name of Jehovah…?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Bassett, this is your wake-up
call. Please move your fat ass.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You dumb shit.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You didn’t cook breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Did it yesterday. Franks and beans.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No…it was eggs. I did eggs.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Hell you did. Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: How many cows does it take to make a stampede?
Is it like three or more? Is there a minimum speed?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I was in one. A bolt of lightning blew up
cottonwood tree. Three hundred head going hell-bent for the horizon.
Wasn’t so damn funny, I can tell you.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: If there was one nearby I’d probably ask
him.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I keep thinking, if we were but half serious
about money, we should quit being hired hands and…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Handymen, Earl. We’re handymen.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Whatever the hell we are, we should quit and
go get ourselves some real employment.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What, and give up all this personal
freedom?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Goddamn jeep trail gets worse every year.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Has a lot of rain.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re gonna get us hung up.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Do not talk to the driver.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What do we have next?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Uh…Digging that waterhole for Nestor.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Burt and Heather’s place is closer. Let’s do
their kitchen today. Do Nestor tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Nestor’s out of town tomorrow. We don’t dig
today. We don’t get paid today. Damn it, Valentine, you never plan
ahead. You never take the long view. Hell, here it is Monday and I’m
already working on Wednesday. It is Monday, right?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Who the hell’s that? That’s not what’s his
name…the grad student?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Nah, it’s September. Must be the new one.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: The new one! That’s supposed to be a girl!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Hi, I’m Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck. I’m up here
for the semester…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah, geography.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Right, geology. And you have to be Val and
Earl. I’ve heard all about you.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We deny everything.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Listen, got a question for you. Do you know
if anybody is doing any blasting or drilling or anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Around here? Why would they?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Well, I’m supposed monitor these
seismographs. You know, they measure vibrations…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah, vibrations in the ground.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Yeah, well, I’m getting what I refer to
scientifically as “weird vibes.” every sensor I’ve got is giving me
strange readings. I mean, the school has had these machines up here
three years and they’ve never recorded anything like this.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, we’ll ask around. Let you know if we
hear of anything.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Thanks. God, I hope they’re not screwed up.
I might have to bag the whole semester. Anyway, sorry to bother you.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No problem. Nice meeting you. Hope you get it
sorted out.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You know, if you wanted, we could take a look
at those seismographs for her.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What the hell do we know about
seismographs?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Nothing. But it sure might be a nice way of
getting to know her.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Goddamnit, Valentine, you won’t go for any gal
unless she fits that damn list of yours A to Z…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well, sure.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: …And is dumber than my hind end. Like that
Bobby Lynn Dexter…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Tammy Lynn Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Don’t matter. They’re all the same: dead
weight. Can’t make a decision, can’t walk because of their shoes, can’t
work because of their fingernails. Make my skin crawl!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well, I’m a victim of circumstance.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I thought you called it your pecker. Look,
don’t make the mistake I made. Twenty years of looking for a woman
exactly like Miss October 1968, and where’d it get me? Here with
you.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Melvin, touch that truck and die.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Oh, man, I’m really shaking.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: No, Pham, they’re not hollow points. I ordered
hollow points and that’s what I want.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hi, guys, what you been up to?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Ran into the new college student, Rona.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck. She’s getting some kind
of strange readings on her things.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or
uranium or something out there…next thing the Feds will be at our door.
“Sorry, time to move. Eminent domain.”</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Down, honey, down.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah, Burt. The way you worry, you’re gonna
have a heart attack before you get to survive World War</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: Hey Val, listen. Bearing going out, you
think?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Catch it later, Pham. Gotta get over to
Nestor’s.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Right. We plan ahead. That way we don’t do
anything right now. Earl explained it to me.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: A beauty, isn’t it? We bought three of them
for the rec room.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: We sell ’em to you for three bucks a piece!</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: And I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: You don’t get it, Pham. The idea was: we were
ripping you off.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Melvin, you little pain-in-the-ass!</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: It wasn’t me, man! Your truck’s just screwed
up, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Why don’t his parents ever take him to Vegas
with them?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You gotta ask that?</p>
<p><strong>nestor</strong>: It came out great, boys. Should fill up just
fine come the next rain. Lemme have your bill.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah, Nestor, we know. Don’t worry about it.
Catch us when you can.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No, we’re not too easy-going. This area is
economically depressed.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: So what if we just did it…today. Pack up. Drive
straight down to Bixby. Get serious.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We could. We could. But we’d have to get
really serious. It’s gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: So? That car wash pays good, and they’re always
looking.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Car wash?! That’s got no future. If we’re
gonna take the plunge we oughta have a better plan than that.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah, sure. Go ahead and plan it…for a year or
two.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Stop it! Stop it, you horrid animal! I’m
going to give her back to my son. I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Hey, Viola, you’ve got my permission.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: God almighty, my mama sure didn’t raise me for
this.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well, you’re the one won’t work in the car
wash. You’re the one’s gotta have a plan.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Damn it, Val! Not having a plan is what keeps
us doing jobs like this!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What keeps us doing jobs like this is you
dragging your feet. I was up for going to Bixby. I was getting
excited.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: In the past year I must’ve said a hundred
times “We gotta get out of Perfection. We gotta better ourselves.” You
gonna stand there in broad daylight and tell me you think I’m the reason
we’re still here? You want to know how close I am to going to Bixby
right now?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I’ll call that little bluff. How close?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Uh oh, it’s Nancy. She wants another load of
firewood.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Forget it, man. It’s not worth it.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: She’s got us. Now, listen, the plan is: we
have done our last job in Perfection.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: That’s the plan.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mindy, honey, don’t pogo in the street. Hey,
guys, I’ve got a job for you…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Sorry, Nancy. We ain’t doing odd jobs anymore.
We’re headed for Bixby permanent.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Oh, sure… …My God, you really are!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yep, we’re relocating to an area with a greater
economic base. Hey, Mindy, what’s the count?</p>
<p><strong>mindy</strong>: Six hundred three, six hundred four, six
hundred five…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Go for it!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Gee, guys. I made the big decision. I’m
putting in that satellite dish. I was going to offer you five hundred
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We did it! We faced temptation and we did not
bend!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Damn straight! Now there’s nothing between us
and Bixby but nothing!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Last time we hit that goddamn pothole!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: So long, cactus!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Adios, bridge!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Last time down this damn twisty road!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Last chance, asshole. Run, run…!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Okay, here’s the plan. We bust our tails in
the car wash six months… well, maybe nine…and we don’t spend a dime, you
know? And then we go for it…down payment on a tow-truck or a back-hoe or
something, right? Start a real business. We can start looking for
something today, tonight!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Jeez, look at that guy.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: One job I’d never take is working around
electricity.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Especially when it’s two hundred feet off the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re full of shit.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: He’s only got one damn jacket. That’s him, I’m
telling you.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Man, oh, man. He must’ve really been drunk
this time. Edgar! What the hell you doing? Get on down from there!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well, shit, we can’t leave him up there.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Real sorry to bother you, Megan, but we figured
since Jim’s a doctor…</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: No, it’s fine. You did the right thing. When
Jim is done we’ll call the Coroner’s office in Bixby. We’ll take care of
it. Poor Edgar.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, I see you got all the wallboard up.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: That was easy. You two did the hard part.
Sure sorry you’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Was is a heart attack?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: He died of dehydration. Thirst.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: But that doesn’t make sense. That takes a
couple of days, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Three or four even.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You mean he sat up there three or four days?
Just sat there till he died of thirst?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Reckon he hated Perfection more than us? You
suppose he wanted to kill himself?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: If he did, why didn’t he use his damn
shotgun?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Maybe he just couldn’t pull the trigger…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Oh sure, he figured it was easier to die of
thirst? Come on, sombody must’ve chased him up there.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Oh, you mean somebody who ain’t scared of a
twelve gauge shotgun. And then what did they do? Camp out down below and
just wait for him to die?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well, whatever the hell happened it’s just one
more goddamn good reason to haul ass out of this place.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Probably up a pole starving itself to
death.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Okay, the plan is: pedal to the metal the
whole way. We don’t stop till we hit the carwash, not even to pee.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I’ll go with that plan.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Hey, Old Fred! Fred! Where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Not here.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Oh, Jesus!!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What the hell is going on? I mean</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You guys better get the hell outta here! We
got a killer on the loose!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: A murderer, man! A real psycho. He’s cutting
people’s heads off! I’m serious! I’d high-tail for town if I was
you!</p>
<p><strong>carmine</strong>: They’re drunk.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Carmine! What the hell is it?! Where are
you?</p>
<p><strong>nestor</strong>: His head? You mean just his head?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah, really sick, man. Sweet Old Fred.</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: Something happen to Fred?</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Are you serious, man? They killed him just
to take his sheep?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: He didn’t have nothing else to steal. Neither
did Edgar.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: What happened to Edgar?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I don’t believe this. The phone is out! Pham,
your phone is out!</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: I didn’t do it! What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>nestor</strong>: We’ve gotta get the police up here. You guys
gotta step on it to Bixby.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Consider it stepped on.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Brother, we decided to leave this place just
one day too late, you know?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, there’s sure as hell nothing to stop us
now. Everybody we know between here and Bixby is already dead.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Is some higher force at work, here? Are we
asking too much of life?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Those assholes are supposed to be fixing the
goddamn road! Hey! Where are you guys? People gotta use this road, you
know! You on a booze break or what?!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Val! Val!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Jesus! I don’t believe this!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re hung up again.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I am not!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re hung up I tell you. You’re gonna burn
the clutch.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hey, I don’t want spend the night out
here!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: What the hell you doing back already?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: You’re never going to believe this, but the
canyon road…we were on it not two hours ago…well, it’s completely…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: My God…!</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Unreal! Where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Uh…didn’t know we had it…</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Looks like…and eel.</p>
<p><strong>nestor</strong>: Naw…eels live in water.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: So…it’s some kind of snake?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Or a big mother slug maybe?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Some kind of mutation…?</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: Don’t touch, don’t touch.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: It’s dead all right. Tore the damn thing in
half.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: It must’ve grabbed us. That’s why the truck
stalled-out.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah! Next time I tell you I’m not hung
up…!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Stalled out your truck? Have to be one strong
son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: I give you boys five dollars for it.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Twenty.</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: Okay, ten dollars.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: Okay, fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Damn right fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Just one of these couldn’t eat up off a whole
flock of sheep. There’s gotta be more out there, a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Slick as snot and I’m not lying.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Fifteen lousy bucks.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: A man who plans ahead.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: …Look, we organize, we arm ourselves. We go
out, we find those damn snake things, we make ’em extinct.</p>
<p><strong>nestor</strong>: Come on, Burt, we don’t even know what they
are.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Might be aliens. Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Why go looking for trouble?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Miguel, the trouble’s come to us. If we’re not
ready…</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Phone’s out. Road’s out. We’re on our
own.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: And you two just love it, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Come on, Nancy, don’t let’s get personal.
We need to do something.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Damn right. You folks gotta analyze the
situation. With that road out we’re completely cut off. Got the cliffs
to the north, mountains east and west. That’s why Heather and me settled
here in the first place, geographic isolation.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Well…there must be dome way to get help.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Yes, that’s what I say.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: How, for chrissake? You gonna walk
thirty-eight miles to Bixby?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Hey, what about Pham Van’s saddle
horses?</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: You’re welcome to them. Does anybody know
how to ride?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m dead. Let’s finish in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: We have to go into Bixby in the morning. The
concrete blocks are in.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The con…! Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Just keep looking at that beautiful sky.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: That’s the sky that’s going to be over our
roof every night, when we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ah, but consider this, if we don’t finish the
roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: We could always buy a new generator.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Well, what’s wrong with it?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s…gone…!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: You sure this is where it was?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Am I sure?! It was right there. There’s the
cord.</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Well don’t then! You don’t want to fall
in.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What the…?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Come on. Get away from it!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: God, what a stink!</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Never mind! Let’s go! Let’s just go into town
or something! Jim, please!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You know, I bet it’s geological or something,
like natural gas, or a geyser. They stink like that. Remember in
Yellowstone…?</p>
<p><strong>megan</strong>: Stop it! Stop it! Somebody stop it…!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Pham, we don’t want to be stuck on a couple of
canners. They better be fast.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Relax. A snake thing like that couldn’t move
too quick.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Screw you. For all you know they could fly.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You want the rifle or the Smith?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: The rifle.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: You guys all set?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Ready as we’ll ever be.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Heather and I are going to drive around a
little, see if we can find that college girl and tell her to get her ass
back into town.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Good idea. And we’ll swing by the doctor’s
place. They were going to go into Bixby but we don’t know if they left
before the road was out.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Hold on. You guys oughta take something
that packs more punch than that thirty-thirty. Take one of our Browning
autos, or even my model seventy… It’s three-seventy-five H and H
mag.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Gee…thanks, Heather. Hope we don’t need
it.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: IT’S GOT ME! IT’s GOT ME! AAAAHGH!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: You stupid punk! You came that close, that
close!!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: One of these days, Melvin, somebody’s gonna
kick your ass.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Well…you fellas watch yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Come back with the Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>nestor</strong>: Sheriff, like hell. Come back with the
National Guard.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You know, we can’t possibly make Bixby by
nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: That means we’re gonna be out here, like, in
the dark.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Hey, doctor, anybody here?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Oh, man, I hate this shit.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Car’s gone. We just missed them, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Then where’s the goddamn Conway Twitty coming
from?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Here’s the plan…We don’t even stop. Ride like
hell. Tonight we keep right on going. We’ll walk the horses.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: That is the plan…I mean, goddamn it! What the
hell are those things? How could they bury an entire Plymouth station
wagon?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Why would they do it?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I knew it! Pham Van wouldn’t know a decent
horse if…!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Shut up! They got wind of something they don’t
like!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Oh shit!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah…yeah. What about the hor…?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: That’s how they get you! They’re under the
goddamn ground!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What the hell are they?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Sons of bitches!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Nope…just one.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: It’s gaining on us!!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We can do it, we can do it!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Stupid son of a bitch…knocked itself cold.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Cold, my ass! It’s dead! We killed the
bastard!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Hi, guys, how’re you doing? Look, can I ask
you something? Did you just notice something weird? Vibrations? You
know, some kind of earth tremor?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Jesus Christ…think it smells like that ’cause
it’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: I don’t see any eyes…must be totally
subterranean…and those tentacles…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook
you, and pull you right in. Good thing we stopped it before it killed
anybody else.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Yeah, I’m lucky it didn’t find me. This is
important, you know. This is like, well, let’s say it, it’s probably the
biggest zoological discovery of the century. The century? Forget it.
History.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I got it! Here’s the other end! Just look at
what we caught here!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: This is one big mother!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: So this is the guy that had your seismos
working overtime?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hey, Rhonda, you ever heard of anything like
this before?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Sure, Earl, everybody knows about them. We just
didn’t tell you. Come on, nobody’s ever seen one of these! We’re really
in on something here!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Pham Van don’t get his mitts on this for no
measly fifteen bucks!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: You got that right!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Here’s the plan: we’ll get a…a flatbed, I
guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Naw, don’t want to winch it. That’d tear it all
up. Want to lift it. Some kind of crane with lifting straps.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Hey, hey, shut up! The way I figure it.
There are five more of these things!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Five more?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Yeah, darn it, look. I’ve got seismographs
all over the valley. If you compare the different readings, there have
to be five. Here’s one at two o’clock yesterday, but here’s another one
three miles away at the same time. So that’s two. Now, here…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: We’ll take your word for it.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah. Where’s your truck?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: The other side of that dome.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Prairie dog burrow…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Little sons of bitches.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, at least the bastard can’t climb. Pardon
my French.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Probably couldn’t move too easily on the
surface.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: God, the live ones smell worse tan the dead
ones.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Okay, now, how far’s your truck?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I don’t know. If this one’s any faster than
that other one…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I think we wait right here.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: There’s nothing like them in the fossil
record, I’m sure…Okay, so they predate the fossil record… That’d make
them a couple of billion years old…and we’ve just never seen one till
now. Right.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’d vote for outer space. No way those are
local boys.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Atomic testing. Or, no, bio- engineering! The
government built them, a big surprise in the next war.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well…haven’t seen a sign for hours. Maybe it’s
long gone.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Maybe it is. Why don’t you take a little stroll
and see?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Fuck you, too. Pardon my French.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Well, we’ve got to do something.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Watch yourself! It’s got a good six foot
reach.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Son of a goddamned bitch! Been waiting there
all this time. How the hell’s it even know we’re still here?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: It’s been listening to us. It’s got no eyes. It
sure as hell can’t smell anything underground, so I figure…</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Of course! It can sense the slightest
seismic vibration…hear every move we make. Especially on this rock. It’s
a perfect conductor.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You know, I hate to be crude, but I’m gonna
have to take care of some business here.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Same here.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Darn it!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Yeah. But I’ll tell you, if you ever wanted
proof God is a man, this is it.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: No problem. Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, folks, what’s the plan?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: First let’s see if Stumpy’s still out
there.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Don’t he have a home to go to?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well, that’s why Edgar never got down off that
tower.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: I might have an idea…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We’re gonna have to come up with some kind of
plan or it’s just gonna wait us to death.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Well, I was wondering if we could…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well, let’s just run for it. We outran that one
yesterday, at least on a sprint.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Run for it? Running’s not a plan. Running is
what you do when the plan fails. You’re not even trying to come up with
a plan!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well, it’s not like we’ve got a hell of a lot
of options…</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: You guys know how to pole vault?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Stay on those residual boulders!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Think it’s still following us?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Let’s assume that it is.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: And once we hit that truck we gotta go fast. I
say we all jump together.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah. One, two, three…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Come on, girl, it ain’t gonna give us much
time…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: We better get everybody together.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You go north, I’ll go south.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’ll bet you’re sorry the college ever sent
you up here.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Well, I’m scared, but I’m not sorry.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You know, Val went to that college, too. For a
whole year. Couldn’t quite sit still for it, though. Had too much
vinegar in his system. But once he settles down, forgets this cowboy
stuff, he’ll be one in a million.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: You serious, Val? You think we’re not even
safe here in town?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Ask me that after you meet one. I think we
should all get the hell out while the getting’s good.</p>
<p><strong>nestor</strong>: Why not just take a Number Ten pick axe and
give it one good whack…?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Nestor, damn it, these things are bigger than
an Airstream trailer!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: God, I’ve got to find Mindy.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hey, Pham, where’s Burt and Heather?</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: Can’t raise them. I guess they’re still
out there somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: If you’ve got a radio, why aren’t you
calling somebody in Bixby? The police or…</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: Can’t reach outside the valley. You know,
because of the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Hey, Rhonda, what’s the name you call those
things, huh?</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: Where’d they come from?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Huh? I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: You’re a scientist, right?</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: You should have a theory at least.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Look, these things are absolutely
unprecedented!</p>
<p><strong>nestor</strong>: Yeah, but where’d they come from?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Where’d they come from? Okay, worms,
probably in the Jurassic period. Cosmic radiation was much higher
then…so they mutated…and they got so big they just sank right into the
ground and fell asleep… But now continental drift has brought them to
the surface, ready to be harvested by the ancient alien meat growers who
planted them here.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re right, don’t matter where they come
from.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Right. We need to be talking about what we’re
gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: My goodness, Valentine, once they see the
road is out and the phone lines are down, someone will be along to look
in on us. Don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: No no no, they listen! They can sense the
slightest vibration through the ground. That’s how they see! That’s how
they hunt!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: So, like we don’t vibrate, right? Maybe they
won’t even come to here, huh? Maybe they leave us alone.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: They caught up with Edgar here. They grabbed
Old Fred here. They nailed the asshole dog here. And the doctor’s place
is here…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You little ass wipe! You knock that off or
you’re gonna be shitting that basketball! Pardon my French.</p>
<p><strong>nestor</strong>: Now, Val, let’s assume they’re as dangerous
as you say. Where are we going to go that’s safer than right here?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Rhonda’s got an idea about that.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Yes, see, they move very easily through the
Pleistocene Alluvials… …the dirt…the loose soil that makes up the valley
floor. But they can’t move through solid rock. I think we should travel
west to the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You know, up the jeep trail.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: The mountains are solid granite. We’d be
safe there, and we could hike along them…all the way to Bixby if we have
to.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mindy! Mindy!</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: No, Valentine, I’m not leaving my place.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well, it’s gonna take us days to get back with
help.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Doggone it, Viola, it’s just plain crazy to
stay.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’m gonna kick his ass!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I’m gonna help you.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Jesus Christ! Man, you gut a gun?!</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: Big as a house! What are we gonna
do…?!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Quiet! QUIET!!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Remember…no noise. No vibration.</p>
<p><strong>mindy!</strong>: Get off your pogo stick! Get in here, girl!
Run, Mindy!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Mindy! Mindy!</p>
<p><strong>mindy</strong>: Oww! Val, you hurt me…!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Go back, for chrissake!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We gotta get him off there. It’ll suck that
truck down!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Oh, Jesus. Rhonda, another one!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Come on! Outta your pants!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Come on! Come on! Don’t look back! Just run!
Run like screaming fuck!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Pardon my French.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: You paying attention? This oughta hurt like
hell.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: It does.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: First time for me.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: So what are we gonna do, you know? How long
till they go away?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: They got the patience of Job. They just sit
and goddamn wait til they hear something that sounds like lunch. We need
a plan.</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: I’ve got a plan. You and Val take your
truck, get to the mountains. Hike to Bixby. Get us some help.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Those scumsuckers are my radials, Pham!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Well, we can take my truck then.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No good. You need major four- wheel-drive just
to get up that jeep trail.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Quiet! Quiet you hateful thing…!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Shut it up! Shut the little bastard up!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Chuck him out the door! Like a little hors
d’oeuvre.</p>
<p><strong>viola</strong>: Get away! Get away! Oh God in heaven, help
me!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Son of a bitchin’ lowlife, putrid, scum…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Gotta do something. Gotta get the bastards!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Man, what the hell can we do to those
things?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, we’re sure as hell not going to sit here
being quiet for God knows how long. Are we?</p>
<p><strong>pham van</strong>: Now wait a minute, Earl. I got enough food
here to last us for weeks. Those damn things can’t wait around forever.
We can do it. I mean, if we have to, right?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Jesus! Shut it off!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Everybody! This way! The roof!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Rhonda! Keep moving. Don’t stop!</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Hey! What’s going on, man?! What the hell
you doing up there…?!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Melvin, shut the hell up!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Nancy! Nestor!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Get up on your roof! On your roof! They can
come through the floor!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Can’t you shout a little quieter?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I can’t believe it. No tracks, no sign, no
spoor.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Yeah, whatever they are, you’d think after
they ate all those sheep they’d have to take a dump someplace… What the
hell’s going on in town?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hey, here’s the plan: Nestor’s Cadillac. His
tires are nine hundred sixteens. We sprint for it, grab the spare, put
it on our truck with our spare.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: How the hell long it take you to change a
tire?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Just about too damn long. Bolt pattern’s
probably wrong anyway.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: We need another plan.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Yo, P.V., Burt here. Come back.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Pham? Anybody copy?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Burt, now listen. We found out what’s been
killing people. Over?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Negative copy on that, Pham, check your
frequency. I’m on forty-nine.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Burt, can you hear me now?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Just barely, Pham. What are you all doing up
on your roofs. What the hell’s going on? Come back.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Oh man, they’re going, man! I think they’re
going for Burt!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Burt! This is Val! Get out of your basement!!
Take your radio! You and Heather get up on your roof! Then we’ll talk,
okay?!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Val? What the hell you doing back already?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Burt, get out! Get up on your roof or
someplace! We found out what’s been killing people! They’re under the
ground!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: What’s under the ground? We’re not getting up
on the roof. Earth shelter’s the best. Known that since I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Listen! Listen! We know what they are! They’re
big things under the ground! Much bigger than we thought! They’re coming
after you! They’re coming right now!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: We don’t see anything, Val. Now what the hell
are you talking about? Over.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: They’re coming underground! They …they can dig
like a son of a bitch…Big monsters under the ground, Burt! Now get the
hell out! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Jesus Chri…!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Broke into the wrong goddamn rec room, didn’t
you, you BASTARD!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Uh…roger that, Burt. Uh, congratulations. Uh,
be advised, however, there are four more, repeat, four more
motherfuckers. Come back.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: They got one! They killed one of the sons of
bitches!</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Way to go, dudes!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, I guess we don’t get to make fun of
Burt’s lifestyle anymore, huh?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Burt, any chance you can get the rest of
them?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: One second, Val.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: You’re not getting any penetration, even
with the elephant gun.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Damn! Val, we can’t get them. Never figured on
having to shoot through dirt! Best goddamn bullet stop there is. Come
back.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Okay, Burt, listen. Forget shooting them. Tell
me this: can you get to your truck?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Good. You’ve got the only truck in the valley
that can make it up that damn jeep trail. So, here’s the plan: You and
Heather go for help. Get to the mountains…</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Hey, guys! They’re up to something.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What’s it doing?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Why do you all keep asking me?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Hey, there’s another one coming!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What the hell was that all about?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: They weren’t making no noise. Why they
bothering them for?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: They’re studying the buildings… trying to
figure them out.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Yeah, they’re confused. They can feel our
vibrations, but they can’t find us.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: They’re working together, too.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah, like they got a plan…</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Breaker there, Earl. What do you want us to
do?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hang on, Burt. The bastards are up to
something.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Oh, wow, man! No way! No fucking way,
man…!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: They knocked his place down on purpose, man.
They’re gonna tear this whole town out from under us!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Burt! Heather!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah, Val.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: We’re in deep shit over here. Let’s change that
plan.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Knock it off, Burt!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: I think I scared it!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Forget going for help. We’ll all be dead long
before you get back.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: We’re here, Val. Just tell us what you
need. Come back.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: They’re tearing down the houses here! We all
gotta get outta here together! Now!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: We’re with you, Val. We’ll come get
everybody. Just hang on tight.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Val, we’re going to have to forget about
the truck…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah, Heather, we got you.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Hey, you better think of something, man! You
gotta do something!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: You and Val, man!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What?!! Since when the hell’s every goddamn
thing up to us?!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: You guys do all the odd jobs.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We don’t have a hell of a lot of time
here.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Look, the situation hasn’t changed. We still
have to get to solid rock. There must be some way!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Like what?! There’s nothing left that’ll make
it to the mountains!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Hey, Val, quiet, man!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: We need a helicopter is what we need, or a
goddamn tank…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Wait a minute…the Cat. Could we take the
Cat?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Jesus. It’s slower than hell.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah, but it weighs better than thirty tons.
No way they could stop it.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: We can’t all fit on that bulldozer.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: But…we could pull something! We could, I don’t
know, drag a car behind it!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: A car, huh? Like a big armored car? Need
something bigger, tougher…our truck maybe…or, hell, that old semi
trailer!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Its tires are flat…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Doesn’t matter. The cat can pull anything.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well…all right! We just roll on out of
here!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We got a plan!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Listen, they only respond to vibration,
right? Couldn’t we… distract them somehow?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah, good! Something to keep them busy. We
need a decoy.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hey, Melvin, you wanna make a buck?</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Hey, how about the tractor? Start him up.
Let him go by itself. Let those things chase it all over is they like
that noise.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Not bad. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I think the ground’s getting closer. I think we
do it. We’re gonna save our asses here!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Wait! How are you going to know they’re all
following it?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We got two right here.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: There’s one. I think one.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Burt, Heather, we got a little sort of a plan
going here, maybe. Can you tell if you’ve still got any of those things
out at your place? Come back.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Yeah, still got one poking around.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: That’s four. Let us know if it starts moving,
Burt.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: I’m making the run to the Cat.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Like hell you are.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Get real. I’m faster than you.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I’m best at driving the Cat.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Only if something happens to me.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Yeah, well, you’re half right.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I won. I pick who does it.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: There they go! They’re chasing it!</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: It’s going… There goes this one! It’s
going!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Hey, this guy just took off like a shot.
What’d you people do?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Watch your ass, shithead.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Don’t worry about me, jerkoff.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: He’ll never make it! They’re gonna get
him!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: It worked! They can’t find him! Okay,
okay…uh…we gotta make some noise…a lot of noise! HEY,</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: That did it, girl! Goddamn good thinking!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Don’t worry. No way they can lift that tower.
I mean it’s really heavy.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: They’re not trying to lift it!</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Way to go! Dumb fucking worms! Now haul ass
over here, man! Me next! Get me off of here…!</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Oh shit! Oh, God! Help!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: We got about three seconds!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well, come on!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: God damn! Armored transport!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Let’s go you two. We’re headed for the
mountains.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: In a minute.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Come on, Burt, we can’t hold still long.
They’re damn smart and getting smarter by the minute.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: That’s fine. We’ve got some new things to
teach them.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Damn it! They’ll sink this rig just like a
boat!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: See that? They’re doing it now! They try it
every time we hold still.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Jesus Christ, we’re only going nine miles. Be
there in two hours, tops!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Yeah, well those things are gonna be on our
ass every foot of the way, right?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: What do you think? Max firepower or…?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’d go for penetration. The 458 shooting
solids – less ammo to carry anyway.</p>
<p><strong>townsfolk</strong>: Come on! Who cares! Forget it! Let’s
go!</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Give me a gun! I’ll take one!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: I wouldn’t give you a gun if it was World War
Three.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Food for five years. A thousand gallons of
gas. Air filtration. Water filtration. Geiger counter. Bomb shelter…
…underground goddamn monsters?!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Any sign of’em?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Maybe they just gave up, you know.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Yeah, the bulldozer’s too much for them,
man.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: There we go, solid rock!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Is it them?</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: What else could it be?</p>
<p><strong>mindy</strong>: What’re they doing?</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Maybe they’re taking a dump.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: We’re not going over there, right?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No. We go straight.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Damn it. What the hell are they doing? They’re
up to something.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t care what they’re doing as long as
they’re doing it way over there.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: They…they dug a trap! I can’t believe this!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Hungry?! Eat this!!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: There they are!</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: Hey, Burt…did you get one…!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: No, there’s still four of them. See…there’s
like four different dust trails.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Sure got their attention, though. Nice going,
Burt. Earl, what about the Cat?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No way. It’s down for the count.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Here they come! They’re coming back!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Come on, everybody! We gotta run for those
rocks over there!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Jesus, Val, it’s pretty far.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Yeah, man! They’ll get us!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: There sure as hell get us if we stay here!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Wait, wait, listen. Burt do you have any
more of those things?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: The bombs? Damn right I do.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Well, what is you throw one that way, the
way we want to go… Then, when the explosion happens… if it drives them
away again…we all run like goddamn bastards! Pardon my French.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: What if it doesn’t scare them? What if they
don’t run?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: I don’t think it does scare them! It hurts
them! They’re so sensitive to sound, they have to run! It hurts too
much!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: She’s got my vote.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Right. We’re gonna run. Get ready.</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: I don’t know, man. They’re too fast! You
can’t outrun them, no way!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Here, kid. This’ll make’em think twice.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: It worked! There they go!</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: Burt, you bastard!</p>
<p><strong>melvin</strong>: You asshole! There’s no bullets in this
gun!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Got you moving, didn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: So…now what?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Could we make it to the mountains?</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: No way. We’d need fifty of those things.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Well…that’s it. We’re not getting off this
rock…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Not going to pole vault anywhere. That’s for
sure.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: What’s the matter with you? What are you
talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: They’ll just wait out there till we’re dead.
That’s what they do.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: What? Well, for chrissake, we could have made
a stand at our place! We had food, water…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You can’t fight’em that way…</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: You two jackasses hauled us way the hell out
here…!?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Well, who put you two in charge?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Burt! Those animals would have killed
you!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: They’d have dug your place out from under you
in half an hour!</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: If it comes to starvation, I know what I’m
doing. Take one of these. Walk right out there with the fuse lit. Stuff
it down my pants and let ’em take me down. BOOOOM!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Jesus, honey!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You know, that’s not a bad idea!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No, I mean, it gives me an idea… going fishing
like…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: There! Right straight out in front of you.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: How much you think?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know… They’re pretty quick…fifteen
seconds?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What the hell is that, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Cannon fuse.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What do you use it for?</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: My cannon.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Come on, you’re not going to do your lasso
thing…?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hey, just ’cause you’re no good with a
rope…</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Come on…come on…</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: Take it…take the bait…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Where the hell are they? Hope they didn’t wise
up.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Nope, there! That’s one.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Make noise. Everybody! COME ON!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: They’re not falling for it!</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’ll make’em pay attention goddamnit…</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: They’re…they’re trying to make us move!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Or just knock us over. Look, use the bomb!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: It’s out last one. We can’t kill them all.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Use the fucking bomb!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: So, we get back on that rock and in three days
we’re dead anyway.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I want to live for the three days.</p>
<p><strong>burt</strong>: What’s wrong? Use the bomb, for Godsake!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: No wait! This way!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What the hell are you doing?!!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: This better be one great plan!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Get ready!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Light it, man! LIGHT IT!!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Not yet, not yet…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Too far! You threw it behind them!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well, it just suddenly hit me, you know?
Stampede?</p>
<p><strong>mindy</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Road’s in!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Road’s in! Now, soon as we hit Bixby we start
making phone calls. We could make some real money off this whole thing,
get in People magazine…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: People? Hell, National Geographic.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Sell the movie rights. We’re going straight
from blue-collar to white -collar.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah…but no ties.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: No ties.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Hi, guys. Burt loaned me his camera.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Howdy, Rhonda.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: You’re really leaving, huh?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You bet. You gonna be staying up here?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Well, yeah! There’s going to be major
research up here. First thing is to get some pictures of that one we dug
up.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Well…you’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Well…see ya.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Christ, Val, maybe she’s not your type, but
you could, at least, be civil.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Civil? I’m civil.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You’re not civil, you’re glum. We got the
world by the tail with a downhill pull and all of a sudden you go glum
on me.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Somebody paying you to do this?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: She just practically asked you for a date.
What the hell is wrong?!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Earl, get real. What does she need with a guy
like me?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What was that? All this time she’s not good
enough for you. Now, suddenly, you’re not good enough for her? God, my
work is never done. You don’t decide is you’re worthless, she does. But
you gotta give her a chance!</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: Earl, I’m not gonna make a fool of myself! You
got that covered.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Fine, make the mistakes I did. I think I’ll
just be playing this hand myself.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: She likes both of us. We both helped her
out.</p>
<p><strong>val</strong>: You are so full of shit…</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Oh yeah? Think about this: She ain’t as
narrow-minded as you. I’ll lay odds she’s looking for character in a
man. For my part, I’d be proud to have her. I’d goddamn worship her.</p>
