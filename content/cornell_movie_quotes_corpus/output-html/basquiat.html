<p><strong>voice</strong>: Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh boat.
There’s no trip so horrible that someone won’t take it. The idea of the
unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret is a deliciously foolish
one. We must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh for really sending this
myth into orbit. How many pictures did he sell? One? He couldn’t give
them away. We are so ashamed of his life that the rest of art history
will be retribution for Van Gogh’s neglect. No one wants to be part of a
generation that ignores another Van Gogh.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: In this town one is at the mercy of the
recognition factor. One’s public appearance is absolute.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I consider myself a metaphor of the public. I
am a public eye. I am a witness.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Part of the artist’s job is to get the work
where I will see it.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: When you first see a new picture, you don’t
want to miss the boat. You have to be very careful because you may be
staring at Van Gogh’s ear.</p>
<p><strong>jean’s pov</strong>: His shoes pause next to the face in the
concrete.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: What’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Ummm. It’ll be great. We’ll live together
in peace. What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Gina. What’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Pancakes.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Hey - Willie Mays.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Willie Mays.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Nurse!!! Oh!!! Nurse!!! Carrot juice. Tofu
burger. Rapido!</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: We don’t serve that - amigo.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Fine… A greasy cheeseburger. Fries - and a
vodka.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic -
writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are..</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Who am I?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Oh yeah..</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: How’s the special today?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: It’s your stomach.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: It’s me. I’ve never been done in maple syrup.
Here’s a rag.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Gina?</p>
<p><strong>leshko</strong>: Alright. Look at you, staring at this girl,
making a mess.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: How about those pancakes?</p>
<p><strong>leshko</strong>: OK! Goodbye!</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.</p>
<p><strong>leshko</strong>: You nuts? Let him order? You on his side?
You’re not such a good waitress. You get out, too.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I just don’t think you’re being fair.</p>
<p><strong>leshko</strong>: I need this?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I need this?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Willie Mays.</p>
<p><strong>leshko</strong>: That’s right. You go with them. Make
babies</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Catch you later.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: What’s a job, anyway? What’s wrong with
you?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: No, don’t tell me - you just got fired by your
crazy boss.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I guess you did.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Guess I just got sick of him.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Can I walk you home?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I think I could do that alone.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Wait, I’m in a band….We’re at the Mudd
Club on Halloween. I’ll put you on the list.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I hate the Mudd Club.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Have you been camping? You could use a
scrub.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’m clean. Smell me. I always smell good.
I don’t know why, I just do!</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: You do! You definitely do.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Just come to the Mudd Club on Friday.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I don’t go there. Too many party girls.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Party girls? Can I call you?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Yeah, if you have any dimes left.
477-0496.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Here, this is for you. I made this.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hey, mom.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I met the girl I’m gonna marry.</p>
<p><strong>matilde</strong>: Do you like it here?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’d like it better in Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: “She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She
loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!” Bring me some chicken, baby!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I’m
doing?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah man. I’m jealous. You’re always
great, Benny. “Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me.” I did say
chicken!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I knew I left these somewhere. One of
these’ll send your kids to college someday. Here - I made this for
you.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Thanks. Your dad called again - something
about a job.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: You got a date already?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: We’re getting married. She said she could
tell I was a great artist - she could see it in my eyes. She said she
wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: G’night… See you in court tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bum</strong>: The guy just hit me and I was on the ground!!!!
Boom, for real.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I-Is this the s-s-suicide h-h-hotline?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes. My name is Chris. What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Jean Michel.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: That’s a beautiful name. French?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Haitian. I’m going to kill myself. I’m
taking pills. Reds, blues, greens.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What? Wait a minute… talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Life doesn’t… make… sense. This city’s
k-killing me. I want my liquid hijack Marlboros!</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What? Life’s beautiful. Depression isn’t
permanent. Don’t you believe that? What is it - did your girlfriend
leave you?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: No! I have a boyfriend. He loves me.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: You see? You have someone to live for.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: No, I don’t. I’m alone. We all are.
Especially here. The world’s unjust. The respect fools get. The
disrespect I get.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What is it you want? Respect? I have respect
for you, just for making this call. One philosopher said “Sadness is a
sin against the richness of the world.” Think about it. Feel it.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You don’t even know me. I want real
respect.</p>
<p><strong>chris</strong>: What? What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Fame. My liquid hijack Marlboros and the
moon and the cow that jumped over it.</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: One philosopher said “Give me my liquid hijack
Marlboros. Life’s beautiful. You have someone to live for. What do you
want? RKKKK! That’s a beautiful name… French?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Boom, for real.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I thought you hated this place?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I do. I just said that. I was never here
before. I actually like it.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Miss Cardinale… Open up for me,
please!</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Ohhh, Dios mio!</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: I just want the rent.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Why didn’t you say so? Damn! She’s
asleep!</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Next Monday.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Wanna go get some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: A friend of mine offered me a job doing a
little work installing a show in a gallery. He’s an electrician. I was
supposed to be there an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Ohh, that’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Jean, could you get me a Phillips
screwdriver?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: A Phillips head. From the toolbox.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: ‘Phillips head,’ right?</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You don’t have any!!!</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: That’s impossible. I’ve got, like, five of
’em!</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: You’re holding one in your hand!!! You’ve
never done this kind of work before, have you? See, this is a regular
screwdriver, and this is a Phillips head. The cross thing… I’ll tell you
later what all the tools are so you’ll know.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I need to make a call, Mary. You don’t mind,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: Certainly not. You can use my line.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: To Paris. Bernard Picasso - You know Bernard
-</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: Jean? Hold this, please. You’ll get there. But
it’s good to have something to fall back on. That’s why I became an
electrician. It pays the rent. Y’know, I’m an artist, too.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>greg</strong>: I sculpt. I’m really just starting to find
myself. How old are you? Twenty? You’re just like I used to be. I’m
forty-one. And I’m glad I haven’t gotten any recognition. It gave me
time to develop.</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: I can’t tell you how happy I am with
this show.</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: Excuse me - you - what’s your name?
Would you move those tools there and put them somewhere else?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: My name is Jean Michel Basquiat. Have you
heard of me?</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: No. Should I have?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’m a painter, too.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: Really. Huh. Too bad.</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: Excuse me, would you please move those
tools?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A wall. We see the following graffity:</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette.
Concentrate.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I am… On Gina. Fuck - I didn’t think we
were actually gonna do this.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Concentrate on the ball. Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: You’re shattering all my myths.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Your people.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Oh - you mean black people!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: How long do you think it takes to get
really famous?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: For a musician or a painter?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your
stuff all day without thinking about anything else.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Ummm… Four years. Six to get rich.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: First, you have to dress right.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Then, you have to hang out all the time -
with famous people - the right people, the right chicks, the right
parties.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: And you gotta do your work all the time when
you’re not doing that. The same kinda work, the same style - over and
over again, so people recognize it and don’t get confused. Then, once
you’re famous, you have to keep doing it the same way, even after it’s
boring - unless you want people to really get mad at you - which they
will anyway.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Come on. I hate this. I’m no good at
it.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Famous people are usually pretty stupid.
You’re too smart. You’d get bored to death. You don’t wanna be like John
Henry - fighting the machine. Just do what you do. It’s about integrity.
Follow your heart.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Who’s John Henry?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Oh man! Folklore guy - worked on the
railroad. Y’know, pounding in spikes and laying down track. Then one day
they invented a machine to do it. And he says “Fuck that, I’m a MAN” and
he challenges the machine to a race to lay down a mile of track. It
takes two days. Neck and neck the whole time. They get right to the end,
and he beats it by one spike.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: So then what?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: He drops dead! See? Just do your shit like
you do it! Your friends like you, you get laid, everyone walks by, sees
your stuff everywhere. It’s good. What else do you want?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Like I said - my liquid hijack Marlboros.
Check it out.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Andy Warhol. He’s famous and he’s not
boring.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: What’re you doing? You’re doing
something.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: He’s the best painter in the world. I’m
gonna give him one of these.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Don’t give him anything, man. Your art’s
worth a lot. Trade. That’s what real artists do with each other.
Besides, he’ll just use you. He’s famous for that.</p>
<p><strong>maitre’d</strong>: Can I help you?.</p>
<p><strong>maitre’d</strong>: Sir…?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I think it’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>maitre’d</strong>: Of course, Mr. Bischofberger.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten
bucks.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Ignorant art?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah… Like - stupid, ridiculous, crummy
art.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Ohhh. That’s new. That sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Ten bucks apiece.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: I can give you five. You didn’t do very
much to these.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You don’t even work on your stuff!</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: It doesn’t matter how much you worked on</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I can get ten.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: I’ll take two. This one and… that one.
Can I borrow some money, Bruno?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Here. Do you have change?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You made a good deal. Here, you can have
these, too.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Check you later, man.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Hi Gina.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: … ‘APT 20’… The church bells would ring at
noon and six a.m.. 24 strokes: How many times we counted them. We called
our bed the cloud. And there we’d float. The bathtub was in the kitchen
and took forever to fill up. We’d bathe together afterwards. Oh the
countless cigarettes and take out Chinese food… The bed was so narrow
Three years we made it fit. The sheets were green the sheets were pink
the sheets white linen from the past. Little home, farewell, The broken
windows and the bodega on the corner. Now from my balcony I look out
over all New York…</p>
<p><strong>series of dissolves</strong>: As they’re turning together in
their sleep.</p>
<p><strong>series of dissolves</strong>: Paintings and objects fill the
room.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What
are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: C’mon, baby, I painted them for you.
They’re beautiful now.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I’m going to my parents this weekend. What am
I going to wear? How could you do that to me?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: … I’ll buy you some new ones.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Do you know what he’s saying?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: What who’s saying?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Manzanita…. … if one day I die, and you
read this piece of paper, I want you to know how much I love you.
Although I’ll never see you again, Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair,
your face, your face’</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: ‘Even though you were never mine And you
never will be You have a piece of my heart You have, you have, you
have…’ ‘Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face.’</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Willie Mays!!! Willie Mays!!!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Come on in!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Gina, don’t you want any of this? You
could use some.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>guy #1</strong>: Nice underwear…</p>
<p><strong>camera pulls back</strong>: Revealing Jean’s eyes. They’re
open and motionless. His head is tilted toward his chest.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Basquiat?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Wake up! I’m back!</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Jean, what did you do to yourself?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Don’t do this to me.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: … What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of
me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You’re back.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: It’s Monday morning.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: It’s not Sunday? I missed you. You
shouldn’t leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: You’re blaming me? I had to go see my
family.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’m your family.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Basquiat, what did you take?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Nothing special - just some weed.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Basquiat, don’t lie. This is smack.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You want some?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: We got beat.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: For real?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: You gonna carry that around all night?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah… I’ll paint on it.</p>
<p><strong>rockets</strong>: You did that, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here
for awhile.</p>
<p><strong>rockets</strong>: Do one for me and it’s free. How’s
that?</p>
<p><strong>artist #1</strong>: Check this out, Rene.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: “The name of the game is survival, You learn
it in jail upon your arrival!”</p>
<p><strong>artist #2</strong>: Chill, man! Be cool! This isn’t even my

<p><strong>rene</strong>: Oh man, you a FINE nigga! You know that?</p>
<p><strong>artist #2</strong>: Cut it out, man! And don’t be callin’ me

<p><strong>artist #1</strong>: Rene! Come here, man!</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I gotta go pee.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Who did this? Who did this?</p>
<p><strong>artist #2</strong>: I don’t know. I told you, this isn’t my
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>artist #3</strong>: I know who did that. That’s Jean
Michel’s. He’s right here, man…</p>
<p><strong>artist #3</strong>: Fuck, man, where’d he go? Where’s
Jean?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: It’s fucking amazing. Motherfucker’s got to
put a crown on it.</p>
<p><strong>artist #1</strong>: Rene, man, check this out. Whoa… He’s
kinda cute.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.</p>
<p><strong>artist #2</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Just look at him.</p>
<p><strong>artist #3</strong>: Whoa - check it out. It’s him!</p>
<p><strong>artist #2</strong>: That’s the same guy who did this

<p><strong>rene</strong>: I know that. Don’t let him get away.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Hey, wait up!!!</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: You heard of Albert Milo. I made that niggah.
I’m Rene Ricard. Didn’t you read “Not About Albert Milo?” I know who to
hype. Baby, I’m gonna make you a star.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Can you put me in the ring with him?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I can put you in the ring with him. Even book
the dates. But those big boys know how to fight. They</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Jean Michel Basquiat.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Sounds famous already.</p>
<p><strong>insert</strong>: A huge poster reads:</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Oh child… You got no respect. Didn’t anyone
teach you how to mount paintings?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: This is a very important season in New York.
One’s public appearance is absolute. Oh!!! Louise!!! I’d like you to
meet Jean Michel Basquiat - SAMO. This is Henry Geldzahler.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Ohh… SAMO. I’ve heard a lot about you. I love
your graffiti.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I was a kid then.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: How much are these?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: You or the museum?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: It’s for me.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Five.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: That’s five thousand dollars. He’s from the
Metropolitan Museum of Art so suck my pussy, you star.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You look fucking beautiful, beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Well thanks!</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: This is Jean Michel, whose work I told you
about.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: Rene hasn’t stopped talking about your
paintings. Haven’t I seen you in my gallery?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: You haven’t been by lately.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I didn’t have the subway fare. My Medicare ran
out.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You’re doing well.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: I’d love to see some more of your
work… Where’s your studio?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You name it, I paint there.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: Well, I don’t want to get mugged on a
Bowery street corner. Maybe I could find a place for you to work. Take
my card.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: No thanks. But I’d like one of these
paintings.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: You kidding? That’s Annina Nosei. Jean’s been
in her gallery a thousand times. You slut. How do you know Bruno
Bischofberger? He’s only the biggest art dealer in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I had lunch with him once.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Which island of Hawaii do you want our
house to be on? Maui? Kaui? Molokai?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I hadn’t thought about it.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Oahu, Lanai, Niihau, Kahoolawee -</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Staten Island would be ok.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Do you wanna marry me?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Kind of a family portrait.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: It looks done.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Think so?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: … babies.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: You mean babies with you?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What’s wrong with me?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: You’re your own baby.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: Annina Nosei.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Hello? Oh. Come in.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: Is Jean Michel here?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: I’m here to see some work.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: These are great.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: How much for these five?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: You should talk to him about this.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: Um… Do Rene and Jean have a contract
together?</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: I’m interested in showing Jean’s
work.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I really think you should talk to him about
this.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: How about right now?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Be ready in a minute!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Honk the horn again, will you please?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: What’s the rush, John Henry?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I ain’t John Henry.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What’s your fuckin’ problem, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: I don’t really have any problems.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Good. What do you have?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: What’s your fuckin’ problem? You get a
girlfriend and a little attention and then start acting all uppity with
me.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: ‘Uppity?’ Like as in ‘uppity nigger?’</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: That’s not how I meant it. For all you know,
you might just be a flash in the pan! You can never tell.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hey fuck you! I deserve this shit. You’re
just jealous ’cause it ain’t happening to you!</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: I’ve got to find the switch.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: Here it is.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: 3rd night I called him ‘boy’ He sed “don’t
call me ‘boy’” “Well Then don’t call me ‘Boss’” That Was the end for us
and I’ve Been seeing him for 2 1/2 years. In kangaroo court I want to
be</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Oh man! That’s one looks famous already.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: You are a willful boy. How’m I s’posed to
write about you if you keep changing everything?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Uh huhh… Band practice? It’s Benny. He wants
to know why you’re not at band practice…?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Fuck… I forgot about that.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Fuck band practice… If you’re gonna be a
painter you’re gonna have to break a few hearts - you don’t wanna be
like Tony Bennett..</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Tony Bennett… What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Singing on stage and painting in your
spare</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I didn’t know Tony Bennett painted.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: My point exactly.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: So keep painting.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yes, Boss. If you’re so smart, why are you
here with me in this basement?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: You’re news. I want the scoop. I write it
down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people
know it’s true. There’s never been a black painter in art history that’s
been considered really important, you know?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: So shut up and keep painting..</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: 5:11.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: That one’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Thanks… I’ll take it tonight.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I can’t. After the show.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hey - it’s the big A.M..</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: Rene’s been telling me about your
work.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: Is this finished yet?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: When’s your show?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Not sure. How was yours?</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: I haven’t decided yet. Rene, you wanna
come over to the studio tomorrow. I wanna make a painting of you.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: How about now?</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: See you at your opening. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Ohhh, Albert Milo, what a pleasure to
meet you.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: This is Rene Ricard.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: We’re Tom and Cynthia Kruger - nice
to have met you.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: Tom and Cynthia Kruger.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: This is Jean Michel Basquiat. You’ve
seen the SAMO graffiti everywhere. That’s his. This is the true voice of
the gutter.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia kruger</strong>: We’ve seen the graffiti. I work on
Wall Street. And I’ve heard wonderful things about the paintings.
Everybody’s talking about you.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: Here’s a very good example of his
recent work that’s not spoken for yet. He’s got to work in a basement.
He’s got so much energy that if he worked in a place with a window, he’d
jump right through it. Most of these are reserved already. After this
week, this work will not be available.</p>
<p><strong>tom kruger</strong>: … I don’t know…. This one’s nice, but I
don’t know if I could live with it. That green is so… institutional.</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: Yo, man, you’re a damn lucky nigger selling
this shit!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: Not bad. Yeah, I do.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia kruger</strong>: I’m fascinated by his choice of
crossing out words that way.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: Yes, well, they are more meaningful in
their absence, no?</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>cynthia kruger</strong>: I like this one, but that green…</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Y’want me to make it a nice shit
brown?</p>
<p><strong>tom kruger</strong>: Beg pardon?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hi. This is Gina.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia kruger</strong>: They’re something like Dubuffet’s…
That… childlike quality.</p>
<p><strong>tom kruger</strong>: I like this one. If it were just another
color..</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Get a fucking decorator. If you buy one,
you’ll have to change your whole lives - maybe even sell your kids!
These paintings aren’t even done yet!!!</p>
<p><strong>tom kruger</strong>: I think we’ll take the green one.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’ll take three big Macs, two chocolate
shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.</p>
<p><strong>counterman</strong>: You want three Big Macs, two chocolate
shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Forget it .I’ll take six, no, seven
chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies.</p>
<p><strong>counterman</strong>: You only want one Big Mac?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah… And make it three apple pies.</p>
<p><strong>big pink</strong>: How can I ever thank you?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’d like to squeeze your titties.</p>
<p><strong>big pink</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Wanna Mac?</p>
<p><strong>big pink</strong>: No, I’d like the scarf.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Have a Mac.</p>
<p><strong>big pink</strong>: I don’t eat junk food.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Oh. I didn’t know. I’ll take you to the
best restaurant in town. You’ll miss a great meal and I’ll keep the
scarf, anyway. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>big pink</strong>: You’re a fast mover.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: No name? That’s ok. I’ll just call you Big
Pink.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: A present I picked up for you.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: It’s beautiful. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You look like an angel.</p>
<p><strong>voices in crowd</strong>: Jean!!! Jean Michel!!!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Jean, man!!! Let’s make a record!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You finally did it.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: He’s so fulla shit.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: How much is he getting for these?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Andy, man, thanks for coming. I’d like to
paint your jacket.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: My jacket? Gee, great… Your show looks
great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine
with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your
gallery? First time I’ve heard of that!</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She’s
got the great new gallery.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah, I met her already.</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: You should be pleased. It’s a great
show…I’m having a dinner later at Mr. Chow’s for Albert. You should
come.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: You’ll like it. Everyone’ll be
there.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: Jean, your parents are here.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hi Dad. Hi Nora.</p>
<p><strong>nora</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Thanks for coming.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: You must be very proud.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I am!</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: How does it feel to have a genius in the
family?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: It feels… good!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>tom kruger</strong>: We love our painting.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Which painting?</p>
<p><strong>tom kruger</strong>: The green one.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cynthia kruger</strong>: We got a couch to match.</p>
<p><strong>tom kruger</strong>: She’s only kidding!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Willie Mays. A Toast.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Not now, ok?</p>
<p><strong>rockets</strong>: Jean Michel, my man. Nice party. Should we
step into my office?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: That’s alright. I’m cool now.</p>
<p><strong>rockets</strong>: A gift! I was just trying to give you a
gift!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Of the painters, please.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: He said ‘of the painters!’ Hey - Albert!
Get in the picture!</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: Hey, Jean, I’d like you to meet my
wife….and my parents. Mom, Dad, this is Jean Michel Basquiat.</p>
<p><strong>esther milo</strong>: Don’t do that. Hello, Jean.</p>
<p><strong>jack milo</strong>: Hi, John… Are your parents here?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Well. My dad’s here with his wife. My mom
couldn’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>esther milo</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I’d like to do a show with you. I’m
especially interested in that one. I’d like to buy it for myself.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I wasn’t gonna sell this one.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You shouldn’t have put it in the show. This
is the one I absolutely have to have. I really love it.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Sure, ok..</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Do you think I could borrow your
limousine? I’ll get it back to you in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: It’s OK. Just have him bring you to dinner at
Mr. Chow’s later. We’ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Bye, Jean.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: You fucking little whore! You sold my
painting! I’m gonna tell you something, brother - when you’re climbing
up the ladder of success, don’t kick out the rungs! Believe that
shit.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’ll make you another one.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Rene -</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: SHHHHHH. Later. “What is it about art,
anyway……”</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: … that we give it so much importance? Artists
are respected by the poor because what they do is an honest way to get
out of the slum using one’s sheer self as the medium. The money earned
is proof pure and simple of the value of that individual… The
Artist.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: The picture a mother’s son does in jail hangs
on her wall as proof that beauty is possible even in the most wretched.
And this is a much different idea than the fancier notion that art is a
scam and a rip-off. But you could never explain to someone who uses
God’s gift to enslave that you have used God’s gift to be free.”</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I really… admire you.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Me? Why?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Would you check out my studio some time?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Sure. I’d be glad to.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What’s your name, man?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: They call me Steve, but I prefer Shenge.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Nice to meet you, Shenge. Want a job?</p>
<p><strong>maitre’d</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Hi, Jean.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Jean, everyone loved your show.</p>
<p><strong>jack milo</strong>: Nixon lives in Saddle River, New
York.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Saddle River’s in New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>jack milo</strong>: Saddle River, New York!</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: It’s in New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>jack milo</strong>: New York.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: I think it’s in New Jersey.</p>
<p><strong>jack milo</strong>: It’s in New York.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Oh, I didn’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Jean smiles at Andy’s diplomacy.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: You finish it.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Bring him over sometime. I have some other
stuff to show him.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: Go on, take it..</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I’d like a glass of your best champagne,
please? This is an enormously important season in New York, and to make
a false step could have severe repercussions for years. We are no longer
collecting art, we’re buying individuals.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Oh shut up, Rene.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Everything’s over your head, Andy. Even
Mr. Chow’s menu. Thanks for not inviting me</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I’m starving. You can’t buy advertising like
this. This is the most glamorous dinner you’ll have here this fall. How
about some of that imitation crab?</p>
<p><strong>mr. chow</strong>: I’m not paying for the drawing with crab.
It’s a present to my friends. It’s my birthday.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Isn’t he great? Thanks, Jean.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: He owes me one.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chow</strong>: You’re too much, Rene. Get this guy out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: I haven’t eaten yet!!!</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Hands off me, you faggots! I’m going. I’m
going…I’ve kept Diana Vreeland waiting too long, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Wow… That was a nice drawing, too,
Jean. Maybe you should do another one.</p>
<p><strong>mr. chow</strong>: Some other time.</p>
<p><strong>annina nosei</strong>: It’s great that people are interested,
but if anyone’s going to buy anything, I’ll handle it for you.
Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your
studio.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: … had twenty-three one man shows, been
in forty three group shows from Zurich to Tokyo..</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: … had over fifty articles written about
you, switched galleries - how many times? - DJ’d in the hottest clubs
-</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: … one of the youngest artists ever to
be included in the Whitney Biennial, also produced a rap record. It’s
said you’re quite the ladies man - even dated Madonna for a couple
months!!! All at the ripe old age of 24. One might ask: is there
anything left for Jean Michel Basquiat to do?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: What is it that gets you out of bed in
the morning?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I hate this. Turn that off.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: We’re running a little late.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: … Can you… decipher this for us?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Decipher?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Yes. What do they… stand for?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: They’re just words.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Yes, I understand - but where do you
take them from?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Where? Do you ask Miles where he got that
note from? Where do you take your words from? Everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: What are they?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Leeches. A long list of leeches. It looks
good like that.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Hmmm. And ‘Parasites.’ You seem to be a
Primal Expressionist.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You mean like an ape?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: A primate?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Well, you said that. You’ve got a lot
of references from Leonardo da Vinci, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Oh, that’s a “Leonardo’s Greatest Hits”
painting. You like it?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Yes, but as a black painter -</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I use a lot of colors - not only
black.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’m not black.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: You’re not?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Not what?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Not black.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: No, I’m Haitian-Puerto Rican.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Yes, yes… Let’s talk about that…. your
roots… Your father is from Haiti, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Hmmmm. Interesting. And when you grew
up were there any primitives hanging in your home?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: We don’t hang them at home, y’know - just
in the streets..</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: I see.. And… How do you respond to
being called - hmmm… - yes, “the pickaninny of the art world.”</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Who said that?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Why, that’s from Time Magazine.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: No, he said I was the Eddie Murphy of the
art world. He said the Eddie Murphy.</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Is it true that your mother resides in
a mental institution?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Let me… just… open something up here.
You come from a nice, middle class, respectable home. Your father is an
accountant. Why did you at one time live in a cardboard box in Tompkins
Square?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Or rather, do you think you’re being
exploited or are you yourself exploiting the white image of the black
artist from the ghetto?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Are those the only two possibilities? You
wanna French fry?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: OK. One last thing. Is there any anger
in you? Any anger in your work?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Should there be?</p>
<p><strong>interviewer</strong>: Tell me about it. What are you angry
about?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Mmmm. I don’t know. I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Can I have some caviar, please?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’d like to taste it, first.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Is that the best quality you have?</p>
<p><strong>counterman</strong>: Yeah, it’s the best one.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’ll take the whole tin.</p>
<p><strong>counterman</strong>: It’s three thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’ll take it. Andy, gimme three thousand
dollars. Just the caviar - I’ll get the rest.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You check everyone’s bills or just
mine?</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: When I was little, my brother and I
used to have two ducks as pets. We called them the Rodriguez
Brothers.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I wish they’d quit writing this shit about
me.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: That’s good. At least they’re
interested.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Everybody’s paying top dollar for scraps
of paper, refrigerator doors - anything with a SAMO tag on it. The other
day, I just wanted a pack of cigarettes, so I did a drawing and sold it
for two bucks. A week later this gallery calls me up: “Somebody’s
offering us the drawing. Should we buy it for five thousand?”</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Wow… Stop giving them away. I got an
invitation to model for Comme de Garcons… You wanna do it with me?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah - I’d do that… You could teach
me.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Gee. I don’t need to. You’re a natural.
You should sign up with my modeling agent.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: My dog, Archie… I woke up with flea
bites… Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really
well.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Let’s leave this town and go
someplace.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Let’s go to the Carnegie Museum. They
have the world’s most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster
replicas. It’s really great. It’s in Pittsburg.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Ouch..</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: That girl looks just like my old
girlfriend Gina.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Do you still love her?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah. I really blew it. I still think
about her.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Well, have you asked her to come
back?</p>
<p><strong>maitre’d</strong>: Mr. Basquiat - what a pleasure to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hey George, what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: So are you really friends with Andy? He seems
like such a weirdo.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: He’s not. He’s out of town and he calls me
every day. What’s weird about him?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Don’t you think he’s using you?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Why does everybody say that? He’s the only
person I know who doesn’t need to use me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Would you like to see the wine list?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Chateau Latour ’64, please.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall.
Of course, there’s like, a year of pre-med stuff, but - whatever. I’m
really excited. And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are
getting published.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: How is he?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: Pretty much the same.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Wow. Congratulations. I hate that asshole.
Thanks for coming. I guess I just wanted to find out how you’re -</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: What’s that about?</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: That is amazing. What year is it?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m sorry, Mr. Basquiat.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: See that table over there? I’d like to pay
their bill.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah, just put their bill on my tab.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Baby, I think about you a lot. I’m really
sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I’m serious. I wish,
y’know, that we were -</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: I don’t believe it, Jean - they’re picking
straws.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I wish you niggahs could get it togeth-
ahhhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>young executive</strong>: What’s this for?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: The tip.</p>
<p><strong>gina</strong>: You don’t have to be sorry. There’s no one to
blame. Jean, you’re a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me
realize I wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: It’s always how you would do it. This is
my version.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: You’re right. It’s your version. You
should come over to the studio sometime.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Why, so you could humiliate me?</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: No, I wanted to make a painting of
you.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: A little more to the right, Frank. OK…
Good. Now up… You got a little more?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What’s with the wigs?</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: I’m going to send them to my friends
for Christmas presents.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: You think those are good presents? Who
wants an old wig?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Piss painting?</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: I wanted to make a few more of these.
Frank’s been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: How come you’re not peeing on them
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: I don’t like beer.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: If you ever want me to shit on ’em, just
ask. You could finger paint.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: That was my favorite part!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: We can do better. It needed more
white.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Jean, you make me feel worthless.
You’re so famous.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I don’t even have any friends anymore
besides you. And everyone says “Warhol?</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Gee. You shouldn’t take it so
seriously, Jean. That’s why you can’t stop taking drugs. You always
think people don’t like you. Everyone likes you.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: People are only interested in you because
you’re famous, not because they know a fuckin’ thing about your
work.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Bruno called. In Europe, people are
saying you’re gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your
death.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: When I was poor, everybody doubted I could
make it. When I got rich, everyone said,
<code>yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says</code>he’s
killing himself.’ So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art’s
dead.’ I don’t take drugs, anyway. I’m healthy now.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: If you say so. You sleep until 5:00
p.m. You call at four in the morning. You never show up anywhere on time
- if you show up. You’re painting out everything I do!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: That’s better.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: I can’t even see what’s good
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: Yeah, I see what you mean about the
white. It’s better.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: After the show we should take a nice long
vacation. Maybe go to Hawaii. That’s what</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: That would be a pity because you’re a
real painter.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Here’s the poster for the show.</p>
<p><strong>close up</strong>: Andy in mirror wearing helmet.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>brunette</strong>: Elke.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Number?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Monica.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Number?</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: 477-0258.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yo, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is really great. What a nice place.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Have you met Christine?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Would you sign one of those for me?</p>
<p><strong>toxic</strong>: YO! Jean, this is Ramellzee.</p>
<p><strong>rammellzee</strong>: Yo… You know why Rammellzee’s here,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>toxic</strong>: Uh-oh!</p>
<p><strong>rammellzee</strong>: I’m here for an interrogation. You’ve
been called a graffiti artist and I wanna know why. All I see are
scribble scrabble abstractions!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Boom.</p>
<p><strong>rammellzee</strong>: Boom? As in ordnance? Are your
letters</p>
<p><strong>toxic</strong>: Man, I was up on him years ago on the
IRT.</p>
<p><strong>rammellzee</strong>: You’re selling and ending the culture.
Not one bit of information. Only to get the money and growl with the
power, man.</p>
<p><strong>toxic</strong>: That’s ignorant.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: That ain’t ignorant - that’s just stupid.
Can I get you a bowl of gumbo?</p>
<p><strong>rammellzee</strong>: This interrogation is not over!</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Albert Milo? Ugh! He’s just a pressmonger.
That’s all these people do.</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: You know, I love Jean’s early work. It’s
really got something. But this collaboration with Andy - maybe they
thought it was a joke… I mean - whose work is it? Jean’s or Andy’s?</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: His early work? He’s only twenty-six!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hey, Rene.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: Thanks again for not inviting me. I’m only
here on business.</p>
<p><strong>rene</strong>: You’re asking me? Nigga, please. After the way
you treated me? This is the first time I’ve heard from either of you in
months! I had to crash this party! You treated me like a suede biscuit.
Rene don’t play that! I can’t get him off drugs! I don’t even talk to
him any more!!!</p>
<p><strong>andy warhol</strong>: What’s a suede biscuit?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hey, what’s this? It says right here
you’re Andy’s… “lapdog”…</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Here… Pull over.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: Mind your own fuckin’ business.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: That’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: That ain’t yours, man. Some asshole named SAMO
did this.</p>
<p><strong>kid#3</strong>: He’s dead. That’s what I heard.</p>
<p><strong>kid #2</strong>: He ain’t dead yet. He’s gonna kill himself.
That’s why all those art fags in Soho are paying more every time we
bring one of these in.</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: Stupid SAMO… Hardly any of this shit
left.</p>
<p><strong>kid #3</strong>: This one’s damn nice. I say we hang onto it
if he’s almost dead.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: There you go. Now it’s worth more.</p>
<p><strong>kid #2</strong>: What’s he saying?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’m SAMO… I’m SAMO…</p>
<p><strong>kid #3</strong>: He says he’s SAMO.</p>
<p><strong>kid #1</strong>: He wish.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Paint it out.</p>
<p><strong>shenge</strong>: Out?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah… Maybe just his arms.</p>
<p><strong>shenge</strong>: It’s Andy again.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Still not here.</p>
<p><strong>shenge</strong>: - In this corner?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Yeah..</p>
<p><strong>shenge</strong>: You want me to put it here?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Use your fucking instinct.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Don’t try to make art. Just paint like a
housepainter.</p>
<p><strong>shenge</strong>: It’s Maria Portos. What should we do?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Why don’t you try letting her in, Steve -
I mean Shenge.</p>
<p><strong>shenge</strong>: Get up. She won’t buy anything if she sees
me working on it!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Wanna bet? If you show too much respect
for people with money, they don’t have respect for you.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: These reminded me of you, the clogs. I found
them in Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You remember Ellen? What are you working
on?</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: How much is something like that?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Fifteen. Reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: It’s unfinished. How ’bout some blue in
the corner?</p>
<p><strong>shenge</strong>: Blue? Where?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What’s wrong with you today?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Don’t look at me like that. It hurts my
feelings.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I love these.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Who are you selling these through now?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Well, that’s better. You can buy direct
from me.</p>
<p><strong>ellen</strong>: Look at these - silkscreens? What’re you?
Andy Warhol Junior? It’s like - not even handmade anymore.</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: Jean Michel… Crawling from the
wreckage?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I need a dealer.</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: You have a bunch of them, don’t you?
Albert Milo walks in from another room.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: Hey Jean! It’ll never fit.</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: It’ll be ok.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: You better take a look. Why’s your door
so small? The ceilings are sixteen feet and your door’s the size of a
mouse hole!</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: You doing anything right now?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Naa..</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: See ya in an hour. So what do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk
about it.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>mary boone</strong>: OK. I’ll be at your studio Thursday
three o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: This is painted on a backdrop from the
Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth
painting. I felt like he could’ve painted it, or maybe someone else was
painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change
their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else..</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Do you ever get sick of it?</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: The whole thing - painting.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: No. It’s one of the few times I feel
good. I used to have to go to work and cook every</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What about the shit they write?</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: You’re asking me this because of the
‘lapdog’ remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the
compassion of a housefly. That’s your enemy, not your audience. Your
audience hasn’t even been born yet. It’s a lie that art is popular. The
only thing popular about it is that it’s written about in newspapers.
I’m surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There’re about ten
people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy’s one of
them.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I haven’t felt like talking to him since
that thing came out.</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: As long as I’ve known Andy, he’s never
asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs.
He’s painted my picture, we’ve eaten dinner in God knows how many places
together. But he doesn’t care about me. He cares about you. You’re the
only person he cares about. He’s your friend. Fuck that article. You
want a toasted bagel with cream cheese?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Papa, the TV’s broken… Will you fix it
please?</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: Alright. I’ll be right up.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: I’ve seen you before. I like your paintings
a lot. Your hair was different.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Some of them.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Stand still.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: Thanks</p>
<p><strong>albert milo</strong>: Where’s Jean?</p>
<p><strong>stella</strong>: He just left.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: B.B. It’s me - Jean! What’s the matter? No
snow in Switzerland this year?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You haven’t heard? Andy’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>music up</strong>: Tom Waits’ “Tom Traubert’s Blues”</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hello? Gina?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hey, come here! Please. Just for a second.
Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Open up! Open up!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: My mother’s inside.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Come back tomorrow. Visiting hours are over.
Don’t cause any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I’m not here to visit… I wanna take her
home.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Don’t cause any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Willie Mays.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Benny’s face.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Willie Mays… Nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: How’s Gina? You guys getting along?</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: She’s good.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: I guess it was a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Come on, let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Sit down! You’re gonna fall out!</p>
<p><strong>benny</strong>: Drugs??!</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Medicine, man! Like health food. I’m
taking care of my health!</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: You starting a hospital?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Just ring it up. I don’t need a bag. Try
this tabouli - it’s great…</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: My mom told me this… Or was it a
dream?</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: There was this little prince with a magic
crown. An evil warlock kidnapped him, locked him in a cell in a huge
tower and took away his voice. There was a window made of bars. The
prince would smash his head against the bars hoping that someone would
hear the sound and find him. The crown made the most beautiful sound
that anyone ever heard. You could hear the ringing for miles. It was so
beautiful, that people wanted to grab the air. They never found the
prince. He never got out of the room. But the sound he made filled
everything up with beauty.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: It’s definitely time to get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>basquiat</strong>: Hawaii? Fuck Hawaii. Let’s go to Ireland.
We’ll stop in every bar and have a drink.</p>
