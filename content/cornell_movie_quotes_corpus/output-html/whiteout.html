<p><strong>closer</strong>: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged
peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist’ of wind-blown
snow whips about this jumble of glinting ice.</p>
<p><strong>still closer</strong>: We track down through valleys, skirt
crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat stretch of ice. HOLD
on this scene of timeless, savage beauty, then…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein needs to see
you in biology. Said it’s urgent.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Alright –</p>
<p>****: Hey Fred, unlock any secrets of the Universe – discover we’re
Alien life forms?</p>
<p><strong>fred</strong>: Workin’ on it.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Which one’s Sapperstein?</p>
<p><strong>scientist</strong>: Deschampsia Antarctica.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sapperstein</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>sapperstein</strong>: – Follow me.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: All what?</p>
<p><strong>sapperstein</strong>: Cannabis Sativa.</p>
<p>****: It was just budding, too.</p>
<p>****: It’s not funny!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Professor Sapperstein, I’d like you to read
something for me.</p>
<p><strong>sapperstein</strong>: Carrie Stetko.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Keep reading.</p>
<p><strong>sapperstein</strong>: United States Marshal.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p>****: Now are you still sure you want to report the theft of an
illegal narcotic?</p>
<p><strong>sapperstein</strong>: Not this year, no.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Good. And how are you feeling right now?</p>
<p><strong>sapperstein</strong>: You think I’m crazy? Is that what
you’re saying?</p>
<p>****: No, no, not crazy. But this time of year, down here, we’re all
going a little toasty aren’t we? How about you plant a little Cannabis
when you get home?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: You busy?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p>****: I know you weren’t in the area. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I got a pilot at ASB who thinks he spotted a
popsicle out on the ice.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What flavor?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: And we were doing so well.</p>
<p>****: Where?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: McClain Valley.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: McClain Valley? What was he doing out there?
That’s no man’s land.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I’ve got a plane heading to ASB in an hour
with some supplies for Winter-over.</p>
<p>****: Can’t get you back until tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No – just the picture.</p>
<p><strong>super title</strong>: South Pole / Amundsen-Scott Station</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: opulation: 183 Temperature: - 55�</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Bottom of the frickin’ planet.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Doc?</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Well, hello Marshal.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Keller.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Out back. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Checking the freezer for a popsicle.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: No shit?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: It got called in this morning.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Who spotted it?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Delfy, one of the pilots here.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: It’s his first year down here. You know how
that goes. My bet it was just debris, an old tent or something.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah – probably.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Here’s an idea – why don’t you stay here
with me and we’ll party, just the two of us. Put those cuffs of yours to
work.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …Were you the second guy from the front?</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Not interested.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: I’ll have them boomerang back and pick up
the load – just have it ready.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: Guys got the science lab all shut down.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Good, have them check all the pressure
levels on the hydraulics, then clear the exterior storage bins. Make
sure we’re not leaving anything out there.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Sam told me you’d be coming up – how’s the
sleigh ride?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Fine. I need a plane and that pilot who saw
the popsicle.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: I’ll have him meet you in the hangar.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah, good.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: In less than three days we begin Winter-over.
The sky will go completely black and stay that way for six months.</p>
<p><strong>asian</strong>: T… T… Three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Your core body temperatures have fallen to
approximately 97 degrees. You are shivering uncontrollably – losing
basic motor skills. You’re having trouble focusing on even the simplest
tasks. In short, you are well on your way to dying, and it has only been
two-hundred seconds.</p>
<p>****: Put your coats on.</p>
<p><strong>class</strong>: Hello Marshal Stetko.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Always a pleasure to see you. Unlike most of
the beaker-heads down here.</p>
<p>****: Social visit?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I wish – We got a job. I need you to take a
ride with me.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CARRIE</p>
<p>****: Might be a body out on the ice.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why’s this crap always happen at the end of the
season?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: So it is.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What’s your gut say about this body?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: My gut and I don’t talk anymore.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: People change, Carrie.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Not you.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I got a card from my Granddaughter inviting me
to her fifth birthday party. You know, I’ve never even met her.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Or mentioned her. A grandchild? Doc, that’s
great.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It got me thinking – I need to be a better
Grandfather, than I was a father. It’s time I deal with my life. I’ve
been down here a lot longer than I probably should have.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You Delfy?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Where the hell they get these
thumb-suckers?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Brooklyn. And unless your wrinkled ass has a
heart attack on my plane, I think we’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: – I want Keller. He’s my pilot.</p>
<p>****: Keller, get over here!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Delfy’s taking us, Doc. He’s the one who saw
the body. C’mon, you’ll be fine. I’ll even hold your hand if you
want.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What were you doing out there?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: I went to evac a camp. Had to fly off route
to get around a storm. Got down low to avoid some turbulence, and there
it was.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: That your son?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Yeah, name’s Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: He’s cute. Has your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Lucky he got his momma’s brain. Kid’s
smart.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: So why aren’t you with him?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: The bonus pay. Trying to buy a house. Give my
boy a yard. His own room. Stuff I never had.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Hate it.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Then why are you down here?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: We all make stupid mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: It’s right up here.</p>
<p>****: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah. Got it. It’s a popsicle alright.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: … It’s always different when they freeze. Some
curl up. Some stretch out. Some tear their clothes off. They get
delirious. What was that guy’s name?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Linger.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah. He’s lost in a storm. We can’t find him,
but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the Serengeti heat
and his wife, Janet. Next day, we find him frozen solid, wearing nothing
but his bunny boots.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Never seen a dead guy?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: So do you. Think his name’s Weiss. We
Wintered-over last year with him. Played cards a couple of times.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The guy who cheated?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah. Geologist, I think.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Damn –</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Then where’s his crampons – his gear?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Maybe down the crevasse?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah, maybe –</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Brits – about eighty miles west.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What the hell where you doing all the way
out here?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Ah Christ – he’s a sticker.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You going to be alright?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: No – this is the kind of stuff that scars you
for life.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Gonna give myself a Goddamn hernia.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Oh yeah – I’m really going to miss this
place.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Who manages the Post Stations?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Dinkle. Howard Dinkle.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: One - two - three…</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Carrie, let’s just bag him and put him on a
plane to McMurdo.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: It bothers me no one’s reported him missing
yet.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Because maybe no one thinks he is.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: How’d he get out there? There were no
tracks.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Sounds to me like you and your gut are talking
again.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Nobody wants to get out of here more than I
do, trust me, but right now – we’re all this guy has.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Grab that side.</p>
<p><strong>carrie’s memory hit</strong>: The well defined chest of a man
wearing a tight T-shirt. A BULLET HOLE dead center.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Stirring up a few things?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …I’ll be alright.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You know, this means a Federal Investigation,
and we’re witnesses. We may get stuck here.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: We both want to do the right thing Carrie – but
we also need to get off the ice. Right now we don’t have to say a word.
When they find something later – hey, we didn’t know. We were leaving,
the body was frozen, we didn’t have time to examine it. No one gets
murdered in Antarctica. Think about it. Dead is dead.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Exactly, this is the first murder in
Antarctica, Doc – and I can’t just pretend it didn’t happen.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Why did I know you were going to say that?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What camp was he with?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m on my way to find out.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This is all I need right now.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m sure his family’s thinking the same
thing.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That’s not what I meant.</p>
<p>****: I’ll contact the FBI – see how they want to handle this.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I hate interrupting educational programming,
but –</p>
<p><strong>last guy</strong>: Marshal.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Chaplain.</p>
<p><strong>dinkle</strong>: Am I in some kind of trouble?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What are they doing out there?</p>
<p><strong>dinkle</strong>: Collecting meteorites.</p>
<p>****: One One has an extremely old surface with low sediment
deposition.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: English, please.</p>
<p><strong>dinkle</strong>: Means it’s a good place to look for
meteorites.</p>
<p>****: It’s right here.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I don’t get it – Weiss was no where near
Delta One One.</p>
<p><strong>dinkle</strong>: One sec –</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Isn’t that a little unusual this close to
Winter-over?</p>
<p><strong>dinkle</strong>: Yes, it is. Really unusual, actually.</p>
<p>****: I guess I should’ve contacted them, but –</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: – You’ve been a little busy. Yeah, I can see
that.</p>
<p><strong>dinkle</strong>: Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Delta One One, this is United States
Marshall Carrie Stetko, come back, over.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: Marshal, it’s Jamie. I’ve got some guy
holding from Vostok who won’t give his name, says he has to talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Vostok?</p>
<p>****: Patch it through.</p>
<p><strong>jamie</strong>: You’re on now.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: This is Marshal Stetko, who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: John Mooney.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Mooney?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: You know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What happened out there, Mooney?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: You come to Vostok and we’ll talk. Only
you.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Where’s Rubin?</p>
<p><strong>mooney</strong>: Come to Vostok.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Getting drunk already?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Just gearing my liver up in case I have to stay
the next six months.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Murphy’s contacting the Feds.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You’re making my day.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’ll do everything I can to get you off this
ice, promise.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I know you will.</p>
<p>****: What’s the hurry?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Going to Vostok.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: What’s he doing in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: We’re tracking it now.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I need a plane to Vostok.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: I don’t control the weather – you want to
stay the winter, then don’t be ready for your evac.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m not asking.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: What am I supposed to tell the deep drill
ice core team getting picked up in four and a half?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Tell them I took their plane.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: Vostok Station Population: 46 Temperature:
-73�</p>
<p>****: What’s with this place?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: The Russians barely supply Vostok anymore.
They have to barter with other bases for supplies. Some of these guys
have been rotting here for years.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Who’s in charge?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Who’s asking?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Stetko, US Marshal. I’m here to talk to an
American named Mooney.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: So many people come through Vostok. Is hard to
remember.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I figured.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Mister Mooney, yes. I remember now. He offers
pay us to fly him off Antarctica on our transport. We give him very good
price - because plane leaves a week ago!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Red storm line.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: You don’t carry a gun?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Against the law – Antarctica’s the only
place in the world you can’t have one. Part of the Treaty.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Doesn’t that make you feel kind of naked?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: All this crap on – I prefer naked.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Gettin’ worse. Minus eighty-one. Wind at a
hundred and ten knots.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Do you have to do that in front of me?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Give you a hand?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Ever been on a rope-line in a whiteout?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Nope. Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Yeah, hold on tight.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Mooney? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …My God.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Jack?</p>
<p><strong>delfy o.c.</strong>: Wo wo wo. It’s okay, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: When you didn’t come back – we went looking
for you. Found a dead guy in the other building – that Mooney?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah. Someone got to him before I did. Then
went after me.</p>
<p>****: How long was I out?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: A couple hours.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Whoever it was, could have flown out after
the storm broke.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Let it go, Delfy.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Until I met you, I hadn’t seen any dead
people. Now I’m at two.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Unless you want your head cracked, I
wouldn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: – Let me see your hands.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Robert Pryce. I’m a United Nations observer for
the Oceanic and Antarctic section. If you relax, I’ve got my ID.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Let’s see it – slowly.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: You must be Stetko –</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: How do you know about Weiss?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: FBI notified us. Your base commander called
it in.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: This is part of a crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: I realize that, but considering the time
constraints we’re up against, let’s be honest, taping and bagging
everything isn’t going to be an option.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’ll be sure to let the U.N. know if I find
out anything.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: You heading out to Delta One One?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: I’ll grab my bag.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Don’t take this personally, but I don’t need
your help.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: If they’ve been digging out there, that’s a
direct violation of the United Nations treaty. We think they were
digging. That makes it my business.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You don’t dig for meteorites.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: And you don’t get killed for them either.
This is now a U.N. matter. I am within my rights to commandeer your
pilot and plane if I have to.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: He can, you know.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Fine. But this is my investigation,
understand? If you obstruct it in any way, I will have you detained.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p>****: Mind if I ask you a personal question?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No, but I have the feeling you’re going to
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Why do you smell like suntan lotion?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Murphy, listen to me, it’s got to be Rubin
who tried to kill me. You have to shut down flights leaving ASB and
McMurdo – search for him.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: That’s not possible. We’re still bringing
people in and resupplying other bases for Winter-over.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Sam, I think these guys found something out
there at the camp. I’m going to check it out. Until I find Rubin, no one
leaves the ice. Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: We ready?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Guess so.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Two thirty.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: A.M. or P.M.?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Wonderful. I’ll take this one.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Rubin?</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Uses the end of the flashlight to chip
away a frozen blood sample from the pant leg. Puts it in the baggie.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Someone’s left leg took a hit, lost a lot of
blood. What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Their daily work log.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Looks like my dad’s old lawn mower.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: It’s ground penetrating radar.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Looks like they were surveying sections at a
time.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Areas labeled?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah –</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: At Sections 101 and 102, they spent one
day.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Looks like they hit some really big
meteors.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: About four miles.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Let’s go see what they found.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I want to check something out first.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: I said “which way?”</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: North.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Hurt?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Yeah, a little.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: How long have you been down here,
Marshal?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Almost two years.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: What brought you to the ice?</p>
<p>****: The excitement, mostly.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Everyone down here is running away from
something.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Some shrink tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Yeah, and that I should call my mother more
often</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: And do you?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Every Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Where do you plant your boots?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: They got me working out of Christchurch, New
Zealand. Beautiful country. But this – crazy place to make a living.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I came down to fill in for a Marshal for six
weeks before Winter-over. I met someone, decided to stay.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: He give you that ring I saw? Tell you he was
going to marry you?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No – just gave me a headache.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CARRIE</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Flattered that you even looked.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: This is it.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: There’s nothing here.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Just stop.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: You sure this is right?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Section 104. These are the coordinates.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Maybe you wrote them down wrong.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: This is shaved ice.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Hold my legs!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m slipping!</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Almost got you.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m losing my grip.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Carrie? Can you hear me?</p>
<p>****: Marshal?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Saw a rope in the Cat.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Twisted, and strewn with large
containers scattered at odd angles – victims of an intense IMPACT. The
plane is pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Cargo plane, but I don’t recognize it.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: It’s an Antanov-74. Russian made - - late
fifties. No one’s put these in the air for forty years.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Guess that makes three.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: This isn’t funny –</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Where’s Pryce?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Vodka.</p>
<p>****: Find what you’re looking for?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Just answers.</p>
<p>****: Those are fuel tanks behind you. This plane was outfitted for
long range capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: And by the looks of that safe, must’ve been
transporting something pretty important.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Part of it has been damaged by the crash
and this weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous intruders
until they forced an opening. Discarded tools litter the floor.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: They put some serious work into this.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of
here. There’s blood all over the tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: It’s the Cat!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No signal, you?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: This isn’t going to work, it’s like digging
through concrete with a spoon.</p>
<p>****: We’re going to suffocate before we get out here.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: How long do you figure we’ve got?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Three of us down here – 12, 15 hours at the
most.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: No way. I’m not going out like this. No
way.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What about the Vodka – we could make some
torches, maybe melt the ice?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Fire will burn the O2 quicker.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What choice do we have?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Don’t need my vote.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Hold these.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: All these planes used to have bail- out
hatches.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: We came in through it.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Has to be more than one.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: It’d be on the ceiling in case of an ocean
landing.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Found it!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Or, if the ice is too thick the blast will
come right back at us.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: We can be blown up, suffocate or freeze to
death. Take your pick.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Hallelujah –</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Delfy, help me with this. We’ll need to get
up higher.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Yeah – what’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Our friend here isn’t who he says he is.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: I’ve been authorized because of what’s
happened.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Stop lying to me –</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Man, the guy just saved our lives…</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: He was saving his own. Do it.</p>
<p>****: Now, who are you?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Have you got an ID for that too?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Listen to me – Forty eight hours ago, we
picked up chatter between someone down here and Tahir Soufian, a black
market trader in New York. It was all about setting up a buy for
cannisters found in an old Russian transport buried in the ice.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Damn, I knew that government eavesdropping
was true.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: There’s been rumors for years that the
Russians had a second base – a secret weapons research facility under
the ice that supposedly blew up in the late sixties – nothing was ever
confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PRYCE</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Why did you lie to me?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Look, the U.N. carries a lot of weight down
here. Think about it - - if I had told you I was C.I.A., you would have
been on the horn back to Washington in no time. This is a very sensitive
matter. News travels fast down here, I don’t have to tell you that.</p>
<p>****: Besides, I didn’t know if I could trust you.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: Keys are still in it!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Plane could’ve gone anywhere. There’s
forty-six countries here all counting down to Winter-over. Rubin could
just disappear in the mayhem.</p>
<p>****: Where the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Heading back. How many fly-ins to McMurdo in
the last four hours?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: You expect me to –</p>
<p>****: – How many?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I need a list of names.</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: You think Rubin might try to leave out of
McMurdo?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: He knows I’m on his ass, so he might.
Anything’s possible. I want to eliminate his options.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Six cannisters, maybe four inches in
diameter, about a foot high – find out exactly what the Russians
transported in something that size.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Back at ASB –</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: How long to get there?</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: When we get back to the plane, I’ll get ya
there in forty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: I’ll scan a picture of him and get it to you.
Meanwhile, contact every non-American base down here and put them on
watch. He’s got some plan to get these off the ice.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I know why Weiss was so far from Delta One
One.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: You need to get that looked at.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’ll have the Doc take a peek when we’re
done.</p>
<p><strong>dinkle</strong>: Murphy’s looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Murphy? What the hell is he doing</p>
<p><strong>dinkle</strong>: Came in on the evac.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m on 30 if you need me. Rubin’s picture is
in a file on my desk.</p>
<p><strong>dinkle</strong>: Make sure I get that back.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>tech</strong>: It’s packing winds of a hundred thirty
knots.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Shit – we’ve got to move up the evac.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Six hours at least.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Jesus, I got crew that’s still not in.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Then get them in!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You wanted to see me?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Where the hell have you been?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Buried under 2 tons of ice. You?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Do me a favor, you find any more bodies,
mind not parading them down the main corridor. I’ve got Newbies afraid
to winterover, for Chirstsake. They want out on seats I don’t have. And
next time you want to take a Goddamn plane anywhere, you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Sure thing, Chief.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We don’t have enough supplies for all of us
to Winter-over if we get stuck down here.</p>
<p>****: And you wonder why it didn’t work out between us.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: It didn’t work, Sam, because you couldn’t
keep your hands off every new woman who stepped foot on the ice down
here. I was stupid enough to be one of them. Now if you could cut
through your red tape for just one second, you would realize that
someone’s out there with six cannisters, possibly full of Uranium, and
he wants to get it into the hands of some very bad people. And I’m
trying to stop it – so fuck asking you for shit, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: This is ridic—</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Enough!</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: DOC</p>
<p>****: Why don’t you try helping her for a change?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You know what Doc, it’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m worried about you. Is it going to take
another attempt on your life to get you to finally slow down?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You worry too much – but it’s what I like
about you.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I striped him down to put him in a bodybag.
There’s only the puncture from the axe. No way, I would have noticed it.
Why?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Then it’s gotta be Rubin.</p>
<p>****: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Any word from the FBI?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: There’s no way they’re gonna make it. Not
with that storm coming in over the peninsula.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Jesus, Carrie, how long did you let this
go?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: When did I go to Vostok?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Feel that?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Now?</p>
<p>****: No way. Don’t tell me that.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: The fingers are dead, Carrie. If I don’t do it
now, gangrene will set in. You’ll lose your hand.</p>
<p><strong>carrie’s memory hit</strong>: AN IMAGE SHE SAW EARLIER: The
well defined chest of a man wearing a T-shirt. A BULLET HOLE oozes dead
center. This time we stay there a little longer, watching the T-shirt
absorb the blood around the wound. As the stain widens, so does the
camera… slowly… bringing into picture THE MAN Carrie shot. He’s wearing
a MARSHAL’S BADGE around his neck.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: There, finished.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: I stopped by the clinic… Doc told me.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Pretty tough Marshal, huh?</p>
<p>****: If you came to propose, now’s not really a good time.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Got Rubin’s face all over Antarctica, but
nobody’s seen him yet.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: …You ever kill anyone?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: …Unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Anyone you ever trusted?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I hadn’t held a gun in my hand for over two
years.</p>
<p>****: Wasn’t supposed to need one down here.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: We were on a stakeout at a Holiday Inn in
Miami, waiting for this buy to go down. I was excited, we’d been after
this trafficker for a long time. Thought this bust would be my big
chance to impress the brass. Anyway, guy’s a no show. One hour went by,
then two - - nothing.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: CARRIE</p>
<p>****: But he was my partner and I killed him that night. There’s no
changing that.</p>
<p>****: God, I was young and stupid, and in way over my head.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: It’s what the Russians used to transport
weapons grade materials in. They match the dimensions inside the safe.
We’re looking for six of these.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: These beakers where really in over their
heads.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Dinkle, it’s Rhonda –</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: I better get this back to him. And we have to
find Rubin.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Think you can you help me with these
buttons, first?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: …You Stetko?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>rubin</strong>: – Did Mooney talk to you? I didn’t hear from
him – he was supposed to call me after you talked.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Mooney’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>rubin</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: And so’s Weiss.</p>
<p><strong>rubin</strong>: And I’m next, I know it.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: It’s okay, you’re safe, just put the knife
down.</p>
<p><strong>rubin</strong>: Weiss didn’t want to go through with it. Oh
God. How did we let this happen?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Rubin – I need you to focus for me.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Carrie, it’s Doc – got those painkillers.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: It’s okay, he’s a doctor, he can help
you.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Rubin’s here! He’s on the run. Level one.
White T-shirt. Jeans.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Rubin, wait!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Rubin – I can help you!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Door’s jammed –</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Shit, Rubin doesn’t have any gear on.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: How long’s he been out there?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>rubin</strong>: …Help me.</p>
<p><strong>rubin</strong>: W..wa..wait.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Sam!</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: I sh… sh… shoulda killed you at Vostok.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Where are the cannisters?</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Wrong answer.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Help me drag him over here.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Who’s Tahir selling it to – what’s the
intended target?</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: What’re you doing, you crazy bitch?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Why did you kill those scientists, Keller?
Was a four-way split too much for you?</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Where is the uranium?</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: You have no idea what’s going on here, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Hit the sonofabitch again!</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: The plane, they’re in the fucking plane.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Have you completely lost your mind?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Let go of me.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Find them yourself.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: What the hell’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: The cannisters are on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Who the hell are you?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Name’s Pryce.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: He’s with the UN. We have to search that
plane now!</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: We don’t have time. We’ll just search it in
Christchurch when it lands.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: It’s a twelve hour flight to Christchurch.
Anything can happen in that time. Keller is here, so we know it’s still
on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: PRYCE</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Sam, do what is right here. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Do what you have to, but that plane takes
off in one hour.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: We’ll need some help.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I’ll send what I can.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: It’s clean.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Nothing. That bastard. What the hell are you
up to, Keller?</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: I don’t get it, why lie to us – we have him
either way. He’s stuck here.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: He’s buying time.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Out of the way!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: He’s got nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: He won’t try. He’s a goddamn pilot.</p>
<p><strong>intercut carrie and pryce</strong>: Carrie eyeballs a
Snowcat. It’s door is slightly open. She heads for it. Gun poised.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: …I didn’t see him.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No! You stay awake!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Press here. Hard. Hard or he will die!</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: It won’t stop!</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: He’s not going to be number four!</p>
<p>****: What are you doing? Get Keller.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: You’re bleeding out. Freezing drops your
pulse. We have to slow it down.</p>
<p>****: You hold on.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: No – what’s going –</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Keller got out. He hurt Pryce – he’s
bleeding bad. Where’s Doc?</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: In the clinic. About to bring the bodies
out. What’s –</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Tell him to stay put, and I need your help
getting Pryce there. We’re at the hangar. I’ve got to stop Keller, he’s
got the cannisters.</p>
<p><strong>keller</strong>: Crazy bitch.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Doc!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Get him on the table!</p>
<p><strong>delfy</strong>: I know, I know, he’ll die!</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: You, four units O-pos in the warmer. Second
shelf, fridge.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Keller hit him with an ice axe.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: He get away?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Sam, it’s Rhonda – we gotta go. Now.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>int. medical clinic - asb - same</strong>: Murphy looks to
Doc.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Can you do this on the plane? It’s your
call, but I need to know now.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’ll stay with you –</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Grab the bodies and get them on the
plane.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Leave the bodies – you don’t have time. Dead is
dead.</p>
<p>****: Pick them up in six months. Go.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Leave’m. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Hey –</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Hey back.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: You get him?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Um-hm.</p>
<p>****: The cannisters?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: What did we miss? Think Keller cut and run
without the stuff?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: After all this, no way. Keller didn’t have
it on the plane because he’s got it hidden somewhere.</p>
<p>****: Where would he hide something for six months. Somewhere he
could be sure no one would ever look.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: If he had made it out, he wouldn’t have been
crazy enough to come back for it.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: True – what the hell was his plan…</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: We’ve got six months to figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Eyes open – that’s always a good sign.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: Hey, Doc – thanks.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Thank her – if she hadn’t slowed your
bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Need any help?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’m good.</p>
<p>****: Just thinking where it all began.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yeah, it’s a damn shame, isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>pryce</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Nothing – I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>continued:</strong>: Storage racks of frozen science samples
line the three walls. Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney,
Rubin, Weiss and Keller.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Someplace no one would ever think to
look.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: If they had just gone along with it.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: And we thought it was nukes the whole
time.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Keller said he knew someone in the states who
could move the diamonds for us. It was a hell of a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: How did you get wrapped up in thing,
Doc?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Weiss got hurt on the plane. They were afraid
to move him, so Mooney called me. Keller and I flew out. But they
couldn’t get the safe open – Keller found a way.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Then Weiss got cold feet. It got ugly,
didn’t it – and Keller killed him at Delta One One. Everything went to
hell after that, didn’t it, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Keller thought he could kill his way out of
this whole thing.</p>
<p>****: If those idiots hadn’t panicked, none of this would have
happened.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Doc – stop.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: I’ll cut you in, Carrie. There’s at least 5
million in diamonds in there. That can buy both of us a nice life back
in the world. How many times have we both talked about having a fresh
start. Well, this is it. Those beakers finding that plane was a sign. A
sign telling me it was time to go back. Now I have something to go back
for.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: There is no granddaughter, is there? This
was about greed, plain and simple.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: No one will ever know. It’s just me and you. We
can take care of Pryce.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Dead is dead, right?</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Yes, yes, now you’re getting it.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: What’s happened to you? There are four
people dead! Four! People we knew.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: It’s either ignore all of this or kill me – and
you and I, we’re too good of friends for me to force you to make that
choice.</p>
<p><strong>carrie</strong>: Doc, your not thinking straight.</p>
<p><strong>doc</strong>: Ya know, it’s really warm. I’m gonna take a
walk – try and cool off.</p>
