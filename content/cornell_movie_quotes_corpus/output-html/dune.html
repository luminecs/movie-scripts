<h1 id="dune">dune</h1>
<p><strong>david lynch</strong>: December 9, 1983</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother ramallo</strong>: We are the secret of the
Universe.</p>
<p><strong>response of twenty thousand voices</strong>: Bi-la kaifa.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother ramallo</strong>: We are the secret of the
Universe. We know of spice…the spice called melange…the greatest
treasure in the Universe. It exists on only one planet - ours Arrakis,
Dune. We know of spice and the Bene Gesserit sisterhood’s selective
breeding plan of ninety generations to produce the Kwisatz Haderach, the
one the spice will awaken.</p>
<p><strong>response of twenty thousand voices</strong>: Bi-la kaifa.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother ramallo</strong>: And now the prophecy…</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother ramallo</strong>: He will come…the voice from
the outer world, bringing the holy war, the Jihad, which will cleanse
the Universe and bring us out of darkness. He will have been born of a
Bene Gesserit mother.</p>
<p><strong>irulan</strong>: Father.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Irulan.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: A Third Stage Guild Navigator will be here
within minutes!</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: We felt his presence.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: I shall want telepathy during his visit and
a report when we’re finished.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Their minds are so…. They move in
strange directions….</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Forced spice evolution of humans
changes many things…. I must sit close to him.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: He will not permit anyone but me to see
him. You must be outside this room…. Do what you can.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: I am your Truthsayer, my lord… He
is here, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>tanked guildsmen #1</strong>: The Bene Gesserit witch must
leave.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Leave us.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Yes, my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: We are alone…</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: We have just folded space from Ix…</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Yes?… How was your journey?</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: Many machines on Ix… new machines.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Oh yes?</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: Better than those on Richesse.. You are
transparent… I see many things… I see plans within plans.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Is there a problem?… Usually there is a
problem when one of you makes a visit.</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: The answer is within the problem…</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: I see two Great Houses – House Atreides,
House Harkonnen – feuding… I see you behind it.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: You must share with us.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: The Atreides house is building a secret
army!… using a technique unknown to us… a technique involving sound. The
Duke is becoming more popular in the Landsraad… he could threaten me…. I
have ordered House Atreides to occupy Arrakis to mine the spice… thus
replacing their enemies the Harkonnens…. House Atreides will not refuse
because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. Then, at an
appointed time Baron Harkonnen will return to Arrakis and launch a sneak
attack on House Atreides… I have promised the Baron five legions of my
Sardaukar terror troops.</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: So the Harkonnens will rid you of House
Atreides…</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: Reverend Mother… I will give you the
Tleilaxu Path.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: A chance for escape? But for
whom?</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Can you hear me?… If this visit has
anything to do with spice…</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: LISTEN TO ME!! The spice must flow… the
spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years… it has
enabled you to live two hundred years… the spice helps make the sapho
juice, which gives the red-lipped mentats the ability to be living
computers… the secret side of spice… the water of life.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: He shouldn’t speak of this…</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: …gives the Bene Gesserit sisterhood the
metaphysical ability to see beyond…to have superior powers… Our power to
fold space is in the spice… Without us, your empire would be lost on
isolated scattered planets… You would be lost.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: I can assure you…</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: Do not interrupt!!! Do not speak lightly
of the spice… ONE SMALL POINT…</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Here it comes…</p>
<p><strong>navigator</strong>: We ourselves… foresee a slight problem
within House Atreides…. Paul…. Paul Atreides.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: You mean, of course, Duke Leto Atreides…
his father.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Here we are now… nineteen light years
beyond…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: … beyond Epsilon Alangue… is Arrakis.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It does look dry….</p>
<p><strong>filmbook</strong>: Each day the palms along the outer wall of
the Palace at Arrakeen consume enough water to sustain the lives of one
hundred men. The palms were placed by the Harkonnens to flaunt their
water wealth in front of the city Fremen.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where are the Harkonnens from here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There!… Geidi Prime and the Baron Harkonnen…
the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know, Thufir, I’m sitting with my back to
the door.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I heard you, Dr. Yueh and Gurney coming down
the hall.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Those sounds could be imitated.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’d know the difference.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Yes. Perhaps he would at that.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My father sent you to test me. Music then?</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: No music. I’m packing this for the crossing.
Shield practice.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shield practice? Gurney… we had practice –
this morning….. I’m not in the mood.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Not in the mood?! Mood’s a thing for cattle
and love play… not fighting.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m sorry Gurney.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Not sorry enough.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Guard yourself for true!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s gotten into Gurney? He’s not
faking.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is this what you seek?</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Good… the slow blade penetrates the shield…
but look down.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: We’d have joined each other in death.
However, you did seem to finally get the “mood”.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Would you really have drawn my blood?</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: If you’d fought one whit below your
abilities I’d have scratched you a good one.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Things have been so serious here lately.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Yes. I sensed the play in you lad, but this
can no longer be play. Tomorrow we leave for Arrakis! Arrakis is real.
The Harkonnens are real.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Dr. Yueh, do you have any information on the
worms of Arrakis?</p>
<p><strong>dr. yueh</strong>: I have obtained a filmbook on a small
specimen… only 125 meters long.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Only?!</p>
<p><strong>dr. yueh</strong>: There are have been documented sightings
of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert – far from where
we’ll be in Arakeen…. The desert belt and the south polar regions are
marked forbidden…. Why?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The storms and the worms. Is it true, that the
sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour?</p>
<p><strong>yueh</strong>: It can render flesh to dust in minutes. And
these dry winds can generate tremendous static electricity in the
atmosphere. Our body shields won’t have enough power to operate in the
open air on Arrakis.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, how do the Fremen survive there?</p>
<p><strong>yueh</strong>: We don’t know much about the Fremen… They live
in the deep desert… some of them in the cities and they have blue-
within-blue eyes…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The eyes – yes, yes… saturation of the blood
by the spice – melange. Could the spice affect us in other ways?</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Many dangers exist on Arrakis. For one, we
know the Harkonnens would not have given up their CHOAM company contract
so easily.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The Harkonnens are our enemies, yes… but
behind them, I suspect, is the Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: You will make a formidable Duke!</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Now remember… the first step in avoiding a
trap is knowing of its existence.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know. But if it is a trap then why are we
going?</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: We have our new army. Dr. Yueh, put the
weirding module on him.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Clear and lock the room.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Activate a fighter.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Precise control….</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The bull that killed my grandfather… is this
an evil omen?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Duncan!</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: Paul. I was on my way to say goodbye to you.
I have to go on ahead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why? I wish you were coming with us.</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: It’s something for your father. He wants to
talk to you. I’ll see you in Arrakis. May the hand of God be with
you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: May the hand of God be with us all,
Duncan.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Father.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Thank you for joining me, Paul. It will
be good to get to our new home and have all this upset behind us.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: My son. Thufir Hawat has served House
Atreides three generations…. He swears you are the finest student he’s
ever taught. Yueh, Gurney and Duncan say the same…. It makes me feel
very proud…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I want you to be proud of me.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: I’ll miss the sea… but a person needs new
experiences… they jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow.
Without change, something sleeps inside us… and seldom awakens… The
sleeper must awaken.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Arrakis… Dune… Desert Planet…Arrakis… Desert
Planet… moving… moving.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Arrakis… Dune… Desert Planet.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: The second moon, your moon…</p>
<p><strong>beautiful girl</strong>: Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I know she has come to test him… no man has
ever been tested with the box… only Bene Gesserit women. I may lose my
son.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Arrakis… Dune… Desert planet… moving…
moving.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: We’ll salvage what we can… but I
can tell you.. dear God… for the father… nothing.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Did you really think that you could
bear the Kwisatz Haderach?… How dare you!</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: My greatest student… and my
greatest disappointment…. He’s awake!… He’s listening to us. Good… Ready
yourself, young Paul Atreides… I want to see you in your mother’s
chamber in one quarter of an hour.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Paul?… This is very important…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kwisatz Haderach?… For the father…
nothing?</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Jessica… You were told to bear only
daughters to the Atreides… Jessica!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: It meant so much to him…</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: You thought only of a Duke’s desire
for a son?… Desires don’t figure in this! An Atreides daughter could
have been wed to a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. We may lose
both blood lines now.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I vowed never to regret my decision. I’ll
pay for my own mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: And your son will pay with you.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Paul, this is the Reverend Mother Gaius
Helen Mohiam. She is going to… observe you… Please…</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Jessica, you know it must be done.
I enjoin you to stand guard at the door and practice the meditation of
peace.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Your Reverence.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What does she fear? What about my Father?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Paul… please, Paul… listen to the Reverend
Mother and do what she tells you.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Now you come here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s using The Voice. No.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Some strength there. Surprising!
Come here.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: See this… Put your right hand in
the box.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What’s in the box?</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Pain.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: STOP! Put your hand in the box.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The Voice again.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: I hold at your neck the gom jabbar.
Don’t pull away or you’ll feel that poison. A Duke’s son must know about
many poisons – this one kills only animals.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you suggesting a Duke’s son is an
animal?</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Let us say I suggest you may be
human. Your awareness may be powerful enough to control your instincts.
Your instincts will be to remove your hand from the box. If you do so
you will die. You will feel an itching – there… see? Now the itching
becomes burning… heat, upon heat, upon heat.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It burns.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear
is the little death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear…
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: You feel the flesh crisping?</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Flesh dropping off.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: NO!! ENOUGH!! Kull wahad! No woman
child ever withstood that much. I must have wanted you to fail. Take
your hand out of the box and look at it, young human…. Do it!</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Pain by nerve induction… A human
can resist any pain. Our test is crisis and observation.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I see the truth of it.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Could he be the one?… Maybe… but
will he be ours to control? You know when people speak the truth?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know it.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Your mother wants you to tell me
about your dreams. I only want to know one thing…. Do they come
true?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Not all of them… I know which ones will.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Perhaps you are the Kwisatz
Haderach.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: The person who can be many places
at once… the one who bridges space and time…. He will look where we
cannot.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Do you know of the Water of Life?…
the Truthsayer drug?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I have heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: It is very dangerous… very painful.
The Bene Gesserit sisterhood drink it to see within…. There is a place
terrifying to us… to women. It is said a man will come… the Kwisatz
Haderach… he will go where we cannot… Many men have tried…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did they try and fail?</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: They tried and died…. Jessica!</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: I sense your teachings in him.
Ignore the regular order of training. His safety requires The Voice.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve heard enough of my safety… What about my
father?… I heard you talking. You speak as if he was dead. Well, he
isn’t!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Paul!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well he isn’t… and he won’t die… Tell me he
won’t die!</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: What can be done has been done.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: MOTHER! Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: It is by will alone I set my mind in motion.
It is by the juice of Sapho that thoughts acquire speed - The lips
acquire stains - The stains become a warning - It is by will alone I set
my mind in motion.</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: My Lord!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Piter.</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: The Atreides will be leaving Caladan soon,
Baron, and I have here your answer from Duke Leto.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: What does Leto say, Piter?</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: He wishes to inform you that Vendetta – as he
puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of Kanly – is still alive. He
does not wish to meet or speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I made my peace gesture… the forms of Kanly
have been obeyed.</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: As you instructed me, I have enlightened your
nephews concerning my plan t…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: My plan!</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: The plan to crush the Atreides. Feyd, Rabban…
go quietly… no other great house of the Landsraad must ever know of the
Emperor’s aid to the Baron. The entire Landsraad would turn against the
Baron and the Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Put the pick in there Pete And turn it round
real neat.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You’re so beautiful my Baron Your skin, love
to me Your diseases lovingly cared for For all eternity.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I will have Arrakis back for myself… he who
controls the Spice, controls the universe… and what Piter didn’t tell
you is we have control of someone who is very close to Duke Leto. This
person… this traitor… will be worth more to us than ten legions of
Sardaukar.</p>
<p><strong>feyd</strong>: Who is the traitor?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I won’t tell you who the traitor is or when
we’ll attack. However, the Duke will die before these eyes and he’ll
know that it is I – Baron Vladimir Harkonnen – who encompasses his
doom.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I must not fear. Fear is the mind- killer…
the little death that brings total obliteration…</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Soon they’ll begin to fold space.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Far off in the control rooms…. Travelling
without moving.</p>
<p><strong>atreides technician</strong>: Harkonnens.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Why isn’t the shield up yet?</p>
<p><strong>atreides radio man</strong>: We found and removed another
sabotage device. I think it will go up now.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: We found these sabotage devices too
easily…</p>
<p><strong>dr. yueh</strong>: Listen here…. You can here the people of
Arrakeen outside…. Can you here the cry “Soo Soo Sook” of the water
sellers?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: So many reminders of the scarcity of
water.</p>
<p><strong>dr. yueh</strong>: Have you noticed the line of palms along
the wall… the Harkonnen put them in… to flaunt their water wealth in
front of these people…. Each day those palms take enough water to
sustain the life of one hundred men.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: The way you say Harkonnen… I didn’t know
you had so much reason to hate them.</p>
<p><strong>dr. yueh</strong>: My wife… you didn’t know my wife…
they…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Forgive me… … His wife was Bene Gesserit
too… the signs are al over him…. They must have killed here.</p>
<p><strong>dr. yueh</strong>: I’m sorry I’m unable to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>atreides woman #1</strong>: My lady… the local people… the
maids and servants await your inspection. Hawat has cleared them.</p>
<p><strong>dr. yueh</strong>: The Harkonnens may have tampered
medically…. please wait.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He’s hiding something – holding something
back. It’s not just his wife… He’s a good man though. He’s probably
trying to save my feelings… I could use The Voice… make him tell me… It
would only shame him. I must place more trust in my friends.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: One carryall handles four spice mining
teams; however, it will fly only two harvesters at a time. Today, we
have nine hundred and thirty harvesters and nine hundred and eighty-one
carryalls….</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Spice…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Terrible purpose…. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>shadout mapes</strong>: I am the Shadout Mapes… the
housekeeper.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A Fremen… Could she be the operator? No…</p>
<p><strong>shadout mapes</strong>: I must cleanse the way between us….
You saved my life… and we Fremen pay our debts. It’s known to us that
you’ve a traitor in your midst. Who it is we cannot say but we’re
certain of it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A traitor…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There is a traitor among us.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Set up a sonar probe immediately!</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Thufir?… anything?… keep looking. …and a
traitor… God help us.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Sector 6 - 80 – copy the sixth – the summit
– the eight the quadrant over the ninth plus eighty – four circles –
weave the eighty and call the fourth copy – enter nine – seven by seven
a seven the seven call seven B seven – enter the circles call the sixth
copy the sixth over the summit…. eight.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Eight…. Thufir Hawat… Mentat… Master of
Assassins.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: The Palace is now secure. The city of
Arrakeen is under martial law… we have troops here headquartered
underground on sub-floors six through ten. The rest of the troops are
stationed in Arrakeen and we have some on the airfield. Our new army is
still training, but everything is shielded…. With the shielding, we are
impenetrable. Dr. Kynes is waiting, Sire, for your inspection of spice
mining operations, but since the attempt of the young master, I am
against your leaving the Palace.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: The attempt failed… Harkonnen captives
have already been taken. We must crush the Harkonnen machine on
Arrakis…. You all know what to do. …Gurney! We desperately need more
spice miners… many are threatening to leave on the next shuttle. We need
spice drivers, weather scanners, dune men … any with open sand
experience. You must persuade them to enlist with us.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: They shall come all for violence: their
faces shall sup as the east wind. And they shall gather the captivity of
the sand.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Very moving, Gurney. On your way… and
take care of Dr. Kynes until Paul and I arrive. We will not be prisoners
here in this place.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Behold as a wild ass in the desert go I
forth to my work.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I must speak with you Leto!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>shadout mapes</strong>: I am the Shadout Mapes, your
housekeeper, Noble Born. What are your orders.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: You may refer to me as “my lady.” I am not
noble born. I’m the bound concubine of Duke Leto – mother of the heir
designate…. “Shadout”… that’s an ancient word.</p>
<p><strong>mapes</strong>: You know the ancient tongues?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I know the Bhotani Jib and Chakobsa, all
the hunting languages.</p>
<p><strong>mapes</strong>: As the legend says.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: That’s it! The Missionaria Protectiva has
been here planting protective legends against a day of Bene Gesserit
need. And that day has come. I must play out this sham. I know the Dark
things and the way of the Great Mother. Miseces prejin.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I know many things. I know you came
prepared for violence with a weapon in your bodice.</p>
<p><strong>mapes</strong>: My lady, I… the weapon was sent as a gift if
you should prove to be the one.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: And the means of my death should I prove
otherwise. Now we will see which way the decision tips.</p>
<p><strong>mapes</strong>: Do you know this my lady?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: It could only be one thing…. It’s a
crysknife.</p>
<p><strong>mapes</strong>: Say it not lightly… Do you know its
meaning?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Here is why this Fremen has taken service
with me, to ask that one question. Delay is as dangerous as the wrong
answer. Shadout is Chakobsa… knife, in Chakobsa is… maker of death. It’s
a maker…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Maker?… Maker is the key word… the tooth of
the worm? That was close… Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of
the Great Mother, would not know the maker?</p>
<p><strong>mapes</strong>: My lady, when one has lived with prophecy for
so long, the moment of revelation is a shock.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: There’s more here… yes! Mapes, you’ve
sheathed that blade unblooded.</p>
<p><strong>mapes</strong>: Take the water of my life!</p>
<p><strong>mapes</strong>: You are ours…. You are the one.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: So, this is Leto the Just…</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: I hope I made myself clear. You may call him
“The Duke,” “My lord,” or “Sire.” And there is a more ancient term you
might keep in mind – “Noble Born.”</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Play out your little comedy while you can
off-worlders…</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: So you are Dr. Kynes, the Imperial
Ecologist?</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: I prefer the more ancient term,
planetologist… Noble Born.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: This is my son, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you a Fremen?</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: I am a servant of the His Majesty the
Emperor. I have served His Majesty on Arrakis long enough for my eyes to
change.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: He’s hiding something.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: I understand we have you to thank for
these stillsuits, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: They are Fremen suits. I hope they fit well,
my lord.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: “Your gift is a blessing of the river.”</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: The Mahdi will greet you with holy words and
your gifts will be a blessing. Most of the desert natives here are a
superstitious lot. They mean no harm. With your permission, I will check
the security of your suits.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: The Duke is to be addresses as…</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Basically…</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Sire!</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: It’s all right Gurney.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Yes, Sire.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: It’s a high-efficiency filter and heat
exchange system. Perspiration passes through the first layer and is
gathered in the second. The salt is separated. Breathing and walking
provide the pumping action. The reclaimed water circulates to
catchpockets from which you can drink through this tube at your neck.
Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads. Should you be in the
open desert, remember to breathe in through your mouth, out through the
nose tubes.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: With a Fremen suit in good working order, one
can sustain life for weeks, even in the deep desert.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: My thanks.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: With your permission…</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: You’ve worn a stillsuit before?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Your suit is fitted desert fashion. Who told
you how to do that?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No one. It… seemed the proper way.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: That it is. He shall know your ways as if
born to them.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: We’re wasting time, Sire.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I must speak with you Leto!</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Southeast over the Shield Wall. That’s where
I told your sandmaster to concentrate his harvesting.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Will we see a worm?</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Where there is spice and spice mining there
are always worms.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Always?</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why do they come?</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: To protect their territory. Vibrations
attract them.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ve registered him now… a knife is a sheath
on his left arm… He’s strong… a person born to command… He’s hiding many
things. Is there a relationship between the worms and the spice?</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: The young master is a trained Mentat, an
advanced student of Prana Bindu has studied under some of the finest
teachers in the Universe.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: As I said… they defend the spice sands. As to
their relationship with the spice… who knows.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Dust cloud ahead, Sire.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: That’s it… spice mining… no other cloud quite
like it. See the spotters over it? They’re watching for wormsign… the
telltale sand waves. Seismic probes on the surface, too Sire… worms can
travel too deep for their waves to show… Looks like a good patch of
spice.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Wormsign? Is it wormsign?</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Yes!… worm. Big one! You’ve got sharp eyes
Sire…. May I?</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Calling Harvester Pad Nine. Wormsign!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who calls Pad Nine?</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Don’t mention the Duke… This is an uncoded
channel.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Unlisted flight northeast of you… wormsign on
intercept course… estimated contact fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Have sighting confirmed. Stand by for fix.
Contact in sixteen minutes minus. Very precise estimate. Who is on that
unlisted flight?</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: What happens now?</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: The carryall will come and lift off the spice
harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester… you’ll find this
interesting Sire.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: They’ll work until the very last minute.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Spotter control… no sign of the carryall… it
isn’t answering.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: The worm is eight minutes away, Sire.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Spotter control – give me a report by the
numbers.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Damn it… Harkonnens.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: We are coming down to take you off the
harvester… All spotters are ordered to comply.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ordered by whom?</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Duke Leto Atreides….</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes… yes, Sire!</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: How many men do you have?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Full crew – twenty-six men – but Sire, we
can’t leave this spice…</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Damn the spice! Get out of there.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Two men in each of the spotters… You!…
over here… run!!</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: I can’t see him yet but he’s very close…</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Damn sloppy – really damn sloppy.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Come on boys… come on. We’re going to be
heavy, Sire.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Here he is… We’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Spice!… pure un-refined spice!</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Bless the Maker and his water… Bless the
coming and going of him. May his passage cleanse the world.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: What’s that you’re saying?</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>spice miner #1</strong>: Liet!</p>
<p><strong>spice miner #2</strong>: Shhhhh.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Liet?</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: You are about to witness something few have
seen – watch! Watch!</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Gods, what a monster.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Someone is going to pay for this… I
promise.</p>
<p><strong>kynes</strong>: This Duke is more concerned over his men than
the spice! I must admit… against all better judgement… I like this
Duke.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Duncan! What have you discovered about
the Fremen, Duncan – tell me. Why haven’t we heard from you?</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: My lord… I suspect so much. I think they are
the allies we seek… they are strong and fierce… they do not give their
loyalty easily or quickly…. As you know, the Imperium has never been
able to take a census of the Fremen. Everyone thinks that there are but
few – wandering here and there in the desert…. My lord, I suspect an
incredible secret has been kept on this planet… that the Fremen exist in
vast numbers… vast numbers… and it is they that control Arrakis.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto’s voice</strong>: Guard. Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Sleep well… my son.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Father!… father… drugged…</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: What happened? What? The shield!</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Yueh! He’s sabotaged the house
generators, we’re wide open.</p>
<p><strong>yueh</strong>: I’ve brought House Atreides down. I’ve
destroyed the new army’s weirding modules.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: … Why?</p>
<p><strong>yueh</strong>: I wish to kill a man… not you, my dear Duke,
but the Baron…. You were dead already… but you will be close to the
Baron before you die. You will be tied and drugged but you can still
attack. When you see the Baron you will have a new poison tooth. He will
want you close so he can gloat over you. One bite on this tooth and a
strong exile…</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Refuse…</p>
<p><strong>yueh</strong>: No! – You mustn’t… for in return I will save
the lives of your Paul and Jessica.</p>
<p><strong>yueh</strong>: For Paul…</p>
<p><strong>yueh</strong>: When you see the Baron, remember the tooth!
The tooth!</p>
<p><strong>atreides guard #1</strong>: The shield is down! The shield is
down!</p>
<p><strong>atreides guard captain</strong>: Harkonnen… Get that shield
up!</p>
<p><strong>atreides guard</strong>: The shield! The shield!</p>
<p><strong>troopers</strong>: Long live Duke Leto!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: The drug was timed. Dr. Yueh has been very
valuable to us…. What a pity you must remain gagged. We can’t let
ourselves be swayed by your witch’s Voice, now, can we?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Leto… where are you?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Goodbye, Jessica and goodbye to your sweet
son…. I want to spit once on your head… just some spittle on your face –
what a luxury.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: We were ordered to kill them… so kill
them.</p>
<p><strong>nefud</strong>: What are your orders, Piter?</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: Take them to the desert, as the traitor
suggested and worms will destroy the evidence. Their bodies must never
be found.</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: spittle around on her face with his</p>
<p><strong>duncan</strong>: They’re on this floor somewhere….</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Duncan!! Duncan!!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You wish now to join your wife, is that it,
traitor?</p>
<p><strong>yueh</strong>: She lives?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You wish to join her… join her, then.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Take him away.</p>
<p><strong>rabban</strong>: He was in the Palace with the Atreides… I
also say he was a spy for the Emperor. Go now! Take him to his desert to
die. Go!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yueh’s sign. He’s left a satchell.</p>
<p><strong>harkonnen guard #1</strong>: I’d like to have some fun before
we kill her.</p>
<p><strong>harkonnen guard #2</strong>: Of course… what did you
think?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t touch my mother…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh great mother! He’s trying the voice. The
Reverend Mother said it could save him.</p>
<p><strong>harkonnen guard #1</strong>: Did you hear a noise from the
little one?</p>
<p><strong>harkonnen guard #2</strong>: I didn’t hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>harkonnen guard #1</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>harkonnen guard #2</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: The calming exercise.</p>
<p><strong>harkonnen guard #1</strong>: The little one!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Remove her gag!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Excellent!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: There’s no need to fight over me.</p>
<p><strong>harkonnen guard #1</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: First cut my son’s bonds.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Duke Leto Atreides. Someone’s torn the
insignia off your uniform. Such carelessness.</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: It was Feyd.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: It was Feyd? It was Feyd! Where is the ducal
signet ring? I must have his ring.</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: The ring?… he was brought to us as is, Baron.
I…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You killed the doctor too soon, you fool!</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Yueh… Yueh… dead… Paul and Jessica safe…
the tooth!</p>
<p><strong>piter</strong>: He’s coming round, my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Wait… he must be near…</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Where is your ring?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: You do not answer!</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: A… little… closer…. The… water… of my
life… for Paul.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: He’s crying! He’s crying! He’s crying, Piter.
What does he mean?</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Leto! Leto!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Leto! He’s dead! He’s dead…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know I have NO FEELINGS!! Why?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I’m alive!!! I’m alive!!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I can’t maintain any altitude… we’ll never
reach the safety of rock. Maybe that small rock.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Where are we do you think?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The South Polar regions… the forbidden area.
We must make it to that rock…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Bring these satchels!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hurry – This crashing may bring a worm.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: A million deaths are not enough for
Yueh…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where are my feelings… I feel for no one…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The second moon… from the dreams…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: House Atreides is ruined. This moon holds my
past.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This moon holds my future.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I am only a seed…</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: The seed must grow.</p>
<p><strong>duke leto</strong>: The sleeper must awaken.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Listen to me!… you wanted to know about my
dreams… and I’ve just had a waking dream… do you know why?…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Calm yourself/</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The spice! It’s in everything here. The air,
the soil, the food… It’s like the Truthsayer drug….. It’s a poison!!!!
You knew the spice would change me. But thanks to your teachings it’s
changed my consciousness. I can see it… I can see it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Is he….?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You carry my unborn sister in your womb!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: He knows.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You and your Bene Gesserit sisterhood… I’m not
your Kwisatz Haderach… I’m something different, something unexpected!
I’m a seed. I am so much more… You don’t begin to know me…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Father… now I have become a killer and I will
continue to kill until I have avenged your death. Father!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Rabban!!… we’re knee deep in Atreides blood!
We’ve gutted them. We’ve gutted them!</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Rabban, Rabban… I place you in charge of
Arrakis. It’s yours to squeeze, as I promised. I want you to squeeze and
squeeze and squeeze. Give me spice! Drive them into utter submission.
You must not show the slightest pity or mercy… as only you can… Never
stop! Go…. Show no mercy!</p>
<p><strong>rabban</strong>: Yes, my lord Baron.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: And when we’ve crushed these people enough
I’ll send in you Feyd… they’ll cheer you as a rescuer… lovely Feyd…
really a lovely boy. Where’s my doctor?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yueh’s left the plans for the weirding
modules.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We have to get to that mountain of rock. We
have entered the time when all will turn against us and seek our
lives…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s further than I thought… a worm is sure to
come…. I’ll plant a thumper, that should divert it.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: …the night is a tunnel… a hole into
tomorrow… if we’re to have a tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Remember… walk without rhythm and we won’t
attract a worm… it’ll go to the thumper.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Keep going…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Faster!!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: It’s deafening!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I can’t… I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Drum sand!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Cinnamon… the spice! Do you smell it?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know the secret. The worm is the spice… the
spice is the worm.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Paul!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A thumper.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What’s happened?… Why did it leave?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Someone started another thumper…. We’re not
alone.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Man-carved steps.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Perhaps these are the ones Mapes told us
of.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Are you trained in the ways of the
desert?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No, but many consider my training
valuable.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: I will take the boy-man… he shall have
sanctuary in my tribe…</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Stop! Get back!! She has the weirding way.
Why didn’t you tell us! Great gods… if you can do this to the strongest
of us you’re worth ten times your weight of water. As a leader of my
people I give you my bond: teach us this weirding way and you both shall
have sanctuary. Your water shall mingle with our water.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Then I will teach you our way of battle….
you have the word bond of a Bene Gesserit.</p>
<p><strong>a fremen</strong>: It is the legend.</p>
<p><strong>chani</strong>: I am Chani, daughter of Liet…. I would not
have permitted you to harm my tribe.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: From my dream… so beautiful. Liet…. is this
Kynes’ daughter?</p>
<p><strong>chani</strong>: Come with me. I’ll show you an easier way
down.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: You have strength… real strength… You shall
be known as Usul, which is the strength of the base of the pillar. This
is your secret name in our troop. But you must choose the name of
manhood which we will call you openly.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What do you call the mouse shadow in the
second moon?</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: We call that one Muad’dib.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Could I be known as Paul Muad’dib?</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: You are Paul Muad’dib, and your mother
shall be a Sayyadina among us…. We welcome you.</p>
<p><strong>chani</strong>: Seitch Tabr.</p>
<p><strong>chani</strong>: Tell me of your homeworld, Usul.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Moisture…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wind traps… huge ones.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Water on Arrakis!!! I have seen this place in
a dream. A treasure.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Greater than treasure, Usul. We have
thousands of such caches. Only a few of us know them all. When we have
enough… we shall change the face of Arrakis. Listen!…</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: The Rocks of Arrakis hold many secrets.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: We sense that you may be the “voice from the
outer world”. Both moons told us of you. You must pass tests before we
will know… you must conquer the beast of the desert, both his outer and
his deadly inner powers. Speak to us… from the outer world.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I am only a seed. I am Usul… Paul
Muad’dib.</p>
<p><strong>crowds</strong>: Muad’dib!</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: The legend.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No one ever dreamed there would be so many.
Our shared enemy the Harkonnens, are once again in control of Arrakis.
Stilgar, your leader, has asked me and my mother to crush the
Harkonnens. We must do more than this. We must totally destroy all spice
production on Arrakis. The Guild and the entire universe depends on
spice.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The weirding way has long been a Bene Gesserit
secret. With my mother’s help, my father isolated an element of the
weirding way and externalised it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Because of the Harkonnen treachery, my
father’s armies were never able to fully develop this new form. This is
what I will teach you. You will be the fiercest and most feared fighters
in the Universe.</p>
<p><strong>orato</strong>: Break!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Move back!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Chuksa!</p>
<p><strong>100 fremen</strong>: Achiii!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: This is part of the weirding way that we will
teach you. Some thoughts have a certain sound… that being the equivalent
to a form. Through sound and motion you will be able to paralyze nerves,
shatter bones, set fires, suffocate an enemy or burst his organs…. We
will kill until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air.</p>
<p><strong>100 fremen</strong>: Muad’dib!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: To avenge my father, I will turn you into
killing machines.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Sayyadina. Our Reverend Mother tells me she
is too old… She has been calling through space and time for you to come
and let her rest. She asks that you pass within.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: They want me to take the Water of Life… the
Truthsayer drug… so dangerous, yet… we must move swiftly if we’re to
secure our place among these Fremen. I will try to pass within.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Death may be the result…. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: I must do this for Paul, but what of my
unborn child?</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother ramallo</strong>: So you are the ones.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Do you know the Water of Life?… Come…
…Watch… the mystery of mysteries… the end and the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: The Water of Life.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The most lethal poison in the Universe.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: … Many men have tried.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Did they try and fail?</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: They tried and died.</p>
<p><strong>monk #1</strong>: One among us has consented to enter the
rite. She will attempt to pass within that we not lose the strength of
our Reverend Mother.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What if she should fail?</p>
<p><strong>monk #1</strong>: Drink!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: The ultimate awareness spectrum narcotic. I
must transform the poison configuration within my body… the blue must be
made clean.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother ramallo</strong>: You should have told
us.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother ramallo</strong>: Great Mother! This changes
both! What have we done?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: No! This is the place where we cannot look.
The place only for the eyes of the Kwisatz Haderach.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: What is this?… Is this what kills the men
who enter here?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Now my daughter and I are both Reverend
Mothers.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother ramallo</strong>: I’ve been a long time
waiting for you. Here is my life.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: Change it that we may all drink of it.</p>
<p><strong>monk</strong>: It is changed!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She did it!</p>
<p><strong>chani</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Chani…. I love you… I’ve always loved
you….</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Feyd, even though he’s aging, Thufir is one
of the finest Mentats in the Universe… and he’s mine, Feyd… all mine….
Quiet now.</p>
<p><strong>feyd</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Oh Thufir, I see they’ve installed your heart
plug already…. Don’t be angry. Everyone gets one here. But this is not
why we’re here. We’ve brought you a little cat, Thufir. You must care
for it if you wish to live. A poison has been introduced into you,
Thufir Hawat. By milking this smooth little cat body each day you
receive your antidote… it must be done each day…. Also, you must do
something for me if you wish to live. You know I lost Piter, my dear
Mentat…</p>
<p><strong>feyd</strong>: All I can see is an Atreides that I want to
kill.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Feyd, no, no! Thufir’s a Harkonnen now,
aren’t you Thufir?</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: My dear Duke… how I have failed you.</p>
<p><strong>harah</strong>: What will you call her?</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Alia.</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: Mother.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Activate your weirding modules…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Set the range for two meters.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Korba… The arm…</p>
<p><strong>korba</strong>: Chuuk-sa…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Motion… Chuuk-sa…</p>
<p><strong>korba</strong>: Chuuuk-sa…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Stilgar…</p>
<p><strong>a fremen</strong>: Muad’dib!…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: My own name is a killing word. Will it be a
healing word as well?</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: the shoulders of several large Fremen</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Now!</p>
<p><strong>pail</strong>: They’re even better on the battlefield than in
the training rooms!! Sound… as a weapon. If only you could see them,
father.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: When the spice flow stops, the entire Universe
will turn to Arrakis. The Baron and the Emperor himself will be forced
to deal with us.</p>
<p><strong>rabban</strong>: What happened? What happened to you? What is
he saying?</p>
<p><strong>wounded harkonnen</strong>: Muad’dib!… Muad’dib!… Muad’dib!…
Muad’dib!</p>
<p><strong>a harkonnen soldier</strong>: He’s been repeating that name
ever since we found him.</p>
<p><strong>rabban</strong>: Who is this Muad’dib?</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Usul… It is time you become a sandrider…
and travel as a Fremen. Take the kiswa maker hook of our sietch and ride
as a leader of men.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Two thumpers are planted. The worm may not
surface for the first - he will rise for the second. Remember, when the
worm approaches, you must be utterly still… and close enough to plant
the hook firmly under a ring segment…. The worm will turn to lift this
exposed area as far from the abrasive sand as possible and it will take
you with it – to the top. Do not get too close as he approaches… the
sand will engulf you…. Wait till the head of the worm passes – then go…
quickly.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar &amp; fremen</strong>: Shai-Hulud… Shai-Hulud.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Only the very strong ones travel this
deep….</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Usul has called a big one. Again… it is the
legend.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A sandrider!…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Long live the fighters!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Seventeen Great Houses of the Lansraad have
reported a significant delay in delivery of spice per CHOAM agreement.
This constitutes a serious violation of CHOAM codes. Contact Baron
Vladimir Harkonnen immediately.</p>
<p><strong>rabban</strong>: Falsify the reports. We can’t hide it all,
tell them we’ve lost only two hundred harvesters… and forty carryalls…
and don’t let my uncle know about the destruction of the spice silos…. I
will catch this Muad’dib and suck the blood from him!! SUCK THE BLOOD
FROM HIM!!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We surprised a band of smugglers.</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Too bad… thought they were Harkonnen.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Gurney!…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ve no need of your weapons with me Gurney
Halleck.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Paul!! Paul!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t you trust your own eyes.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: They said you were dead. They said…</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: You young pup! You young pup!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stand-by… warning… we have just received a
coded threat from the Guild. Spice production is in serious jeopardy…
Giedi Prime supplying false reports… Guild to visit Emperor in one
standard day.</p>
<p><strong>tanked guildsman #2</strong>: Emperor Shaddam IV… You have
one last chance to take matters into your own hands and bring the
situation under the control on Arrakis.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: What do you mean one last…</p>
<p><strong>tanked guildsman #2</strong>: Do not speak!… Listen!… You do
not have more than this one chance…. I represent the entire Guild in
this matter…. You have failed to kill the Atreides heir… Paul.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: But he was said to…</p>
<p><strong>tanked guildsmen #2</strong>: Noooooo… he is not dead. He is
not eaten by worms as you have wanted to believe. He is not missing. He
is in the deep desert with the Fremen. The Spice is in great danger. We
are not asking… we are telling… remedy the situation or you will live
out your life in a pain amplifier.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Who is this Paula Atreides to the Guild?
And why?</p>
<p><strong>harah</strong>: Your Reverence, I don’t wish to upset you,
but the other women…</p>
<p><strong>harah</strong>: …they don’t like Alia around. She frightens
them. It is the strangeness of your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: It’s the way she speaks of things…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: …beyond her years and of things no child
could know – things of the past.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: A daughter who knew at birth everything I
know…</p>
<p><strong>harah</strong>: But Your Reverence, they won’t have her
around them.</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: Harah! Would they deny me the right to use
this mind?…</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: Would they deny me the right to use this
voice?…</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Alia!</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: I want fifty legions of Sardaukar on
Arrakis at once.</p>
<p><strong>sardaukar officer #1</strong>: Fifty legions?… That’s our
entire reserves as well.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: This is genocide… the deliberate and
systematic destruction of all life on Arrakis.</p>
<p><strong>chani</strong>: You were calling my name… it frightened
me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hurry! All I see is darkness.</p>
<p><strong>chani</strong>: Paul… I will love you forever… in life or in
death… let Shai-Hulud judge now. You are my life.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Now… the test of the water of life… what is it
that waits for me in this darkness?</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: Mother - help me!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Alia! What is it?</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: It’s Paul. He’s taken the Water of Life.</p>
<p><strong>chani</strong>: Paul… Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Father!… Father! THE SLEEPER HAS</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Arrakis… Dune… Desert Planet.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Your time has come. Father… our time has come.
A storm is coming – our storm… and when it comes it will shake the
Universe. Emperor… we come for you.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Long live the fighters!</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Long live the fighters!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Gurney, when the storm hits… set off the
atomics. I want an opening through the entire Shield Wall. Stilgar? Do
we have wormsign?</p>
<p><strong>stilgar</strong>: Usul… We have wormsign, the likes of which
even God has never seen.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Bring in that floating fat man… the
Baron.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Why have you brought me here?</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: Your Highness… There must be some mistake… I
never requested your presence.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Ah? But your lack of action demanded it.
Your dreadful mismanagement, your bad judgement in assigning to Rabban –
– the governorship…. You forced me to come here and set things straight…
personally.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Bring in the messenger.</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: I am the messenger from Muad’dib. Poor
Emperor, I’m afraid my brother won’t be very pleased with you.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Silence!… I do not court your brother’s
pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Kill this child!! She’s an
abomination!! Kill her. Get out of my mind!!!</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: Not until you tell them both who I really
am.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Sister of Paul Muad’dib.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Paul’s sister… Paul is Muad’dib?!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Alia keeps pace with the storm.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Gurney, now!</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Atomics!</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: My brother is coming… with many Fremen
warriors.</p>
<p><strong>sardaukar officer #2</strong>: The Shield Wall is gone.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Impossible!</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: Not impossible. I told you… He is here
now.</p>
<p><strong>sardaukar officer #2</strong>: Majesty, into the ship!</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: Release the Sardaukar. Baron… give this
little abomination to the storm.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: I have her, Majesty!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Gurney… I see Thufir Hawat among the captives.
Let him stand free.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: My Lord?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Let him stand free!</p>
<p><strong>feyd</strong>: The antidote…</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: Thufir. Come.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: A knife…. In payment of the many years of
service to my family, you may know ask of me anything you wish. Anything
at all. Do you need my life, old friend?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It is yours.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I mean this, Thufir. If you are to strike, do
it now.</p>
<p><strong>thufir</strong>: Three… generations… of you…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Carry this noble Atreides warrior away. Do him
all honor.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Emperor Shadam the IV… there are Guild
Heighliners above us containing many Great Houses of the Lansraad…. SEND
THEM</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: How dare you speak to me…</p>
<p><strong>guildsman #2</strong>: Stop your speaking!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Good. You have some idea of what I would do
but I will tell it to one who has never been seen… one who hides deep in
the Heighliner control rooms. He will hear it first.</p>
<p><strong>guildsmen #3</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where are you…. Let me see you or there will
be no spice.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You know what I’m about to say is true…. I
have the power to destroy the spice forever.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t try your powers on me. Try looking into
that place where you dare not look. You’ll find me there staring back at
you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the
one person your schemes required. Here I stand. But… I will never be
yours.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: Stop him, Jessica!</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Stop him yourself.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You saw a part of what the race needs in the
beginning. In time you perverted the truth. You sought to control human
breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan.
How little you understand.</p>
<p><strong>reverend mother</strong>: You mustn’t speak of…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember
mine. I can kill with a word.</p>
<p><strong>fedaykin #1</strong>: …and his word shall carry death eternal
to those who stand against the righteous.</p>
<p><strong>feyd</strong>: The righteous!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There is a Harkonnen among you. Give the
Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: If Feyd wishes, he can meet you with my
blade in his hand.</p>
<p><strong>feyd</strong>: I wish it.</p>
<p><strong>gurney</strong>: This is a Harkonnen animal. Let me, please,
my Lord.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The Emperor’s blade.</p>
<p><strong>feyd</strong>: Why prolong the inevitable? I will kill you! I
will kill him!</p>
<p><strong>chani</strong>: Paul!</p>
<p><strong>feyd</strong>: Who is the little one? A pet, perhaps? Will
she deserve my special attentions?</p>
<p><strong>feyd</strong>: You see… your death… my blade will finish
you.</p>
<p><strong>fedaykin #2</strong>: Usul no longer needs the weirding
module.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Now, I will tell you how it will be. Irulan
shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the
throne.</p>
<p><strong>emperor</strong>: I sit on the throne!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You will sit on a throne on Selusa Secundus,
your prison planet. Either that or you will die.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The Princess shall have no more of me than my
name… no child of mine or touch the softness of glance… nor instant of
desire…. This is my promise to you… …my love.</p>
<p><strong>jessica</strong>: Think on it Chani… We who carry the name of
concubine… history will call us wives.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The Fremen have the word of Muad’dib. They
will have their Holy War to cleanse the Universe… they will have
Arrakis… Dune… their planet. There will be flowing water here open to
the sky and rich green oases. For the spice there will always be some
desert. There will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men. We Fremen
have a saying… “God created Arrakis to train the faithful.” One cannot
go against the word of God.</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: And how can this be?</p>
<p><strong>alia</strong>: For… he is the Kwisatz Haderach!</p>
