<p><strong>man</strong>: Hi, Susan… no. Hi, Susie…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Howdee, Susan… no… Hello there, Doctor Bright.
No no no. Hello, Susan…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hello, Susan…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hello, Susan.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What god would that be?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel…</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What? No kiss? Not even for old times
sake?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: When did you…?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Been out for six months now.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Really? What have you been doing?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You know, this and that.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Still chasing litterbugs?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Somebody has to.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Same old Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oh no. Not by a long shot. I may look like
the old Daniel O’Brien, but on the inside, nothing is the same.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oh yeah. See, Susie, a man doesn’t do the
hard time and just pick up where he left off. Oh no. The big house does
things to a man.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The big house?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: The big house.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Jesus, Daniel. It wasn’t Ryker’s Island. It
was work camp for white collar criminals.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: A cage by any other name would still smell
like sweaty ugly men.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You know, I’ve been following your work at
Argon Labs.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I’ve been thinking about you a lot all
these years, locked up in my cell. I’d tear through every issue of the
Midwest Science Journal looking for your latest findings, watching as
you slowly worked your polymerization experiments up through single
celled organisms to that holiest of holies, the fruit fly. Exciting
stuff. I got to tell you, it really kept me going.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I guess I should be flattered.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I remember you said, nanotechnology was
going to change the world.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It already is.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I’ve read they’re using it to repair cancer
cells.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: And for cleaning up oil spills.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Right. You predicted it.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Do you ever wonder what happened to us,
Susie?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It was a long time ago, Daniel. We were
young, different people, heading in different directions. That’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I
have to be going.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Sure. Can I ask you one more thing? You
haven’t published anything in a while. How come?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Nothing really worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: That’s what I thought.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Be seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Icarus?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Icarus, I thought I would find you here.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: You never came to bed.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Have you been here all night?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: How are you feeling today?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: I feel like I felt yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Like rotting meat.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: You’re not rotting meat.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Oh no? Smell this.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Icarus, please, if you want me to give you a
bath just say so.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: No. I’m getting used to it.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Fine. Now I need your signature on this
today.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: What about Dr. Bright?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: She’s working as fast as she can, Icarus. It
will be ready soon.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: It’s ready now, I know it is.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: She says it’s not.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: She’s lying. She lost the first one on
purpose.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: She did not. The mouse ran down the
drain.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: She let it escape because she wants me to
die.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Don’t be a child, Icarus. She is just another
scientist and like all scientists, she doesn’t care about anything
outside the world of the laboratory.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Right now she is still concerned about the
unstable molecular waste generated by the first experiment. I am sure
that when she solves that problem she will be ready for the second
test.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Now you be a good boy today and take your
medicine and Poppy will make you forget about everything tonight.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Something wrong, Dr. Bright?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I can’t find my key card.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Not a problem. Just let us know if it’s lost
and we’ll make you a new one.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Without the nanobot it appears there will
be no way to stabilize the waste entirely. Even at subzero temperatures
it remains active.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: I wonder if there is a way we could catch
that mouse. Susan? Susan, are you listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What? Oh, I’m sorry, Nigel. I was just
thinking…</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Aaabout…?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: This morning. I saw someone I haven’t seen in
a long time.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: A man?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah. I knew him when I was still in
school.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m not sure. That’s the funny thing about
him. He’s the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he
might do to get it.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Litterbug.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Hey! Hey, you! Hey, litterbug!
Mr. Litterbug!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Excuse me, but I believe you dropped
this.</p>
<p><strong>litterbug</strong>: Yeah? So what?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: So what? So what? For starters, how about
littering is a crime.</p>
<p><strong>litterbug</strong>: Haw-haw! Why don’t you run off and find a
cop and I’ll wait right here.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Why don’t you just put this in your pocket
so when you see a garbage can you can put it where it belongs.</p>
<p><strong>litterbug</strong>: Why don’t you just shove it up your ass!
Haw-haw!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What is it with you litterbugs? Is it a
territorial thing, marking your turf with your garbage?</p>
<p><strong>litterbug</strong>: You better quit pushing me, pal.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I just want to know what goes on in the
mind of a litterbug. What chemical is secreted by your smooth brain that
tells you, ‘It’s okay, just chuck it’?</p>
<p><strong>litterbug</strong>: Look, asshole, I don’t got time for this.
If you got a problem, you better take care of it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oh no, no, no. No can do. You enjoyed a
tasty beverage and thus this receptacle becomes your responsibility and
I don’t care if it’s a Styrofoam cup or the Exxon Valdez! You’ve got to
learn to take responsibility!</p>
<p><strong>litterbug</strong>: What are you going to do? Make me throw
it out?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I’ll do whatever I have to do.</p>
<p><strong>litterbug</strong>: Jee-sus! You’re crazy as catshit! You
win. Gimme the cup.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Believe me, later on you’ll feel a lot
better about this…</p>
<p><strong>litterbug</strong>: Later on you’re going to feel a whole lot
worse! Haw-haw.</p>
<p><strong>litterbug</strong>: Next time mind your own business!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: No good stinking litterbug…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Do you remember about five years ago, that
uh… incident at Purnell Labs?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Oh yeah. They were working on molecular
assemblers, too, weren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the
bonding element.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: That’s right. C.D.C. found out and closed
them down…</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the
samples, one of those animal rights groups, right? I remember now, they
freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts
Turnpike, right?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yeah. But it wasn’t a group. It was one
man.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: That’s the guy?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: And you think he knows what we’re doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: So you think this psycho- environmentalist
character stole your security key to break into the lab?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It might be paranoia, but I’ve never lost my
keycard before.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: ‘Paranoia is what separates the secured from
the unsecured.’</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Just a little saying we’ve got in the security
business, Dr. Bright. We get paid to be paranoid. We worry so you don’t
have to.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: A lot of people think security is just a job,
but for me it’s a way of life. It’s a state of mind.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: If this nutcase did take it and has half a
brain, he’d use it right away, before we could invalidate it.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yes, that is what I was thinking.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: In fact, would it be safe to say, based on your
general knowledge of this character, that he is already in the
building?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yes, he might be.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Susan! Susan!</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: What did security say?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: They’ll in validate the key. Probably
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Well, you got another problem.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The replicators?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Worse. Mrs. Argon wants to talk to you.
She’s waiting in the lab.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: This day just keeps going from bad to
worse.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Vermin…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: I spoke to Dr. Argon this morning and he
remains frustrated over the loss of the original nanobot.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I am aware of Dr. Argon’s frustrations.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: He believes that the second nanobot should be
ready for testing by now.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Dr. Argon is going to have to muster a little
patience. I was rushed into testing the nanobot on that mouse and now we
are dealing with a toxic waste that has the potential to make Three Mile
Island look like spilled milk.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Under the circumstances, I can’t fathom what
makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger. If C.N.N., or
hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement –</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Is that a threat, Dr. Bright?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Look, as I have said and will continue to
say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority –</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: While you remain on the staff at Argon
Laboratories, your priorities will always be the same as Dr. Argon’s
priorities. I imagine that is a simple enough equation for a bright girl
like you to figure out.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: If you don’t have any questions, I’ll let you
get back to doing your job.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Just one question. Since Dr. Argon no longer
has feeling below his waist, how is it that you’re still able to do your
job?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: I could have you fired right now.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You won’t. That’s why you’re whispering.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: He wants another test?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: I bet he hasn’t read a single report
we’ve written on the waste problem.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I hope you’re right. I’d feel a lot worse if
he had read them and just didn’t care.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What I’ve always done. As long as I’m the
only one who can build the nanobot, I’m the only one who can say when it
should be tested.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Hey, Dobe… Ever wonder if this is how God feels
looking down on us?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Yeah, me neither.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oh no, P.O.W.s.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Never leave a man behind.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Looked like a… mouse.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Never good at remembering numbers, were
you, Susie?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: That’s your baby, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Look what we caught here.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: One big muther of a mouse.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: I’ve been waiting for something like this my
whole life.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Bad boy got caught with his hand in the
cookie jar.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: You should have stayed in jail, pal.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: For every environmentalist, anti-
industrialist, animal activist that has shoved their myopic,
protectionist cause-of-the-month crap down my throat, I shove this down
yours!</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: You sure you know what you’re doing,
Icky?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Nanotechnology is going to change the world,
Danny. I’m telling you in ten maybe twenty years, life is going to be a
totally new kind of experience.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: And what I love about molecular science is
the way it revolutionizes how we have to think. It unifies the entire
world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I
can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole.
It’s really wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Yeah, we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We’ll see? What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: We’ll see how wonderful it is after you
spend the next twenty years making Agent Orange.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: God, Daniel, I’m not going to make Agent
Orange.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You think the chemists that invented Agent
Orange twenty years ago were in school saying, ‘Boy, I really got some
good ideas for a highly toxic incendiary defoliant.’ You think
Oppenheimer was dreaming about mushroom clouds before the war?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We’ve had this conversation already,
Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: All I’m saying is that the companies that
have money for the kind of research you’re interested in, have money
because that’s what they’re interested in! Money!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m sorry I brought the whole thing up! If
you’re gonna flip your wig –</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I can’t help it, Suze. It’s this place. You
know how I get in these stores. They freak me out. All these tiny boxes,
little cans filled with eight syllable God knows what.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Look at this. They’ve taken all the food
out of food. When you start talking about the future, this is what I
see. Huge vats of Spam. You are what you eat and they’re turning us into
Spam-people.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You think it’s a coincidence that they have
all these aisles lined up like this, like a little maze! We’re all lab
rats running through their maze, pulling lever A or lever B, each
designed to create some kind of bio-chemical dependency. All the while
they’re everywhere, watching us, two-way mirrors, surveillance cameras,
nodding to each other, making little notes.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re insane.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Am I? Look! Right there! That’s exactly
what I am talking about.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Lever A…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel! Don’t – Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Let me help you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You don’t want this.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yeah, I do!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You have no idea what this is doing to your
body.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I like Trix!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel, give him the Trix.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Susan, this is the future of America
here.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Trix are for kids!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Here, kid, this is great stuff. Why don’t
you give it a try?</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I want Trix! Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Icky, this is so exciting.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: How long do you leave him in there?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Until he’s done.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: … Icky?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: My God… it works.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Grab him! Hurry! Grab him!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: That’s impossible.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: It’s a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: It’s an organic-polymerization.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Icky! What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Who cares! We’ve got to find him! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Ah for the love of God, I ain’t going in
there.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: You check it out.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: It works, Poppy. It works, it works!</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Now, Icky, I don’t need you winding yourself
up. I need you focused and in control.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: But, Poppy, you don’t know what this means
–</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: You don’t either. We won’t know anything
until we find that guy and find out if he’s alive or what.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Yes, that’s true. We have to find him, run
tests, determine if the polymerization is stable.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: In the meantime, we’re going to need someone
to deal with that mess in the lab. I don’t think we should call
Dr. Bright.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Oh no. No. We’ll get her assistant.
What’s-his-name? Nebbishman?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Nebbleman.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Dr. Nebbleman, thank God you’re here!</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: I’ve been nearly hysterical with fright.
Thank God you came. I feel so much better that you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: As I told you on the phone, there’s been an
accident. A terrible accident.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Okay. Alright. Okey-dokey. Now, we need
the nanobot. The nanobot that initiated the reaction. Once we have that
we can stabilize the meltdown. Simple really. No problem.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: The nanobot is gone.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Gone? What do you mean gone? Gone
where?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Dr. Nebbleman, we are scientists, you and I
and men of science are not concerned with emotions and opinions. We are
concerned with facts.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: The fact is, that the milk has been spilled
and now we need you to tell us how to clean it up.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Cleaned up? It can’t be cleaned up!
Without the nanobot the waste can’t be stabilized! That’s what we’ve
been trying to tell you! The only thing we can do is run! Run! Run!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Facts, Dr. Nebbleman. Facts. You’ve been
using cryogenics to control the waste from the mouse experiment, haven’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Well, yes. The replicators are not as
active at low temperatures.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Then perhaps we can use liquid nitrogen to
keep the meltdown under control.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: That might work.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Poppy, order the trucks from the Gary plant.
And we’re going to need a containment crew.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: A containment crew is going to attract a lot
of attention.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: You’re right. Place a call to our friends at
the network and to Mr. Joplin at the E.P.A.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: How did this happen? How did the nanobot
activate the assembler fluid? If I’m going to help, I have to know what
happened.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: All right, Dr. Nebbleman. Come with me and
I’ll tell you everything.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Mr. Sim, did you find him?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: No, but if he’s alive I think I know where he
might go.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Oh God, it’s worse than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Get that crew in here. Now!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Uh oh.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Good morning, Mr. O’Brien!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You! I remember you!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: I’m real touched. Now get your Sunday’s on.
We’re going for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What? I’m not going anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Oh yes you are!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I get it. You’re the goon fetch boy. The
zookeeper Argon calls in when one of his guinea pigs gets loose.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Only this ain’t no tranquilizer gun. Now let’s
go!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Forget it, pissboy! You tell Argon he can
call my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: The hard way it is!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Not smart! You forgot I’ve got the gun!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Then let’s see you use it, bucko!
Dr. Argon’s not going to take it very well that you killed his
experiment.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Okay. Okay. Doby?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Help! Somebody help me!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: I’ll take care of this. Hold him.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Lights out.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: I said – Lights out!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Ouchhh! Cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Get his legs.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Holy shit!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oh God – am I dead?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: This is going to take some explaining.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Mrs. Argon? It’s Sim.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Mr. Sim? Do you have him? He’s alive?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Oh yeah, he’s alive. Technically.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: And you have him?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: We lost him.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Here, you tell him.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Mr. Sim, you know I sooner kill the messenger
then listen to bad news.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Don’t worry there, Dr. Argon. He gave us the
slip, in a manner of speaking. But we’re definitely closing in on
him.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Mr. Sim, when you do locate him. Do not scare
him off again. Just watch him. I think you can handle that. Right,
Mr. Sim?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: You got it, Dr. Argon.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Tawney, I’m standing in front of the
security station just outside of Argon Labs in Calumet City. Since seven
o’clock this morning, when security guards barred the weekend staff here
at Argon Labs, rumors have been circulating as to the nature of the
accident that occurred here last night.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: All we know for sure is that at 9:30 a.m.,
two sedans carrying the county sheriff and men who have been identified
as high-ranking officials of the E.P.A. entered the Argon offices and
have not come out.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: We expect a statement some time today, but
until then we can only speculate that whatever did happen here, which
has crews working around the clock, no one was prepared for. This has
been Spencer Lamm live at Argon Labs.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh shit…</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Susie! You gotta help me!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Please, Susan! I need help! Something is
wrong with me!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Sorry, Daniel, I’m a physicist, not a
psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: No, something is really wrong… look!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You… you…</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: They did it to me!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The nanobot.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Last night, Argon’s goons grabbed me, the
big one hit me, probably did severe cranio-sacral damage and bam, I drop
to the floor, and then Argon was there, and it became like a bad dream.
Everyone was laughing as he stuck this big needle in my neck and then
I’m not sure what happened but I came to in a metal tank and they
drowned me with white goo and I thought I was dead, everything soft and
blurry and the next thing I know I wake up back in my hotel and Argon’s
goons bust in and we fight and I fall out the window and again I thought
I was a goner, but I hit the ground and I bounce and I look up and my
arm is really really long and I know, I know I shouldn’t have been in
your lab but Jesus Christ, Susan, feel my skin, feel it! It feels like
plastic!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: … just like the mouse.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Mouse? What mouse?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: My first organic-polymerization was a lab
mouse.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What happened to it?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It escaped from the lab before we could
finish the experiment.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: But you’ve polymerized single-celled
bacteria and the fruit flies, I know you have.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Then you must have at some point tried to
reverse the procedure.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oh no, no, no! You’ve got to be able to fix
me! Please, Susan, tell me you can make me normal again!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Once the subject was polymerized we were
unable to reassemble the original organic structure.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oh God, please! This can’t be happening! I
can’t be plastic! A plastic man?!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I’m a plastic man! A plastic man!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: We don’t have time for hysterics.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: We don’t?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What has happened to you is nothing compared
to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don’t hurry.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What are these?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The nanobot is still inside you. It’s
programmed to exit through the urinary tract. We need it as soon as
possible, so swallow those.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Pills… you know how I feel about pills.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: If you don’t want to do it this way, I can
remove it surgically.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Why do we need it?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The nanobot is the only thing that can
stabilize the waste.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What waste?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Well, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like it. We can’t
get a handle on it.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a
microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger
R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the
polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic
system on a molecular level.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: That was ‘simple’?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The nanobot combined your molecules with the
plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular
level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human
being.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The problem is the by-product created by the
process.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: The waste.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Only part of the molecule from the assembler
fluid bonds to your molecules. The part left over is a highly charged
unstable molecule we call a replicator.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The effect these replicators have on any
matter, organic or inorganic, is similar to the molecular deterioration
caused by nuclear radiation.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’ve been measuring the levels of
deterioration. As with radiation, the more exposure, the more damage it
does.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I dropped a single replicator in with this
egg two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: It’s polymerized like me?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The replicators start off like assemblers,
but the replicators never stabilize.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What happens?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: That was an egg?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Three days ago it was.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What do these replicators do to people?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: With enough exposure, the same thing they do
to everything else.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Here in Calumet City, a bomb has just
dropped. Through anonymous sources, we have learned that Argon Labs may
have been the victim of an attack by a radical environmentalist group.
No such group has yet to claim responsibility but we are expecting
confirmation of these rumors at a press conference scheduled this
afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: So right now there’s little replicators
spreading throughout Argon’s lab?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Isn’t it already too late then?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: There is a forty-eight hour period during
which the waste can be stabilized.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The nanobot will start a chain reaction and
transform the replicators through a double hydrogen bond, creating an
ionic solid instead of a polymer.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Yet another miracle of modern science.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I think while we’re waiting, we had better
run some basic diagnostics on you.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You’re the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Now we wait.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Darn good cone.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Breathe deep.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Lungs sound fine. You didn’t have any
pre-existing physical conditions, did you? Allergies? Infections?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: No, why?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: My theory is that during the polymerization
the nanobot should correct any malformed or defective molecules.
Open.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: That theory is the reason Argon has been
pushing me to test the second nanobot. He believes it’s the only thing
that will save him.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’d like to run a few sample blood tests to
get an idea of how stable your condition is.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Okay. Sure. You’re the doc.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Hold still.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Amazing.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: No, no, I just feel wired!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s probably the caffeine.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Whoa! Whoa! I gotta go! Right now!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Ahhh…</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Susan!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Look at this!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What about it!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Just look at it!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The polymerization probably synthesized into
a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate. So what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: That’s not biodegradable.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oh yeah, real funny. Yuk-yuk. Let’s laugh
at everything a man believes in.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it’s
pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever
polymerized. It’s got to mean something.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Means? Oh no. We won’t know what it means
until the end of the story and maybe then it won’t seem quite as funny
to you, Doctor Frankenstein!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Just giving credit where credit is due.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You have no one to blame but yourself.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Blame the victim.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Victim my ass! You stole my security key and
used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage! Maybe
this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: This is what I deserve for trying to
protect the world from a madman and his mercenary physicists?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re not protecting the world, you’re
obstructing progress!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I don’t consider uncontrollable toxic waste
progress!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: And I’m sure you thought Columbus was going
to sail off the edge of the world!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: But lo and behold he found another world
that progress could annihilate!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Come on, I don’t see you living in a
cave!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: And I don’t see you sunbathing at
Chernobyl!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Just like old times.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Yeah. Old times.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I want you to know that I really appreciate
you helping me.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m glad you came to me for help.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I feel very emotional right now. A bit out
of control.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Probably the caffeine.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Do you have something to bring me down?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: The nanobot is a molecular machine. It
uses the assembler fluid to polymerize a whole system of carbon- based
molecules as in, say, a human body.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Once it’s complete, the waste from the
assembler fluid is left destabilized with groups of highly charged
attractors capable of bonding to any carbon molecule exposed for a long
enough period.</p>
<p><strong>joplin</strong>: Hold on, son. Are you saying that they can
bond to people?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: With enough exposure, it appears they can
bond to anything.</p>
<p><strong>joplin</strong>: Well, what will they do to people?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Well, at this time, I mean that is to
say, it is difficult to project –</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Look, John, nobody wants to find out what
happens. That’s why you’re here. We need your help on this one and
that’s why that suitcase is here.</p>
<p><strong>joplin</strong>: Let me assure you, Dr. Argon, the E.P.A. is,
as always, on your side.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: … food.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Come on, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Hey, Susie! I’m hungry!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Uh oh. I remember that temper.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel, I didn’t hear you come down…</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The nanobot… it’s not here…</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: It’s still inside me?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’ll have to start drinking fluids, lots of
fluids.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: How far can you stretch?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Go ahead. Reach as high as you can.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: That’s why I love the security biz. Just when
you think you’ve seen everything…</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oops.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I’ll end up back in jail for indecent
exposure.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: That should do it.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I’m going to go out for a while. I want to
take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What did you want my hair for?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Something else I want to try.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I could go with you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I think it would be better for me to go
alone. I’m sure Sim is looking for you. Just sit tight. I’ll bring you
back a pizza.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: No cheese.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I was hoping you were over that. Remember to
keep drinking fluids.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Positively paradoxical.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Technically, I don’t even have to ‘go’ to
the bathroom…</p>
<p><strong>joplin</strong>: Good afternoon. The intent of…</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>joplin</strong>: Oh. I’m John Joplin, special investigator
for the E.P.A. The intent of this press conference is twofold. Number
one, to affirm that there has been a slight chemical spill at Argon
Labs. Cleanup is already under way.</p>
<p><strong>joplin</strong>: And number two, that the E.P.A. in
conjunction with members of Illinois County Sheriff Department and the
F.B.I. have concluded that the spill was not accidental.</p>
<p><strong>joplin</strong>: Last night, Argon Labs was the target of
what can only be described as a terrorist act.</p>
<p><strong>joplin</strong>: The single assailant sabotaged certain
chemical storage units, creating the toxic spill.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Are there any suspects?</p>
<p><strong>joplin</strong>: The only thing I can say is that the
perpetrator was photographed by Argon Security cameras. The rest of the
details of the case, until a later time, will be kept in the highest
confidentiality. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>joplin</strong>: Oh, yeah. His name’s Daniel O’Brien.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Mrs. Argon, do you have anything to say to
this O’Brien character?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: All I can say is that when these radicals act
outside the law, recklessly endangering the environment and human lives,
it clearly demonstrates that they are the menace and we are the
victims.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Surprise!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: That’s pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Getting used to it.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Don’t worry, I got just what you need.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I have a friend at a textile lab. She helped
me.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Ta-da!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s a crime fighting costume, what do you
think? It’s underwear, so if you lose your clothes you’ll still be
decent.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: That’s going to fit me?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Like a glove.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You made this out of my hair?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Sort of. We used a process similar to the
vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene
elastomers.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I bet you still kill at Scrabble.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Go on, try it on. Oh wait…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: There was some extra, so I made these.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Cute.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Did you go?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: On the counter.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Groovy.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: ‘In brightest day, nor darkest night. No
evil shall escape my sight.’</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wertham</strong>: … an extremely volatile individual
given to emotional outbursts.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Wertham? That’s no good.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: The head shrinker at the prison.</p>
<p><strong>dr. wertham</strong>: … paranoid delusions and prone to hero
fantasies all of which are characteristic of a form of infantile
dementia.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Ha! What a crock. He couldn’t be more
wrong, could he?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I said, could he?</p>
<p><strong>tawney</strong>: Once again, at this time, authorities
continue their statewide manhunt for the man believed responsible for
the situation developing at Argon Labs. As reports come in, News Center
5 will continue to update you.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh no. They’re trying to blame you for the
accident. That means they must not have been able to control the
replicators.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I can’t go back to jail. I gotta get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re not going back to jail. All we need to
do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal
with Argon –</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What in the hell?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Pipe down, brain lady! And you…</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: I’d curb that monkey business, lessin’ you want
to find out if that rubber skin of yours is bulletproof. Now, keep your
hands where I can see them.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Lemonade. Do you want some?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Put it down and let’s go. Someone wants to talk
to you.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: My apologies to you both for the rather rude
invitation but I had to see you. And, Dr. Bright, your house isn’t…</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Wheelchair accessible.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I can explain it. Attempted murder wasn’t
enough for him. He wants to add kidnapping to the charges.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: If you’d like, we can go straight to the
authorities. I understand they are very interested in talking to
you.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: We haven’t been properly introduced,
Mr. O’Brien. I am Icarus Argon.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Do you know how I made my first fortune? Poly
vinyl chloride. P.V.C. It was almost thirty years ago when I first held
a credit card in my hands. There was something about the way it felt. I
told myself, paper was doomed. This was the future…</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: … plastic.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Wow, that is one moving story. Take it easy
on my heart strings. Now I really feel guilty complaining about you
shooting me up with your poison.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Poison? I’m surprised at you. You lack
vision, Mr. O’Brien.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You’re lacking a few things too: ethics,
morals, common decency and, oh yeah, deodorant.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Look at me, Mr. O’Brien. I once competed for
Mr. Universe but now I am reduced to this, a withered shell. A prison of
rot.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: People ask me what I did to myself. I answer,
what didn’t I do?! I treat me body like I treat the rest of the world,
as a force to be controlled. Most people believe there is something
sacred about the human body, about nature. They are the same fools who
thought the world was flat.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: The body is just another part of nature and
ever since we gave up trees for central air, there has been nothing
sacred about nature. Nature is the enemy, Mr. O’Brien, and science is
our greatest weapon against her.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You egomaniacs make me laugh. Nature’s
going to bury you like she buries everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Not anymore, Mr. O’Brien. The nanobot has
changed that.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: If you think I would ever give you the
nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: You don’t have to give it to us because
Dr. Nebbleman can just cut it out of him.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Ha! Morons. It’s not even in me
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: She could have given him something to
stimulate his kidneys.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Dr. Nebbleman, take care of them.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Mr. Sim I want you to return to Dr. Bright’s.
I believe she is hiding something of ours there.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel, do something!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel, go! I’ll be all right! Get the
nanobot!</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Where did he go?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: The trunk.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Ott, shake him!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Here goes nothing.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: It’s Sim. We’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Mr. Sim, watch out! O’Brien escaped and
could be on his way!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: You want to tell me what I’m looking for?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: I’ve only been invited to her house once,
but I know there is a basement lab that she uses for private
research.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You were never invited to my house.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: You’re looking for a urine sample.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: The fluid should be murky yellow in color
and extremely viscous.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Wait a minute. This ain’t no lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: What’s it smell like?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Smell? Uh, something like
methylcyanoacrylate.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Like Crazy Glue?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Yes. That’s it. He’s got it. Oh God, he’s
got it!</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Gently, Ott. Gently.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the
nanobot arrives. The instant, understand?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Of course, sir.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot
on yourself, but you mustn’t. The situation is critical right now. The
replicators are growing exponentially. If we wait much longer it will be
too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Dr. Bright, I don’t have to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: But in another twenty-four hours the core
meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period. There will be no way
to stop it.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as
long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O’Brien, I
don’t give a rat’s ass about what happens after that.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You can’t mean that.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Come with me, Susan. I want to show you
something.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Something to drink, Dr. Bright?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: You’ll forgive me but all the excitement has
left me extremely parched. Poppy?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: A monument to my past. I much prefer the
future. Come.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: This is my garden. Few people have seen it
because it means so much to me. I am hoping as a fellow scientist you
can appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Gardener?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Would you excuse us?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Every species, every organism is the only one
of its kind, created through cross-breeding or chemical and radioactive
mutation as well as genetic manipulation.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: I spend more time here than anywhere else,
nurturing them, treating them, because they all require very special
care.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Poppy calls them my children and I suppose
that’s how I feel. That I have given birth to all of them, and there is
nothing as precious or as beautiful as one’s own children.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: We will always love most that which we
create. Don’t you agree, Susan?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic
bomb?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: More than he would ever admit. His child
changed the world. What could make a parent more proud than that?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: I brought you up here, Dr. Bright, because I
want you to understand that we are on the path. The only difference is
that you are walking with your head down, afraid to look up, to see
where the path is going.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I suppose you are going to tell me where it
is going.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: I ask you what is the purpose of science?
What is the point of all our relentless exploration, investigation and
experimentation? It is to understand a single physical phenomenon, or to
understand them all? To cure one disease, or to cure every disease? If
science is simply a means, what then is the end?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Look up. Look above you, Susan, and tell me
what you see.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Pollution?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Do you know what I see? I see man making his
own clouds. I see man coloring his own sky, and like this garden it is a
site that makes my heart sing.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: This is our world, Susan, and once you
realize that, you will understand that the only place our path can end
is on the throne of heaven. Science is the quest for divine
perfection.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: How do you know we’re not heading in the
wrong direction?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: I look behind us, I look to the past, to a
world steeped in rot and decay. I think of the Acropolis in another
century reduced to little more than dust. I see the faces of Rushmore
eventually losing all distinction, and then I look at this…</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: And I imagine it in a thousand years as
perfectly shaped as the day it was made.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: I find that thought exceptionally
reassuring.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: They’re here! They’re here! We have the
nanobot.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Excellent. How long until the assembler tank
is complete?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Dr. Makeo is working on it now, sir. I
estimate at least another six hours.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: In the meantime, why don’t you find something
useful for Dr. Bright to do.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I swear to you, Argon, if you don’t stop the
meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Susan, I sense you are having difficulty
understanding the situation you are presently in. I ask that you keep in
mind that I am ready to reduce an entire city to gelatin to get what I
want.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: If I were you, I’d be careful about making
promises that you will be unable to keep.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: Who are we supposed to be looking for?</p>
<p><strong>guard #2</strong>: Some guy in red underwear.</p>
<p><strong>guard #1</strong>: How are we supposed to know the color of
his underwear?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: These samples were taken from the
surrounding area. All the pertinent information is on disk.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: What we need to know is expansion rates,
how soon the replicators will reach the edge of the compound.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I don’t believe this is happening…</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Susan, Dr. Argon is giving you an
opportunity here.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Opportunity?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: There’s a guard outside my door! I’m a
prisoner, Nigel! Do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Dr. Argon would say we are all
prisoners.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Argon is a lunatic! I can’t believe I was
stupid enough to believe I could control him. You heard what he said,
Nigel. He doesn’t care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O. How
can that not affect you?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Because I am a new man, Susan. I am a man
of vision. Your problem, Susan, is that you’re always looking down. If
you’d just look up you’d see the big picture and in the big picture men
of vision do not dwell on what might be lost. They focus on what can be
gained.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Is that what Argon told you?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: No! Well, not those exact words.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Nigel, can’t you see he’s using you?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Of course he is, but at least there isn’t
a security guard outside my door.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re afraid of him.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Who isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel O’Brien.</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: Hey, you!</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: I’m not interested in being a hero,
Susan. I’m not interested in self- delusion and romantic sentiment.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: I’m a scientist. I have lived my whole
life by the diagnostic application of fact and the fact is, Argon is
going to get whatever he wants, so if I were you, I’d give it to
him.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You mean the designs for the nanobot? You
think after this I’m going to give them to him?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: I think that either you’re going to give
them to him or he’s going to make you give them to him.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Make me? How? You think he’s going to torture
me?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: I would.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Get out. Get out now before I hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Do you think she will give us the
designs?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Eventually. These things are always a matter
of leverage.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: And you think O’Brien is that leverage?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: That remains to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: And you still believe he’s going to come
here?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Based on what we know of him, that would seem
inevitable.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Do you think she loves him?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: She must feel something for him. After all,
she and I did create him.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Do you think she loves him like I love
you?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Poppy, are you in one of your moods
again?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: No, Icky, this is real.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: I’ve been thinking a lot since this all
started. Thinking about us.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: You know how I feel about you. You know how
much I need you. How much I trust you. I would do anything for you.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Why are there two ottomans?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Icarus, please! This is important!</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Look at me, Icarus! Look at my body. I’ve
done everything, changed anything you asked me to. ‘We will always love
most that which we create.’ Is that still true?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Yes. Yes, of course it is.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Then you still love me?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Poppy, please, just tell me what you
want.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: I want to know what will happen if the
nanobot works on you become like O’Brien, a plastic man. What will
happen to me?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: You want to be polymerized?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Plastic means forever, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: That it does, my dear. That it does.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Icarus?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: I promise, my dear, I will give the matter
some consideration.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Consideration?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: If you honestly trust me, then you’ll have to
trust me.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Ubi… Ubiqu… Ubiqu…</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Ubiquitous. Present, or seeming to be present,
everywhere at the same time; omnipresent.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: I like that.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Susan!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I don’t believe it. You’re here! Oh thank
God.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You didn’t think I could just leave
you?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I didn’t know what was going to happen. I was
just so worried something was going to happen to you.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What could happen? I’m the plastic man,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh no! Argon! We have to stop him before he
uses the nanobot! We have to get the nanobot!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Argon’s private lab.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Wait. There’s a guard.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: He’ll never know what hit him.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Savior-faire is everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: I am Mr. Ubiquitous, ain’t I O’Brien?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: You know what ubiquitous means, don’t you? It
means here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Welcome to my home, Mr. O’Brien. As you can
see we’ve been expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: This is wonderfully accommodating of you
all. Now I won’t have to come looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: You were looking for us?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Yeah, I have something I’ve been meaning to
give you.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Yeah, and what might that be?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: An ass-beating. Would you like yours first,
Mr. Sim?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Just try it! Come on! Do something. Move.
Anything. Anything! Just twitch, blink, I dare you! I double dare
you!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: That’s disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I should kill you right now for what you
did to me!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Maybe you should, but you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Run, Daniel! Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I’m not leaving without you, Susan!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: You don’t have to leave, Mr. O’Brien. We’ve
prepared a wonderful room for you. I think you’ll find it quite
comfortable, so comfortable, in fact, I doubt you’ll ever want to
leave.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Gardener!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Nooo!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What are you going to do to him?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Do? Well, I suppose that depends on you.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: … Susa…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: What did you use?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: A light mixture of oxygen, dioxide, and
sodium pentothal. He’ll sleep, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I give you the design, you let us both go.
That’s the deal.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: … it’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: You know why I hate smart women?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: They’re always thinking but you never know what
they’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Why’d she do that?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: All right, Argon. You want a fight, you got
one.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Can you feel it, Poppy? The presence of the
moment? Can you feel the weight of its significance?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Oh yes, Icky. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: This is what my entire life has been directed
at, this moment, this threshold.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Okay, arms up, lean forward.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: I stand on the verge of man’s greatest
triumph over the forces of nature!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Gently, gently. My metamorphosis will be more
than a simple transformation.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: It will be an ascension.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: I’m so excited, Icarus.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: I was wondering if you’d finished
considering?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Considering what?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: What I asked you earlier?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Poppy, please –</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: If you loved me like I loved you?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Poppy, this is not the time!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>makeo</strong>: We are ready for you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Dr. Bright. This isn’t doing anyone any
good.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: This ain’t very cooperative behavior! I’m going
to tell Dr. Argon that you ain’t cooperating!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Come on! We know you’re in there!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Break it down.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Come on, come on…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Holy shit! Jumper!</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Get this! Get this!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’ll work. It’s got to. It’s got to.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: There’s a logical explanation. Has to
be.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Oh shit. Where’s Argon?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Of course you understand, Dr. Argon, that
once the nanobot is inside of you, there is no going back –</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Shut up and do it!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: This is insane.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: No! I’ll do it myself!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Come on, O’Brien –</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Just one more…</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: I can’t stand it! How much longer?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Five, four, three, two – Drain it!</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: It’s working, it’s working.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>crew #1</strong>: Hey! Hold it! Stop!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Nuts.</p>
<p><strong>crew #2</strong>: Lady, you’re in serious trouble!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: It’s fantastic to be plastic!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Holy…</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Exactly right, Mr. Sim. You have entered one
of the holiest places on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: This lab shall forever be consecrated ground
and you, Mr. Sim, stand here a witness to man’s ultimate triumph: the
polymerization of human flesh!</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Sir, please try to hold still.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: So, I guess it worked.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: ‘Worked’? ‘Worked’?!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: A watch works, Mr. Sim. A bureaucrat works.
What transpired here cannot be measured by the word ‘work.’</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: What you see before you is the culmination of
evolution. The realization of the one driving desire at the heart of all
great human endeavors; the desire for immortality! The polymerization of
human flesh is no mere molecular transmutation, no simple scientific
procedure; it is nothing short of a miracle! A miracle that marks the
ascension of man from the finite to the infinite! From the transient to
the everlasting!</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Oh, Icky…</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Look, I don’t mean to rain on everyone’s
ascension here, but we got a little problem.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Speak.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Dr. Bright has escaped.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: If you let her reach those reporters outside
the main gate, Mr. Sim –</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: … gurk… understood.</p>
<p><strong>crew #3</strong>: The whole west wing is gone, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>crew #4</strong>: It’s in the phone lines –</p>
<p><strong>crew #5</strong>: It’s spreading to the underground pipes
–</p>
<p><strong>crew #6</strong>: We gotta get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Hey! Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Excellent work, Dr. Nebbleman. You have
outdone yourself.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Oh, Icky, you know what latex does to me…</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Enter.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Dr. Argon, everything’s starting to come apart
here. You hired me to take care of these matters of security and I am
trying, but elements are making my job impossible.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Have you found Dr. Bright?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: No. The captain of the containment crew is
closing down the main lab. He says the area has got to be evacuated.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: He’s probably right, sir, the building is
probably going to collapse under its own weight.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: And if we evacuate, what do you want to do with
O’Brien?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: It’ll be better for us if he simply
disappears. The gardener will know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Wait, wait, can I at least have his
body?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Donated to science. Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Can I ask you something? Do you ever take that
mask off?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Doesn’t it get hot?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Sorry, pal. Check out time. Moral of story;
next life, mind your own business.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Even a plastic man’s gotta breathe, eh,
Doc?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: What are you doing here? You’re supposed to be
looking for the woman.</p>
<p><strong>crewman</strong>: We found her.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: What? Did you say you found her?</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Susan!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Wellie well, Dr. Bright. You’re just in
time.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Nooo!</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Uh-oh.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Here we go again, eh, O’Brien? I got the gun, I
got the girl. All you got is some rubber underwear!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I’ve been thinking about you, Mr. Sim.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: All the different ways that I could kill
you.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: Maybe you’re ready to find out if that hide of
yours is bulletproof?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: The question is, are you?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Because once you pull the trigger, if that
bullet doesn’t kill me, we both know, you’re a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>sim</strong>: I ain’t afraid of no plastic man.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Do you know the best thing about having you
as an assistant, Nigel?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Was knowing that if you ever pissed me off, I
could always kick your ass.</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: Ohhh…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Not this time, pal!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Let’s see how you like it.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Did you think I could just leave you…?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Susie… I…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You don’t have to say anything, Daniel. I’m a
scientist. I know what’s happening. I recognize the classic symptoms.
Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms… I can feel my adrenals
secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol
coursing through my entire body…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: And I know there’s only one way to cure
it…</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What in the…?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh shit, the meltdown. It’s spread to the
tower.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: We’ve got to get the nanobot.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: It’s too late. Argon injected it.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You mean he’s polymerized, like me?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: That means the nanobot is still inside
him.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: What would happen if I threw him into the
core?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: The same thing I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Did you feel that?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Did I? I’ve been waiting for that for
years.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Not that.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: That. It’s the fall-out. We have to get out
of here.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: We gotta get in there!</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Hey, what’s up with the fence?</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel, just forget Argon. Let’s get out of
here. We’ll find another way to stop the waste.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: We don’t have time to argue, Susan.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I’m going to set you down outside. You have
to get over to the reporters outside the gate. We have to warn people
what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: You’re not going after Argon!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I have to!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Do the words ‘hero fantasies’ mean anything
to you? How about ‘infantile dementia’?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Maybe you’re right… but so what. I’m going
to beat the snot out of him.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: How apropos.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Ain’t it.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: As you can see I am a new man, just like
you.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Oh no. You’re not like me. In fact, I’m
betting you’re the same greedy, remorseless, egomaniacal bad guy you
always were.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: It remains to be seen who is the good guy and
who is the bad guy. History is written by the victor.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: The only history I’m gonna write is your
obituary!</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Icky!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Get him, Daniel! Knock his block off!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel!</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: That-that’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Okay, Barbie, let’s get this over with.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Don’t worry, four eyes.</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: It’s not going to take long.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: We are just outside Argon Labs and I can,
without fear of hyperbole, say that what is happening behind me is the
most unbelievably fantastic thing the world has ever seen.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: Two men, if they are indeed really men,
locked in mortal combat.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: One of them apparently the dangerous
radical environmentalist authorities have been searching for. The other
appears to be Icarus Argon, or at least Icarus Argon fifteen years
ago.</p>
<p><strong>spencer</strong>: There are times, singular fleeting moments
when a man glimpses an event which he knows is going to change the
world. Although I do not fully understand what is happening here, I
sense that this fight is somehow about the future of the planet.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: I know what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You mean besides kicking your ass?!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: You think you can use me to stop the
meltdown.</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: It’s not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Not so fast, Icky, I promised you an
ass-beating and I’m just getting started.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Well, Argon, according to you this makes me
the good guy, don’t it?</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Die! Die! Damn you! Why don’t you just
die!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: No! Oh no!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: No. O’Brien! Don’t! Please!</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: Please, O’Brien, don’t do this to me! I’ll
give you anything you want!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Yeah, I’m going to finish what you started
–</p>
<p><strong>argon</strong>: You can’t do this! You owe me, O’Brien. I
made you plastic! I made you!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: That’s right. And making me was the biggest
mistake you ever made!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Grab my hand!</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Icky…?</p>
<p><strong>poppy</strong>: Plastic means forever…</p>
<p><strong>nebbleman</strong>: This is all your fault, Susan…</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Susan! Susan!</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: Noooo!</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: My hero…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: God, when we were in that store all I could
think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked
that little kid who wanted some cereal. Do you remember that?</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I remember I was trying to help…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: God, what a fight that was.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: We were different people then.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Do you suppose that was our problem? We met
before our time? I think that happens a lot. People, events, planets all
just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks
into place.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: That moment of synchronicity where everything
seems to work out just the way it should.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: I suppose if there were a god, it would be
those moments that would make me believe in her… or him.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel, what is…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Daniel, please, don’t, not today, it’s such a
nice day…</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Aww shit.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: You’re right. It is a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I can throw it out. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>susan</strong>: Things do change.</p>
<p><strong>o’brien</strong>: I guess they do.</p>
