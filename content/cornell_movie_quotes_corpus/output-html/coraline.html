<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: Dras, dva, tri, chetyri. Dras, dva,
tri, chetyri. Dras, dva, tri …</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: Mer-sa-vich!</p>
<p><strong>mover 2</strong>: We’re here. Time to muscle up.</p>
<p>****: Got it? Almost there, just a few more. Come on, now, LIFT.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hello?… Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: You scared me to death, you mangy
thing!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I’m just looking for an old well. Know
it?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Not talking, huh?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Magic dowser, magic dowser: show… me… the
well!</p>
<p>****: Hoo! Let me guess, you’re from Texas or Utah; someplace dried
out and barren, right? I heard about water-witching before but it
doesn’t make sense; I mean, it’s just an ordinary branch.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: And I DON’T LIKE BEING STALKED, not by</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: He’s not really my cat; he’s kinda feral �
you know, wild? Of course, I do feed him every night and sometimes he’ll
come in my window `n bring me little dead things.</p>
<p>****: Look, I’m from Pontiac.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: MICHIGAN? And if I’m a “water witch”,</p>
<p><strong>then–</strong>: –where’s the secret WELL?</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: You stomp too hard and you’ll fall in it!</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: See? Supposed to be so deep if you fell to
the bottom and looked up, you’d see a sky full of stars in the middle of
the day.</p>
<p>****: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Surprised she let you move in…</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: … my Gramma. She owns the “Pink Palace” Won’t
rent to people with kids.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Uh… I’m not supposed to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: I’m Wybie, Wybie Lovat.</p>
<p>****: Wybie?</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Short for Wyborne. Not my idea, of course.
What’d you get saddled with?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I wasn’t saddled with anything. It’s
Coraline.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Caroline what?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Coraline. Coraline Jones.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Hmmm… It’s not real scientific, but I heard
an ordinary name, like Caroline –</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: – can lead people to have ordinary
expectations about a person–</p>
<p><strong>wybie’s grandmother</strong>: Wyborne!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I think I heard someone calling you,
Wyborne.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: What? I didn’t hear anything–</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Oh, I definitely heard someone, Why-were-
you-born.</p>
<p><strong>wybie’s grandmother</strong>: Wyborne!</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Grandma!</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Heh. Well, great to meet a Michigan water
witch.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: But I’d wear gloves next time.</p>
<p>****: Why?</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: `Cause that dowsing rod of yours? Uh, it’s
poison oak.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Ehh!!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I almost fell down a well yesterday,
Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I would have died.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hmmm. So can I go out? I think it’s
perfect weather for gardening.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: No, Coraline. Rain makes mud. Mud makes a
mess.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: But Mom, I want stuff growing when my
friends come to visit. Isn’t that why we moved here?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Something like that. But then we had the
accident.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Wasn’t my fault you hit that truck.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: I never said it was.</p>
<p>****: I can’t believe it – you and Dad get paid to write about plants
and you hate dirt.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Coraline, I don’t have time for you right now.
And you still have unpacking to do. Lots of unpacking.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: That sounds exciting.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Hey Jonesy, look what I found in Gramma’s
trunk. Look familiar? Wybie.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Huh… a little me? That’s weird.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: What’s his name, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Wybie. And I’m way too old for dolls.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hey Dad, how’s the writing going?…
Dad?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Hello, Coraline… And… Coraline doll?…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: D’you know where the garden tools are?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: It’s pouring out there, isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Humph, it’s just raining.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: What’d the boss say?</p>
<p>****: “Don’t even think about going out, Coraline Jones.”</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Then you won’t need the tools.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Uhhh, you know, this house is a hundred and
fifty years old.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: So explore it!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Go out and … count all the doors and
windows and write that down. List everything blue!</p>
<p>****: Just let me work.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Ewww!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Ahh!!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: No, no, no, no, no; GAAAA–!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: One boring blue boy in a painfully boring
painting … four incredibly boring windows … and no… more… doors…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: All right, little me, where are you
hiding?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hey Mom…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Where does this door go?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: I’m really, really busy!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I think it’s locked.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Pleeeeeeeeease!</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Uhhh…</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Will you stop pestering me if I do this for
you?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Bricks? I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: They must have closed this off when they
divided up the house.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: You’re kidding? And why is the door so
small?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: We made a deal. ZIP IT!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: You didn’t lock it.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: AaaaaH!!!</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Oh, my twitchy witchy girl,</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: I think you are so nice, I give you bowls
of porridge And I give you bowls of ice –</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: – cream!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Why don’t you ever cook, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Coraline, we’ve been through this before: your
Dad cooks, I clean, and you stay out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: I swear I’ll go food shopping soon as we finish
the catalog. Try some of the chard, you need a vegetable.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Looks more like slime to me.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, it’s slime or bedtime fusspot – now
what’s it going to be?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Think they’re trying to poison me?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Don’t forget about me, guys. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Good-night…little me.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Whoa…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: MMMMM, something smells good.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Mom?! What are you doing here in the
middle of the night?</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: You’re just in time for supper,
dear!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: You’re not my mother.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: My mother doesn’t have b-b-buh…</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: B-b-b-buttons? Do you like them?</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: I’m your Other Mother, silly. Now go
tell your Other Father that supper’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Well, go on. He’s in his study.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Hello, Coraline. Want to hear my new
song?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: My father can’t play piano.</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: No need to … this piano plays ME!</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Making up a song about Coraline. She’s
a peach, she’s a doll, she’s a pal of mine. She’s as cute as a button in
the eyes of everyone who ever laid their eyes on Cor- a-line.</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: When she comes around exploring Mom
and I will never ever make it boring our eyes will be on Coraline.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I, uh � sorry � but she said to tell you
the food’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Mmmmm! Who’s starving? Raise your
hand.</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: We give our thanks and ask to bless,
Our Mother’s golden chicken breast!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Mmmm, this chicken is good.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Hungry, aren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: D’you have any gravy?</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Well, here comes the gravy train!
Choo- choo!</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Another roll, sweet peas? Corn on the
cob?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I’m real thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Of course! Any requests?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Mango milk shake?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Home?</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: We’ve been waiting for you,
Coraline.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: For me?</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Yep. Wasn’t the same here without you,
kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I didn’t know I had an Other Mother.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Of course you do. Everyone does.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Uh huh, and soon as you’re through
eating, I thought we’d play a game.</p>
<p>****: You mean like, hide and seek?</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Perfect! Hide and seek in the
rain.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: What rain?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Huh, what about the mud?</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: We love mud here!</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies –
it’s great for poison oak.</p>
<p>****: How’d you know I–</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I, I’d love to play, but … I better get
home to my other mother.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: But I’m your other mother.</p>
<p>****: I mean my other other mother. Mom number one?</p>
<p>****: I think I should get to bed.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Of course, sweetheart, it’s all made
up.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: But …</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Come along, sleepyhead.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>dragonflies</strong>: Hello Coraline, hello, hello!</p>
<p><strong>toy squid</strong>: What’s shakin’, baby?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p>****: Hey, how zit goin’, yuper!</p>
<p>****: Where’s your swampers and tuke?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Kripes a-mighty, how are my best trolls? I
can’t wait till summer. You’re both comin’, right?</p>
<p><strong>photo friend 1</strong>: We’re already here, Coraline –</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Oh, the mud…</p>
<p><strong>other mother other father</strong>: See you soon … See you
soon …</p>
<p>****: It’s gone, my poison oak, it’s gone!…</p>
<p>****: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: It was incredibly real, Mom! Only you
weren’t really you; you were my other mother.</p>
<p>****: Buttons for eyes, huh? Coraline, you only dreamed you ate all
that chicken. Take your multi-vitamin, at least.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: You were in the dream too, Dad. You had
wild-looking pajamas and orange monkey slippers.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.</p>
<p>****: Pssst. Can you get me some of that magic mud you were talking
about?</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Because I have a terrible case of writer’s
rash. On my—.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: If the real Charlie Jones wants his pages
edited, he’d better wrap them up ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Coraline, why don’t you go visit downstairs? I
bet those “actresses” would love to hear your dream.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Miss Spink and Forcible? But you said
they’re dingbats.</p>
<p>****: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Bo-bin-sky…Bo-bin-sky….Bo-bin-sky…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Ohh, Poo-eeeee!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: H-hello?…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I think our mail got mixed up. Should I
leave it outside or…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hmmm…</p>
<p>****: Famous Jumping Mouse Circus not ready, little girl!</p>
<p>****: Circus?… Oh, uh, I brought this for you.</p>
<p>****: Mmmm… Noviseer.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: New “cheese” samples.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: Very clever, using this “mix up” to
sneak my home and peek at meeshkas</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Meeshkas?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: The Mice!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Oh, sorry. I’m Coraline Jones.</p>
<p>****: And I am the Amazing Bobinsky! But you can call me Mr. B,
because amazing I already know that I am.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: Ha! You see, Caroline, the problem is
my new songs go oompah oompah. But the jumping mice play only toodle
toot, like that. Is nice, but not so much amazing? So now– –I switch to
stronger cheese, and soon �</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: Here, have beet. Make you strong. Daas
vee DAAN ya, Caroline.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Cor-a-line.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Oompah oompah, toodle toot, toodle
toot.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: No!!!</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: The mice…asked me to give you
message.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: The…jumping mice?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: They are saying: do not go through
leetle door. Do you know such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: The one behind the wall paper? But… it’s
all bricked up.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: Bah. So sorry, is nothing. Sometimes
the mice are leetle…</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: …mixed up, hmmm? They even get your
name wrong, you know. They call you Coraline instead of Caroline, not
Caroline at all.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bobinsky</strong>: Maybe I work them too hard…</p>
<p>****: Oh cease your infernal yapping! How nice to see you, Caroline.
Would you like to come in? We’re playing cards.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Still Coraline, Miss Spink.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Miriam, put the kettle on!</p>
<p><strong>miss forcible</strong>: April, I think you’re being
followed.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: It’s the new neighbor, Miriam -
Caroline? She’ll be having the Oolong tea.</p>
<p><strong>miss forcible</strong>: No, no, no, no. I’m sure she’d prefer
Jasmine.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: No, Oolong.</p>
<p><strong>miss forcible</strong>: Ah, Jasmine it is, then.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Come on, boys!</p>
<p>****: Are those dogs …. real?</p>
<p>****: Our sweet, departed angels. Couldn’t bear to part with them …
so we had them stuffed.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Now, there’s Hamish the third, the
fourth, the eighth, the ninth. Angus the second, the fifth, the..</p>
<p><strong>miss forcible</strong>: Oh go on, have one � it’s hand-pulled
taffy from Brighton � best in the world.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: …seventh, the third, the ninth, yes, the
fourthI’m right; and Jock Junior, Jock senior, Jock the third, the
fourth…</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: …oh, and that’s Jock’s 2nd cousin, twice
removed.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: I’ll read them, if you like.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Read what?</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Oh, your tea leaves, dear. They’ll tell
me your future. Drink up then, go on.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: No, not all of it, not all of it. That’s
right, now hand it over.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Oh… Caroline, Caroline, Caroline; you
are in terrible danger.</p>
<p><strong>miss forcible</strong>: Oh, give me that cup, April, your
eyes are going.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: My eyes! You’re blind as a bat!</p>
<p><strong>miss forcible</strong>: Oh, now, ummm… not to worry, child,
it’s good news: there’s a tall, handsome beast in your future.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Miriam, oh really, you’re holding it
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: See? Danger!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p>****: I see a very peculiar hand…</p>
<p><strong>miss forcible</strong>: I see a giraffe.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Giraffes don’t just fall from the sky,
Miriam.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>miss forcible</strong>: Oh, lord!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Well, what should I do?</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Never wear green in your dressing
room.</p>
<p><strong>miss forcible</strong>: Acquire a very tall step ladder.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: And be very, very careful. Now, was
there something you came to tell us?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: No, I guess not. Thanks for the tea,
though.</p>
<p><strong>miss forcible</strong>: Toodle-oo.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Cheery-bye.</p>
<p><strong>miss spink</strong>: Do you have any nice Queens for
mummy?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Danger?</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Owwwwwwww!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Great, the village stalker.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Ow. I - I wasn’t stalking you. We’re hunting
banana slugs.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: What d’ya mean, “we?”</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Ha! Your cat’s not wild, he’s a wuss-
puss!</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: What? He hates to get his feet wet. Geez.</p>
<p>****: Wuss-puss…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: So… that doll. Did you make it look like
me?</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Oh no; I found it that way. It’s older than
Gramma – old as this house prob’ly.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: C’mom - blue hair, my swampers and
raincoat?</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Dang, check out Slugzilla!</p>
<p>****: You’re just like them.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I meant my parents; they don’t listen to
me either.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Uh huh… You mind?</p>
<p><strong>effects</strong>: horrified of the slug one moment; ready to
eat it the next; pretending it’s something from his nose in another. She
can’t help but GIGGLE.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Ew!</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: You know, I’ve never been inside the Pink
Palace.</p>
<p>****: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Grandma would kill me. Thinks it’s dangerous
or something.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Well… she had a twin sister.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>wybie .</strong>: When they were kids, Grandma’s sister
disappeared.</p>
<p>****: She says she was stolen.</p>
<p>****: Stolen?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Well, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Uhhh, I-I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Maybe she just ran away?</p>
<p><strong>wybie’s grandmother</strong>: Wyborne!</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Look, I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Wait a minute!</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Welcome back, darling.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: So thoughtful of you to send this nice
cheddar, Coraline.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Cheddar?… Oh, the mice bait…</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Would you go fetch your father?</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Bet he’s hungry as a pumpkin by
now!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: You mean my Other Father?</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Your better father, dear. He’s out in
the garden.</p>
<p><strong>coraline.</strong>: But my parents don’t have time to
garden.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Mmmmmm!</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Go on…</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Hey!!!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I love your garden!</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Our garden, Coraline!</p>
<p>****: Oh ah, stop! Stop tickling, ah!</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Oops, daughter in distress!</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Tickle no more, you dragon
snappers!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Well, she says it’s time for dinner …
breakfast … food?</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Hop on, kiddo, I want to show you
something!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I can’t believe you did this!</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Mother said you’d like it! Boy she
knows you like the back of her hand.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Mmmm…so good!</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: I love dinner, breakfast food.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you
to come see the Jumping Mice perform after dinner.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Really. That know-it-all Wybie said it was
all in Mr. B’s head, I knew he was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Well, everything’s right in this
world, Kiddo.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Your father and I will clean up while
you and your friend head upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: My friend?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Great… another Wybie. Hello, Why-were-
you-born.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: I thought you’d like him more, if he
spoke a little less. So I fixed him.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: So he can’t talk at all?</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hmm, I like it.</p>
<p>****: Now run along, you two, and have fun.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: You’re awful cheerful, considering you
can’t say anything.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Uh…It didn’t hurt, did it, when she…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Whoa… cool!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Look at you!</p>
<p><strong>other mr. bobinsky</strong>: Lady and gentleman! For to

<p><strong>other mr. bobinsky</strong>: Very very thank you, lady and
gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: We loved it, Mr. B. It was … so … so–</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: A-mazing!</p>
<p><strong>other mr. bobinsky</strong>: You are very velcome anytime you

<p><strong>other mr. bobinsky</strong>: Dosvedanya, Coraline.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Ughhh.</p>
<p><strong>coraline .</strong>: … there were garden squash like balloon
animals AND snap dragons.</p>
<p><strong>on family</strong>: Coraline continues from back seat as her
father and mother review their work pages.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Oh, and upstairs I saw a real mouse
circus, not pretend like the crazy man’s in our house.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: You sure you won’t come?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Don’t fret, Charlie, they’ll love the new
catalog. At least, they’ll love my chapters.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: I did not call him crazy, Coraline. He’s
drunk.</p>
<p><strong>charlie</strong>: Well, I guess I’ll see you around, you
dizzy dreamer.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Da-ad! I’m not five anymore.</p>
<p><strong>young rascal</strong>: My kingdom for a hooooooorse!!!!</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Put them back.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: But Mom, the whole school’s gonna wear
boring gray clothes. No one will have these.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Put them back.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: My other mother would get them.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Maybe she should buy all your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: So what do you think’s in the other
apartment?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: I don’t know. Not a family of Jones
imposters.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Then why’d you lock the door?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Oh, I found some rat crap and… I thought you’d
feel … safer.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: They’re jumping-mice, Mom! And the dreams
aren’t dangerous; they’re the most fun I’ve had since we’ve moved
here.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Your school might be fun.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: With those stupid uniforms? Right.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Had to give it a try.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: How do you feel about a mustard-ketchup- salsa
wrap for lunch?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Mmm… Had to go food shopping anyway. Dad’s
planning something special.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Gross-gusting.</p>
<p>****: You wanna come along? You can pick out something you like.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Oh, like the gloves?</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Look, Coraline… if things go well today, I
promise I’ll make it up.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: That’s what you always say.</p>
<p><strong>mel</strong>: Won’t be long.</p>
<p>****: But I might be…</p>
<p><strong>angle on coraline</strong>: A SOFT BREEZE MOVES her hair. She
knows before her eyes open that the BRICKS ARE GONE.</p>
<p>****: I knew it was real!</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Dearest Coraline,</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: iss Spink and Miss Forcible have invited you
downstairs after lunch. I hope you like the new outfit I made you! Love,
Mother.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hmmm… Wybie’s got a cat like you at home.
Not the quiet Wybie; the one that talks too much. You must be the Other
Cat.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: No. I’m not the other anything. I’m me.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Um… I can see you don’t have button eyes.
But if you’re the same cat, how can you talk?</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: I just can.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Cats don’t talk at home.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p>****: Well, you’re clearly the expert on these things. After all, I’m
just a big fat wuss puss.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Come back. Please? I… I’m sorry I called
you that, I really am.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: How’d you get here?</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: I’ve been coming here for a while.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: It’s a game we play. She… …hates cats and tries
to keep me out. But she can’t, of course.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: I come and go as I please.</p>
<p>****: The Other Mother hates cats?</p>
<p>****: Not like any “mother” I’ve ever known.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: What do you mean? She’s amazing!</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: You probably think this world is a dream come
true. But you’re wrong. The Other Wybie told me so.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: That’s nonsense. He can’t talk.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: Perhaps not to you. We cats, however, have far
superior senses than humans and can see and smell, and –</p>
<p>****: Shhhh! I hear something! Right …over…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hey, Wybie.</p>
<p>****: She’s practically naked!</p>
<p><strong>other miss spink</strong>: I’m known as the siren of all
seven seas The breaker of hearts by the bay.</p>
<p><strong>other miss spink</strong>: So, if you go swimmin’ With
bow-legged women, I might steal your weak heart away.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>other miss forcible</strong>: A big-bottomed sea witch may
bob through the waves, And hope to lead sailors astray, But a true ocean
goddess, Must fill out her bodice, To present an alluring display.</p>
<p><strong>other miss spink</strong>: Beware of old oysters, too large
in the chest, Let’s banish them from the buffet.</p>
<p><strong>other miss spink</strong>: I’m far more nutritious</p>
<p><strong>other miss forcible</strong>: You smell like the fishes</p>
<p><strong>other miss spink</strong>: Did I hear a banshee?</p>
<p><strong>other miss forcible</strong>: You’re sea-green with envy</p>
<p><strong>other miss spink</strong>: This mermaid enchantress,</p>
<p><strong>other miss forcible</strong>: No, I “Birth of Venus!”</p>
<p>****: Will send sailors swooning –oh–!</p>
<p><strong>other miss spink</strong>: Will send sailors swooning
–oh–!</p>
<p>****: I can’t look!</p>
<p><strong>other miss spink</strong>: Ready to break a leg, Miriam?</p>
<p><strong>other miss forcible</strong>: Our lives for the theater,

<p><strong>young forcible</strong>: What a piece of work is man! How
noble in reason!</p>
<p><strong>young spink</strong>: How infinite in faculty! In form and
moving how express and admirable!</p>
<p><strong>young forcible</strong>: In action like an angel!</p>
<p><strong>young spink</strong>: In apprehension how like a god!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Ahhh!!!</p>
<p><strong>young forcible</strong>: The beauty of the world!</p>
<p><strong>young spink</strong>: The paragon of animals!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Yeah!!</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Hey there.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Was it wonderful, dear?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Oh yeah. They swooped down and pulled me
right out of my seat � Spink and Forcible. Only they weren’t old ladies,
that was just a disguise. But then, I was flying through the air and… it
was, it was magic.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: You do like it here, don’t you,
Coraline?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Uh-huh! Good night, Wybie.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: You could stay here forever… if you
want to.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Sure…we’ll sing and play games, and
Mother will cook your favorite meals.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: There’s one tiny little thing we need
to do.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Well, it’s a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: For you … our little doll.</p>
<p>****: Black is traditional, but if you’d prefer pink or vermillion or
chartreuse…</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: … though you might make me

<p><strong>coraline</strong>: If you won’t even talk to me, I’m gonna
find the Other Wybie. He’ll help me.</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: No point; he pulled a long face…</p>

I’M doing.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Huh? Something’s wrong. Shouldn’t the old
well be here?</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: Nothing out here … it’s the empty part of this
world. She only made what she knew would impress you.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: But why? Why does she want me?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Eat? That’s ridiculous, mothers don’t eat
daughters!</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: I don’t know. How do you taste?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Huh? But how can you walk away from
something and still come back to it?</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: Walk around the world.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Small world.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: Hang on–</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Stop, he’s one of the circus mice!</p>

mother?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: You aren’t my mother.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: Apologize at once, Coraline!</p>

<p>****: You … you mean the Other Mother? …</p>

<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Why are you all here?</p>
<p><strong>all ghosts</strong>: The Beldam!</p>
<p><strong>sweet girl ghost</strong>: She spied on our lives, through
the little doll’s eyes,</p>
<p><strong>boy ghost</strong>: And saw that we weren’t happy.</p>
<p><strong>tall girl ghost</strong>: So she lured us away,</p>
<p><strong>tall girl ghost</strong>: with treasures and treats,</p>
<p><strong>sweet girl ghost</strong>: and games to play!</p>
<p><strong>boy ghost</strong>: Gave all that we asked -</p>
<p><strong>sweet girl ghost</strong>: yet we still wanted more -</p>
<p><strong>tall girl ghost</strong>: So we let her sew the buttons.</p>
<p><strong>boy ghost</strong>: She said that she loved us,</p>
<p><strong>tall girl ghost</strong>: But she locked us here</p>
<p><strong>all ghosts</strong>: And ate up our lives.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Well, she can’t keep me in the dark
forever; not if she wants to win my life. Beating her is my only
chance.</p>
<p><strong>sweet girl ghost</strong>: Perhaps, if you do win your
escape, you could find our eyes?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Has she taken those, too?</p>
<p><strong>sweet girl ghost</strong>: Yes, miss. And hidden them.</p>
<p><strong>boy ghost</strong>: Find our eyes, mistress, and our souls
will be freed.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I … I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Did she do this to you?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I hope that feels bet–</p>

<p><strong>wybie</strong>: C-can you � can you unlock it?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Not in a million years. But it wouldn’t
matter; she can’t escape without her eyes. None of the ghosts can.</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Huhhhhhh… So, uh, I really need to get that

<p><strong>coraline</strong>: But it’s all a trap!</p>
<p><strong>wybie</strong>: Yeah… Uh, I think I heard someone calling me,
Jonesy.</p>

“old” parents are. Perhaps they’ve grown bored of you and run away to
France?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: They weren’t bored of me. You stole
them!</p>
<p><strong>tall other mother</strong>: Now, don’t be difficult,
Coraline. Have a seat, won’t you?</p>
<p>****: Why don’t you have your own key?</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Only one key.</p>
<p><strong>tall other mother</strong>: Shhh!</p>
<p>****: The garden squash need tending, don’t you think, pumpkin?</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Squish squash, pumpkin sauce…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Mom, Dad, where’d she hide you?</p>
<p><strong>tall other mother</strong>: Breakfast-time!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Be strong, Coraline.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Why don’t we play … a game? I know you
like them.</p>
<p><strong>tall other mother</strong>: Everybody likes games.</p>
<p>****: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>tall other mother</strong>: What kind of game would it
be?</p>
<p>****: An exploring game … a finding things game.</p>
<p><strong>other mother</strong>: And what is it you’d be finding,
Coraline?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: My real parents.</p>
<p>****: Too easy.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: And, and the eyes of the ghost
children.</p>
<p><strong>tall other mother</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>tall other mother</strong>: What if you don’t find them?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: If I lose, I’ll stay here with you forever
and let you love me. And I’ll let you sew buttons into my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>tall other mother</strong>: Hmmm… And if you somehow win this
game?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Then you let me go. You let everyone go �
my real father and mother, the dead children, everyone you’ve trapped
here.</p>
<p><strong>tall other mother</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Not till you give me a clue.</p>
<p><strong>tall other mother</strong>: Oh, right… In each of three
wonders I’ve made just for you, a ghost’s eye is lost in plain
sight.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: And for my parents?</p>
<p>****: Fine. Don’t tell me…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: …it’s a deal–</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: What does she mean “wonders?”</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: No!!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Stop!!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Why steal this?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Wow…</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: That must be it.</p>
<p><strong>other father</strong>: Sorrry, so sorrry, Motherrr making

<p><strong>other father</strong>: Taaaake it!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>boy ghost</strong>: Bless you, miss, you found me! But
there’s two eyes still lost.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Don’t worry, I’m getting the hang of

the door at half-speed. Haunting show song continues.</p>

<p><strong>other mr. bobinsky</strong>: Not even that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Ahhh! No!!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Noooo!</p>
<p>****: Oh God, I’ve lost the game; I’ve lost everything.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: I think I mentioned that I don’t like rats at
the best of times.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I think you might have said something like
that.</p>
<p><strong>cat</strong>: It looked like you needed this one,
however.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I’m heading inside. I still have to find
my parents.</p>

<p><strong>beldam</strong>: So? Where are they - the ghost eyes?</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: We aren’t finished yet, are we?</p>
<p><strong>beldam</strong>: No, I suppose not. After all, you still need
to find your old parents, don’t you? Too bad you won’t have this.</p>
<p><strong>sweet girl ghost</strong>: Be clever, miss; even if you win
she’ll never let you go!</p>
<p><strong>coraline</strong>: I already know where you’ve hidden
them.</p>
<p><strong>beldam</strong>: Well… produce them.</p>
