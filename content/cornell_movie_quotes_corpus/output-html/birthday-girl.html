<h1 id="birthday-girl">birthday-girl</h1>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello, hello. Hello…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t believe in perfect love. You know,
love that comes out of the sky like a thunderbolt and uh… This is
ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. No no no. Nope.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Running. Reading. Going out. Staying in. The
countryside. Films, if they’re good.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thoughtful. Outgoing. Ambitious. Well-read.
Reasonably popular. Balanced. Trusting. Quite attractive. Outgoing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Someone intelligent, of course. Kind. Pretty I
suppose. But its not critical.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Someone with a sense of humour. Someone you
can communicate with on the same level. Someone you can really talk to.
I think communication is key.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think that by the time most people turn
thirty they know where they’re going.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And where they’ve been. I suppose they have
some baggage stroke history.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We all have someone in our past who uh… one
skeleton, if you like. We’ve all got at least one person, as it were,
under the patio. Not literally of course. I suppose I only say this
because I always thought people who did this sort of thing were… I had
an image that they were losers. Not losers. A bit sad. But I think this
is the modern world. And I think really it’s quite a brave move. Quite a
brave, reasonable thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sorry can we start again?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nadia?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Welcome. Well. Look I didn’t have a speech
but…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is that everything?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right. Okay. Good.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We can talk in the car.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s about forty miles from here. I don’t know
if you’ve looked at a map, it’s close to London but it’s a city in
itself. A Roman city. It’s a nice house. I’m having a problem with ants.
I uh… It’s the warmer weather. I can’t seem to find the nest. Sorry, do
you understand “ants”?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I just can’t find a nest. The root of the
problem. I’ve looked everywhere. What’s the Russian for ant? Sorry
that’s a stupid… Sorry. This is strange isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m pretty nervous. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I mean… “Ants.” “I’ve got a problem with
ants.”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I had this…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: As a joke but uh…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So. Is it different to how you imagined
it?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I bet. What about me? Am I how you
imagined?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking
too fast for you?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do uh… Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you
understand what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good. Or should I speak slower?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do you follow or should I speak slower?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh… Are you a giraffe?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Lounge.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The uh… the other bedroom…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll get an ashtray.</p>
<p><strong>answer machine</strong>: You have reached From Russia with
Love. Our office reopens on Monday. If you are interested in our
services… Thank You.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is John Buckingham from St Albans. I need
to speak to you urgently. There’s a critical problem. It’s… Call me back
as soon as possible. It’s critical.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know what to say. Your letters were in
English. Good English. You said you’d studied English.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t take this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t take it. I’m not really a ring
guy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. No big deal. Thank you. Yes thanks.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If anyone gets this message please call as
soon as possible. It’s an emergency.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You should go now. We’ll talk in the
morning.</p>
<p><strong>answer machine</strong>: You have reached From Russia With
Love. If you are interested…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nadia. This isn’t going to work. I’m sorry.
It’s been a terrible mistake. You must go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m booking a flight for tomorrow. I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Problem solving. John identifies most
problems within appropriate time frames…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Most of the time he develops several
alternative solutions to problems…</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: He usually resolves or minimises most
problems before they grow into larger problems…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Good weekend?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh. Yeah. Pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Do anything special?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh. No.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: Communications. John listens and
comprehends well.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: When communicating he is good at
selecting the most efficient methods and displays effective verbal
communication skills…</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: On one occasion John showed first
class communication skills in a delicate customer situation.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: Initiative. John is reasonably quick
to volunteer whenever others need help. Although he is sometimes
reluctant and or unwilling to ask for it himself…</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: He is adequate at resolving
difficult or emotional customer situations…</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: He usually fulfills commitments made
to customers within expected time frames.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: Customer Service. John shows a high
degree of respect for customers…</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: John still has some reluctance to /
or has problems in, carving out new relationships face to face.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: Judgment – John makes able decisions
in most areas of his job.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: John follows instructions
conscientiously and responds well to personal directions.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: John is normally very punctual and
in most situations assumes responsibility for his own actions and
outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thank you – I think that’s very fair.</p>
<p><strong>voice over</strong>: It will feel very strange at first but
then you get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>trainer</strong>: Good. Again.</p>
<p><strong>trainer</strong>: Very good. How does that feel John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It feels good. Weird.</p>
<p><strong>trainer</strong>: It’s called Trust and Letting Go.</p>
<p><strong>trainer</strong>: Trust and Letting Go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Today is bath day.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Today is bath day.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Bath day?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Happy bath day.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Today?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Syevodnya?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Syevodnya</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Party. Party. Syevodnya.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes. Party. Party syevodnya.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: …It might just be a twenty-four hour bug…</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Well you just get better. I’ll tell Beaky.
You just get some rest, ok?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you.
Happy Birthday dear Nadia…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You must be John. You seem very nice. Excuse
me.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: How’s that? We can’t drink our piss can
we?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You must find some glasses, small, for the
toast, and some plates.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Sorry. You’ve lost me…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m asking what you’re here for.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You don’t speak Russian? Pratsteetye! This
explains your cold eyes.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: “Frenzy”.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes I know.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Yuri. Alexei. Alexei and Yuri.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He says he feels safe here.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: She says she wanted to tell you but her
English is shit. And no one speaks Russian, it’s very hard for her. The
light please.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I need to know who you are first please.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Oh. We are Russian.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes. I know.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus.
Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay.
Nadia is my little cousin. Except she’s not. But we say cousin. This is
for you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see
you are serious about us.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So hang on. You’re both Nadia’s cousins?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Of course not. Alexei, he’s is my problem.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We better watch him. He’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I am actor, he is actor, although he is an
actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I’m not so good. He makes me
look like a retard – He smokes me. I don’t mean he smokes me.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I mean he smokes me. Do you say “smoke” in
U.K.?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: So I come to England with other actors to make
shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and
the birthday here we are.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I asked her if you were happy to see us. I
find it hard to tell with you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes it’s okay. Thank you for the food.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: She says you are a little shy. I think I know
this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So how long will you be in England?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Plans are for the architects, politicians and
so forth.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You must have a visa or something…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You’re asking for my documents?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, no…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: We are all Europeans here. Europe, Tony Blair
and Maggie Thatcher!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: So. You have nothing to say to your Fiancee?
Maybe to wife of forty years it’s understandable. Come on. You speak and
I will translate.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: She says ‘Hello’ to you. Go for it John!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh. Do you like England?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Classic! Thank God. She says ‘Yes!’</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t think of anything. Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: She says she has a secret to tell.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: She says she watched you at the airport.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: “I saw you waiting there, by the gate.”</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: “I have these uh…” She explains to you… “When
I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses.” Like… I
don’t know the word. Like for watching uh… for watching the birds.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Binoculars.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has
kept from the war.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I would run around with them taking pictures
of things I liked with my mind. If I saw something beautiful I would
take a picture.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The day before I left Russia my father gave me
the old binoculars. He said that when I saw you I was to stand far away
and look at you with these, and to examine your face closely. And if you
were a bad person I could run away.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: She says she took a picture.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: Nasyekski.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Oh nothing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No. It is too judgmental.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tell me what he said.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He says why did you send to Russia for a
wife.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You are not ashamed of it? It’s no surprise to
want to love.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. It’s not that.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Do you believe in love?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I suppose it’s… I mean define your terms.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It’s very strange. How many people are truly
themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is
never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no
Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We
look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to
us. The one thing we all share but don’t say. Look John I will show you
something.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Here look, something beautiful from Russia.
Here is Life, there, take it.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Here is bread. Khylep. This is work. We all
need this, here eat.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Good. But we cannot survive with just work, so
here is meat and blood. Myasa. This is family and country, flesh,
strength, eat.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: But again this is not life. Here is joy and
pain. Chyesnok. Without these life has no flavour, is too serious.
Eat.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: But this vodka. Is love. Only this magic
changes you inside. The moon and the stars and the sun.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: This is a love song, a soldier’s song to his
beloved – Alexei, he’s Afghanstya, a veteran of Afghanistan. He saw
terrible things.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: Quick word John?</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: This is sensitive. Your car. Lovely
car. Doesn’t necessarily give the right impression.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ch…</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: To customers approaching the bank
from the rear</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: You can see why it’s sensitive?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh… Yes.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: I’ll leave it on your desk.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: John. We can see you hiding.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: How is bank?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fine. I thought you were leaving today.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: To be indoors on such a day. It’s crime.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He’s just having fun. He’s maybe too strong
you know…</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: They go. John. They go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: They go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: They go.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I understand. I’m so sorry</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You can stay tonight.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should
have come alone.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: John. You must call the Police.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: John, I’m sorry. It’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s he doing? What the fuck are you doing?
Leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He says sit down. Or he’ll cut her.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Sit down please.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tell him to stop and let her go, and we’ll
talk.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Put the fucking kettle down.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell
him put it down or I’m going to make him.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He says you scare him so much he must go to
the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We
must do what he says.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What? What does he want?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What did he say? Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I
don’t agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a
prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What does he want. The Russian shithead. What
do you want ?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He wants money.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tell him to put the kettle down and I’ll give
him money.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He wants a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll give him money. Tell him to put the…</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He wants the money from your bank.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll fuckin’ give it to him! We’ll go down
there.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: You don’t understand. He wants all the money
that is in your bank.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: He is sure you can do this. Of course you can
not.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh Jesus. Of course I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: Ah John. This is Robert Moseley,
Head of South East New Business. Robert, this is John Buckingham.</p>
<p><strong>moseley</strong>: Hello John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: I thought you could give us the tour
this morning. Sort of be our Indian Guide.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>moseley</strong>: Do you play?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes. I do.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: That’s John. He’s always surprising you with
hidden talents.</p>
<p><strong>moseley</strong>: I used to be in a band. Keyboards. Sort of
like very loud, uh – very loud Marillion.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: Well, Maestro, give us a tune.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll give you a tune later.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: Take the ball and run with it
John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is uh… This is the uh…</p>
<p><strong>passing colleague</strong>: Morning John. Give us a tune.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll give you a tune later.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is where we’re doing Trust and uh… Trust
and Letting Go.</p>
<p><strong>moseley</strong>: We’re not doing this till the fourth
quarter – Has it, uh – any results, has it been been beneficial?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>clare</strong>: It’s weird at first. Sort of exciting and
frightening at the same time. Wouldn’t you say John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>branch manager</strong>: We’re starting to see results. This
is Karen, who’s uh… taking uh… it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>colleague</strong>: Morning John. Hey, Moseley’s here.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll give you a tune later.</p>
<p><strong>moseley</strong>: It’s weird isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: There’s over eighty thousand here.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Sweet Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: Put it in the cases. Split it up. And don’t
forget you owe me �150.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: You know what for.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: No I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: I got you those trousers from Paul
Smith.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’ve been buying you stuff all week. I’ve been
buying him stuff all week.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: Such as?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid?
When we went to see ‘Cats’. Who paid?</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: Those aren’t presents. That’s normal
friendship stuff</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I paid for those guitar cases.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What was ‘Cats’ like?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: It was alright.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: Yeah it was okay.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I
really liked.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: The sets were good.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: The sets were excellent. Everything was big,
you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when
you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: So. How many times did you have to fuck
him?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: I’ll show you something. It should make all
this easier I think.</p>
<p><strong>yuri</strong>: Not all these bastards were like you, believe
me. You should not too feel bad.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It’s enough isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You know what I mean babe, It’s enough. We
can stop.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: Do you want to stop?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: We’ll stop then.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It’s nothing. I burnt myself.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: That’s not a burn.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It is. I did it cooking.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: On both wrists?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What? I did it cooking.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Listen, I made you something.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Put it on.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It’s taken me weeks. I want to see you in
it.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Say thank you.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: We’re going to have a baby.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You heard what I said. I’m pregnant. I’ve
been throwing up for weeks.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: We’re having a baby.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: A baby? What are we supposed to do with a
baby?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Name it.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Great. You’ve split my fuckin, lip.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Good morning. What can I get you?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I’ll have an espresso, with a small pastry, a
croissant or something.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: We only do a croissant with the
Continental breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Just get me a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: One coffee. And for you Sir ?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: He’ll have a coffee.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You can’t smoke in here.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I don’t expect you to understand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. In my job as Deputy
Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the
problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding
and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you
see, I’m not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I’m a bank
robber.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You don’t understand anything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think that about covers it. I think I have
grasped the part about you being dumped though. That’s got to hurt, I
imagine. That’s got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer’s
capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Unless. Unless this is part of the routine.
You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal
My Cup Of Coffee.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It’s makes it easier. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t want to know.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It makes it faster. If I don’t speak to the
men, they fall faster. It’s pretty obvious why.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s a relief. It’s nice to know I’m a
regular guy.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: So what are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m going to drink my coffee. Then, we’re
going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job,
house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: They don’t blame you. When a bank employee
does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you
hated that bank.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Even so I always felt the decision to burst in
and rob it very much remained with me.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Why else would you send off for me? If you
just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well as it turns out I did.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: More coffee?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes please.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Splendid. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: John, I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You must think… I’m the biggest pillock… In
the world.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: No I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: In the world.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I know you just want to punish me –</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I do. I want to very badly.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: So you’re just going to be vindictive</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: In every sense. If at all possible.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You can’t hurt me more than I’m hurt
already.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, Nadia, It it’s all the same to you, I’d
like to give it a bash.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: My name isn’t Nadia.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Where’s the restroom?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I’m going to be sick. Where’s the…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What? No you’re not..</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I’m going… I am… I’m going to be sick.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No you’re not. How… Nice one. How dumb do you
think I am ?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Where’s the restroom?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: The what, love?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: The toilet. Where’s…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Down there on the left.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Sir? Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Plenty of women have babies in prison.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You don’t have to do this. I can look after
myself.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Have you got your passport?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shut up. Have you got your passport?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ve got to get off this motor-way.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give me some money.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I don’t have any money.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I said I don’t have any.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Give me your sunglasses.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn’t his
name…</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I don’t want to talk about him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing
though. Must come as a hell of a shock.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So uh…</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Look, if you want to know is he better in bed
than you then yes he is.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: If what you want to know is does he have a
bigger cock than you, then yes he does.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of
course. Thank you. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: But, you know, so what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s his baby I take it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody.
You must be pretty miffed.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: He will come back.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: He left me my passport and ticket. It’s
pretty clear he wants to see me again.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I
really want to see again too.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: No. But you tend to tie them up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fuck off.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Fuck off. You started it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shut up. I’m not listening.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You don’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Okay we won’t talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: We’ll pretend it never happened.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So. What’s it like having to fuck men you
hate?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I don’t hate you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. Let’s… Okay. Okay. You have had sex with
people you don’t like haven’t you? For money. To make money.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: And? What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And. It’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: And who says what is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And that would be Morals. That would be one’s
own moral sense of decency.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What’s a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it
feels exactly.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So. What then? You just detach sex from
everything..</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Whereas “Wet ‘n’ Wild” is an emotional
journey. “Tied and Tethered”. It’s pretty moving huh? Like Anna
Karenina.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen. I didn’t go rooting around in your
private stuff.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Funny. Usually it’s the first thing they
do.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So what? Do you just switch off in your head
or do you imagine you’re with him, or what?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sometimes which?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Sometimes neither.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Some… What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: There’s nothing wrong in liking sex,
John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t like sex. I don’t think I’ll be having
sex ever again.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, it’s just that the thought trying to
charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter,
makes me want to die.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: So now you hate all women?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think it’s my safest bet, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think
you got what you paid for.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I got what I paid for.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You didn’t mind too much.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It wasn’t what I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: So what did you want? I think we understand
each other, no?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t understand me.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You don’t understand you either.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It’s no big thing. You are the same as most
men. You are a man so you are a savage. Not a monster, but half animal.
You put on a tie and you go to the bank, but really you are a beast. But
also you are from woman so you have a soul. Half beast, half soul. But
you hide your beast in the bottom of the wardrobe. It’s not so healthy.
It’s fucked you up, no?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get out</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You are throwing me out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You prefer your women mute.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Car trouble?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It’s another twenty miles. It’s going
dark.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jesus. You weren’t even on the plane.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You know, in Russia, there’s no work for
women. It’s a different world.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t have to say anything</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What? I… I wasn’t saying…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Please, there’s no… Oh.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I wasn’t saying anything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Then okay. So how old were you when you met
him?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Fifteen. You don’t know him. He was very kind
and strong.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. He’s a smashing bloke.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: The rest of the world, John, it’s not all
like St. Albans.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Thank Christ for that.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You are pretty naive if you think it is.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do
all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I don’t have nothing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well what have you got?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I have my baby.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do you know if it’s a boy or a girl?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Have you had any before?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Are you scared?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Not really. Maybe a little.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Listen. I think it’s a fox.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It sounds close.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I can’t see anything. It’s too dark.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What happened between you and the blonde?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: The thin… the girl with small eyes. The one
in your cupboard.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s none of your business. She didn’t have
small eyes.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Did she leave you? Come on. It’s nothing to
be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A
woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to hurt you. I’m
sorry. That’s awful. Forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know why I said that. She’s not dead
at all.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know why I said it. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: She’s alive?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: She’s alive!! She is not dead?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Laugh it up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You should stop smoking. You’re pregnant. You
smoke like a fucking lab dog.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I’m trying to quit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve got news for you. It’s not working.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I smoke more these days. I smoke more when
I’m unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nobody’s that unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Maybe I want to die. Don’t you want me to
die?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t want anyone to die.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Except for Small Eyes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Except for Small Eyes.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: So why did it end?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What was her name?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Listen. It’s definitely a fox. Now I’m
scared.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You know you can come under the blanket.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I’ve got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. I think I better just go.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: John. These are for you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Please. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because it was a lie.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: No it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: I love you. I don’t need to tell you
that.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: I wouldn’t leave my child would I? You know
that. I was confused. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: It wasn’t easy for me. You know what I’m
like. I needed to know what I wanted. Now I know. It’s simple. I’m
happy.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: You still love me? Eh? Of course you do.
Come here. Yuri won’t be here for a while. Come on babe.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: What the fuck is he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: That’s that cigarette lighter I gave you
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: What? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: What. You’re what? You’re with this creep
now.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Leave him!</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: You have. You’ve actually fallen for this
prick.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: No I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: Babe it’s me. I won’t let you get away.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I’ll kill you if you try.</p>
<p><strong>subtitle</strong>: Fuck a duck.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Get their passports.</p>
<p><strong>alexei</strong>: Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Get your money.</p>

<p><strong>nadia</strong>: You’re a big surprise, you know.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, you see when I said I didn’t speak
Russian I wasn’t actually just making it up.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: I’m not asking you to marry me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. What? No. I know.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: It’s more like a date.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s a long way to go for a date.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: All that matters is to try…</p>
<p><strong>nadia</strong>: We can only try. Say it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
