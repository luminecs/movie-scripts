<h1 id="frances">frances</h1>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No one ever came up to me and said, ‘You’re
a fool. There isn’t such a thing as God. Somebody’s been stuffing
you.’</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It wasn’t a murder. I think God just died
of old age. And when I realized He wasn’t any more, it didn’t shock me.
It seemed natural and right.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: And yet I began to wonder what the minister
meant when he said, ‘God, the Father, sees even the smallest sparrow
fall. He watches over all his children.’ That jumbled it all up for
me.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But still sometimes I found that God was
useful to remember, especially when I lost things that were important.
‘Please God, let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings.’</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It usually worked. God became a superfather
that couldn’t spank me. But if I wanted a thing badly enough, He
arranged it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But if God loved all of His children
equally, why did He bother about my red hat and let other people lose
their fathers and mothers for always?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Bye, baby.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: See you next weekend, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I began to see that He didn’t have much to
do about hats or people dying or anything. They happened whether He
wanted them to or not, and He stayed in Heaven and pretended not to
notice.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I wondered a little why God was such a
useless thing. It seemed a waste of time to have Him. After that He
became less and less, until He was… nothingness.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I felt rather proud that I had found the
truth myself, without help from anyone. It puzzled me that other people
hadn’t found out, too. God was gone. We had reached past Him. Why
couldn’t they see it? It still puzzles me.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You’re going straight to hell, Frances
Farmer!</p>
<p><strong>kaminski</strong>: And do you think it’s radical for a man to
have a job and feed a family?</p>
<p><strong>york &amp; crowd</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>kaminski</strong>: Is it radical for you to have a hand in
shaping your future, and the future of your children?</p>
<p><strong>york &amp; crowd</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>kaminski</strong>: Is it radical for the wealth of this
country to be turned back to the people who built the country?</p>
<p><strong>york &amp; crowd</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p><strong>kaminski</strong>: Good! Because, Brothers, that’s you!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Seattle is in the news again as a high
school junior wins a national competition and a hundred dollar prize
with an essay denying God.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: This prompts civic officials to charge
that left-wing politicians are encouraging atheism in the city’s
schools. Miss Frances Farmer was unavailable for comment, but her mother
Lillian –</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Farmer, a well-known local dietician,
stepped to her daughter’s defense.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Frances has not turned her back on the
Lord, they’re just having a momentary difference of opinion. What child
hasn’t questioned the Lord’s mysteries in order to better understand
them? To paraphrase Mr. Voltaire, I may not agree with what she says,
but I’ll defend to the death her right to say it. Freedom of speech,
unlike in the dark countries to the east, still lives in America! And in
my home.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Hi Emma.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Bye Emma.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: C’mere. I wanna talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?
Hey!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m not gonna hurt you. I just wanna
talk.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Okay then…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well… you’re causin’ trouble, you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m causing trouble?! You’re a pain in the
butt! You newshounds’ve been after me and my folks ever since I won that
dumb contest. I’m just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I
think?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not me. But other people seem to.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah. Well if you didn’t put it in the
papers – nobody’d even know about it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a
newshound to you?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No… Actually, you look more like a cop.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s rich. Hey, if I was a cop, I’d be
packing, right? You see a gun? Go on, search me. Pat me down.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’ll… take your word for it. So who are
you, then?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Harry York. I work for Martoni Kaminski, he’s
running for Congress here.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, well –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You know, my Dad’s done some work for
Kaminski…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Now you’re catchin’ on. Don’t wanna get your
Daddy in hot water, do you?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Whattaya mean?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well… see the papers’ve got us pegged as
pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But I’m not. The newspapers’re –</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Right again. You’re no more an atheist than
my man’s a Red, but what they’re doin’, see, they’re addin’ up their
version of your ideas with their version of ours. Could look bad for
your Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski
too, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure don’t talk like you’re sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well aren’t you the smoothie. Now you’re
going to ask for my number, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I suppose not. Gotta ask you this, though:
for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well… I’ll give it a try, Mr. York.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Harry.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure don’t walk like sixteen, neither.</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: These are perilous times. With the economic
collapse comes hopelessness and desperation; and people turn to
dangerous ideas –</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: Those of us who represent law and order
must be vigilant. Who’s behind this, her mother?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Impossible. As her attorney, I’ve known her
for years.</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: What about the father, he’s a little pink.
Maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light, shift some support to
Kaminski and those jackals.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: He’s no influence; he doesn’t even live at
home. No, I think Frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended. It
was her teacher who entered it in the competition.</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: Well, the publicity must stop. It’s no good
for Seattle and no good for the country. Keep an eye on this, will you,
Alma?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Of course, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: It always amazes me, Lil, how you can whip
up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I can thank you for that. It was a
hard-earned talent.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Bread?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: When’s the last time you saw a hundred
dollars, Ernest Farmer?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Mama…</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’m not hungry. You two just enjoy
yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: I’m… I’m really proud of you, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thanks, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: An essay contest… a national contest. That’s
pretty impressive.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I didn’t have much to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: You wrote it, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah, I suppose… Dad, who’s Harry York?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Well, Harry York is a guy who… well, he does
a lot of things. Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: He talked to me today. Told me to keep my
mouth shut or I’d get everybody in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Yeah… well… it’s possible. Harry York and I
both work for Mr. Kaminski right now, and… well… There are lots of folks
in this country who never got a square break. That’s the way of things,
but Mr. Kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the
people in power get nervous.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Is Kaminski a Communist?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: No, no, no. All he wants to do is see the
common man get a little representation.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: He’s a socialist, then?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: The label’s not important, Francie. What’s
important is: this country’s got nine million unemployed and something’s
gotta be done about it. Besides: left-wing, right-wing, up- wing,
down-wing… they don’t mean much. All a label is usually is a way to call
somebody a dirty name.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It’s already started, Dad… with me.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: And I can’t understand how it can hurt to
be honest, but the more I tried to explain –</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Don’t listen to him, little sister. When
you’re proud of what you are, you don’t refuse the label,
understand?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yes, Ma.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: And you… should be proud. You won that
contest and made a name for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You’re poisoning that child’s mind.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: I have a right to talk to her. She’s my
daughter, and she’s beginning to understand why I’ve sacrificed so much
in order to achieve…</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You’ve sacrificed?! If you’d practice law
for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents –</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: They need help, Lil. They pay me back in
other ways.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and
his friends? They’re all anarchists! Traitors!</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: No, Lil. It’s just you can’t understand
their brand of patriotism.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: That’s right. I can’t understand a man who
puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to
become a shiftless inkhorn failure.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: I’m going back to the hotel.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: See you next weekend?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer.
Just give me my due.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Lillian… I’m more than willing to meet you
halfway.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Don’t make me sick. I’d sooner drown myself
in Puget Sound.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: That’s a thought, Lil. That sure is a
thought.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor’s voice</strong>: Are you all right, dear?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’m fine, perfectly fine.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Dad, please, don’t leave early. Just
because of Mama –</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Francie, you’ll learn that sometimes it’s
best to stay low and just walk away.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What can we do, we must live! We shall
live, Uncle Vanya…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: And then we shall rest, we shall rest. We
shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds, we shall
see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy
that will fill the whole world. And our life will grow peaceful, tender,
sweet as a caress… Poor, dear Uncle Vanya, you are crying… In your life
you haven’t known what joy was; but wait, Uncle Vanya, wait… We shall
rest… We shall rest!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not bad, Farmer. Not half bad.</p>
<p><strong>drama teacher</strong>: Art is a constant struggle. Some of
you have the will but not the ability. For others, the opposite. I don’t
wish to be harsh, but only one of you on stage tonight combined the
two…</p>
<p><strong>drama teacher</strong>: On cue.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: I could really learn to hate her.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Stand in line.</p>
<p><strong>drama teacher</strong>: This is the answer: a subscription
drive to “Voice of Action!” First prize is a trip to Moscow! You could
visit the art theatre, maybe even meet Stanislavski!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But I’ll never win that.</p>
<p><strong>drama teacher</strong>: Yes, yes, it’s all arranged.
Everyone’s collecting subscriptions in your name. And the best part is:
the trip returns you to New York.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>drama teacher</strong>: New York, Frances! Broadway! This is
your chance! You belong on the stage!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You think I’d miss it?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well? What’d you think?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I just wanted to see how you looked.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: How’d I look?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Enh.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Don’t be a rat, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You looked okay. Joint’s pretty dead. How
’bout I take you home?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You really think so?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Honest. When you were up there, you were
really… there, know what I mean? Everyone else looked stupid.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t know… I did… feel different…
Alive.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah, it’s a gift. You gotta do something
with it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama’ll kill
me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though… to New York,
especially… but I wanted to do it…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Quietly.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re not the quiet type, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You know, my old man was an inventor. Spent
his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental
underground railroads, stuff like that. Well, I was supposed to be his
partner. When I told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, I
thought he was going to die right there.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He retired to Florida… made a killing in
vending machines.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, I
would have been miserable living his life.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …So you think I should go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure. Try this acting thing. You can make
good money at it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t know, Harry. I… I want so many…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You don’t know what you want.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Not in the long run, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frances…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well… don’t you think it’s up to me to…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Come on, Harry. This is America, land of
the free. I thought we might go skinny dipping. For starters.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Communists?! No daughter of mine is going
to Communist Russia!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You act like I’m a bomb-thrower, Mama. It’s
just a trip.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: But they’re using you!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh Ma, they’re not using me. It’s just a
chance to travel, see things. Besides, it’s the only way I can get to
New York.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’ll pay your way to New York. I’ll work,
I’ll slave. I’ll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh, Mama, don’t you understand?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I have to do this on my own. You see, I’ve
learned your lesson very well. To do what I think is right and everyone
else be damned.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I never taught you that!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Little sister, if you don’t wise up soon,
it’s going to be out of my hands!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It isn’t in your hands, Mama. It’s my
life.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Yes, but important people are concerned
about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: …You will.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What do I do, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: You really want to go?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: And you think it’s worth all this?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: If I didn’t, I wouldn’t put you through
it.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: …Then go.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: The authorities tell me there’s no legal
way I can stop her, but the way I see it, it’s bigger than me or my
family… American integrity, that’s what’s at stake here. They’re sending
my daughter to the heartland of darkness. . .the dark forces that would
overthrow our country. Your country. My country.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Has your earlier denial of God led you
to Communism?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m not a Communist.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: But Frances, you said –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I said all countries are of cultural
interest. Besides, Russia has the greatest theatre company in the
world.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Better than any American company?</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: What do you think of Stalin?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Not much. Ask me about Stanislavski.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Help me save my daughter! Save the children
of America.</p>
<p><strong>tall spectral man</strong>: Repent, Frances, Repent!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Repent! Repent!</p>
<p><strong>tall spectral man</strong>: Bless you, sister, bless you.
Here is a Bible for solace… and this plant to remind you of the eternal
seed in all of us… and finally, a flashlight to illuminate your path
through darkest Russia.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I love you, Mama. I love you, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Be careful, Francie.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Frances, I’m warning you. I’m gonna throw
myself beneath the wheels. I’ll do it, Frances. Frances!</p>
<p><strong>first reporter</strong>: What do you say now,
Mrs. Farmer?</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: One more time.</p>
<p><strong>publicist</strong>: Hobbies?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh, I swim some… play the piano badly… and
I read like a fiend: I like history.</p>
<p><strong>publicist</strong>: No, no, people don’t want that. Now
listen: you spend lots of time at the beach. You’re crazy about dancing.
And you’re the kind of girl who’s just a little in love with love. Get
it? Now try again? Hobbies?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Look, I…</p>
<p><strong>publicist</strong>: Beach… dancing… in love with love.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: That’s me.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Bebe!</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Frances Farmer, contract player, six- month
option.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: Okay. Good tits. Can’t we show them off a
little more?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I guess so, sir.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: Very fine bone structure.</p>
<p><strong>publicist</strong>: Not much to work with. How’s this: ‘The
most interesting thing about Frances Farmer is that her road to
Hollywood was 12,000 miles long. After winning a beauty contest, the
first prize of which was a trip to Europe…’ She made some deal with the
Commies and went to Moscow, but I’m not going to say that, am I?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Heavens no. Go on.</p>
<p><strong>publicist</strong>: Um… ‘Miss Farmer returned to New York
City and had a brief fling with the Broadway stage before coming west to
seek stardom.’</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: ‘Brief fling?’</p>
<p><strong>publicist</strong>: Well, actually she couldn’t get hired,
but lucky for her, some guy in our New York office saw her. She says
soon as she gets a stake, she’s going back.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Did you get the check?… Oh my God, it
opened?!, what’d you think?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well, I hope I get bigger parts, they don’t
come much smaller.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, I’m fine. I just have water in my
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, Mama, I’m not changing my name. They
can’t actually make you, you know? Most people don’t realize that. Oh
Dick…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, no, nothing’s going on. I love you too,
Mama. Give my love to Dad. Bye!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Okay, handsome. You win.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Kurt!</p>
<p><strong>fire chief</strong>: Oh, Angela! Go with these trappers!
They’ll lead you safely down the mountain…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But, Kurt, I…</p>
<p><strong>fire chief</strong>: No, No arguments. Be my good girl and
go. There’s a forest, a burning forest, and you know what I have to
do!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh, Kurt!</p>
<p><strong>fire chief</strong>: Oh Angela, my own… Angela!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m sorry… I’m sorry, let’s go back.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: What the hell is that? What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>laughing man</strong>: That’s talent, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>man #1</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Harry! Harry-god-damn-York! A real
person!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How ya doin’, Farmer?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Me? Look at you! What’re you doing in
Hollywood?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Came to get a tan.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Not bad. But come on, Harry; what’s the
real reason?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Kaminski.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business,
suicide.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Since when do you believe the papers? They
killed him, kid.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They killed him. They threw him out that
window.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Eight stories.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yup. Poor bastard lay there on the sidewalk
and he couldn’t die. Too god damn much heart. He just didn’t want to
die.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But… but why, Harry…? Why’d they do it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He wouldn’t play ball. What can I tell ya…
it’s done. Anyway, I didn’t want to be next, so I skipped town; came
down here to work for some big-wig. Tail and nail job. I’m sort of a
non-gentleman’s non- gentleman. How d’ya like the camouflage?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You jackass! C’mon, let’s get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Not bad. It was slow at first, but I’m
doing bits now.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I always told ya, Frances. You got real
ability.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I know what ability you’re interested
in.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, I’m a man, aren’t I? Whattaya say we
have dinner, then maybe head out to the beach, rub some of this tan off
each other. For old time’s sake.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Harry… I met someone.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah? What is he – muscleman? Lifeguard?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Actor?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Good. Then it’s temporary. All actors are
phonies.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Serious, huh?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey that’s great, Farmer, just great.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: These creases… I look like I just came from
the laundry! I’m supposed to be hiding out in boxcars, sleeping on
floors.</p>
<p><strong>wardrobe mistress</strong>: This is the suit we fitted on
you, Miss Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh, I know that. But it could look more
realistic, don’t you think?</p>
<p><strong>wardrobe mistress</strong>: It’ll do. No one will notice.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’ll notice.</p>
<p><strong>wardrobe mistress</strong>: Oh, Mr. Bebe, good morning.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: Come along with me, Fanny.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: That’s Frances. I’m not the cookbook.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: You see: We’ve got to change that name.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: I like your looks. You have the classical bone
structure of the very great beauties… Garbo, Dietrich –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thank you –</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: I intend to make a great deal of money off
you.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: Since we have you on a seven year contract,
I’m planning long-range. I’m going to loan you out to Sam Goldwyn to
make a picture called “Come and Get It.”</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Really? That’s a very good book. It’d make
a terrific –</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: Never mind that. I’m concerned about you. Your
attitude.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: Society is falling apart, Miss Farmer, and
people have to buckle down, do their jobs. You see, I view myself as the
Henry Ford of motion picture industry, and I can’t have the fellow who
puts on the wheels arguing with the man who installs head-lights, now
can I?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But I’m concerned with everything,
Mr. Bebe.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: No, I’m concerned with everything.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But I’m the one up there on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: That’s right. You’re an actress, Miss Farmer
and your job is to act.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not bad, Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I guess it’s no secret that I’m proud. Only
twenty-one years old, and look at all she’s done. As for her looks, I
flatter myself that she gets them from me.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: And not only has Frances come home a star;
she’s also brought me this big handsome lug of a son-in-law!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mr. Farmer, what was your reaction when
Frances told you she had married…</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Dwayne. Dwayne Steele.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: What…? Oh. Well, I was pleased, of course.
Richard… uh, Dwayne, is a real gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Well, all I can say is: I feel like I’ve known
these two for years!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh, Dwayne! This is like a fairy tale!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>studio executive</strong>: Let’s go. We’ll be late.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: There she is!</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: How does it feel to be back in Seattle,
Frances?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: A little strange.</p>
<p><strong>women’s voices</strong>: Isn’t she gorgeous?</p>
<p><strong>studio executive</strong>: This way.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #2</strong>: How’s the movie, Frances?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Smile, little sister, smile.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Can you make some statement about
Seattle, how the city helped you, or the schools –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well, the truth is the city had nothing to
do with it. I was lucky. And what wasn’t luck was hard work.</p>
<p><strong>reporter #1</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>judge hillier’s wife</strong>: Miss Farmer, I can’t tell you
how proud I am to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>judge hillier’s wife</strong>: On behalf of the Seattle
Ladies Club, as a token of our vast admiration –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>judge hillier’s wife</strong>: Yes…?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Don’t I know you?</p>
<p><strong>judge hillier’s wife</strong>: I don’t believe so.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium
when I read my essay.</p>
<p><strong>judge hillier’s wife</strong>: No, my dear. You must be
mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>judge hillier</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Listen, I’m still the same girl that wrote
that essay, the same girl who went to Russia, and you people aren’t
proud to meet me at all.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …It’s one thing to marry the guy, but did you
have to sleep with him?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Shit. I meant the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well, the studio told me not to.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is that why you did it?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Who ever thought they’d be right for once?
Jesus, Harry… it’s a zoo back there –</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re telling me.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Dick… and my mother! She acts like she’s on
Mars or something –</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, she’s back to earth now. They’re all
pretty huffed up about your leaving. I think you better go back,
kid.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You know, the funny thing is: it’s not a
great movie. I mean it could’ve been, but they screwed it up, gave it a
happy ending. And all my friends, I know they’re going to smile and say
they loved it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: If they say they love it, they’ll probably
love it. Not everybody lies, you know?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, they don’t, do they?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frances, you’re a movie star now. If you give
them what they want, you can get anything.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t have what they want, Harry. Harry,
will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in
the streets are starving?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Some people starve, kid. Until we can do
something about it, they might as well see a movie. Makes ’em feel
better.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But I don’t want to be like that. I want to
do something…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’re you gonna do, waste your talent? Why
not use it to make something worthwhile. You can do that, you know?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah, if I don’t make too big an ass of
myself.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tell you what. Let’s ditch the limo. Let me
drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up Chevy.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: The hell you will, Harry York.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Come on, Cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Bong… bong… bong…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Don’t start, Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It’s midnight, Harry. My glittering
raiments are dissolving.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The chauffeur. He’s watching.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: He deserves a show. He missed the
movie.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m serious, Frances. This is important.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: A single glass slipper left glittering on
the pearly sands. Who was that girl, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: ‘Come and get it,’ Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hot damn!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Hi Frances, got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Sure, Claire. If you don’t mind walking my
way.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Well, I suppose I should just say it. It’s
your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: My clothes?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yeah, I mean slacks… and work clothes… and
that awful car –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It’s a perfectly good car. It runs.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes, but… Really, I hate to sound… it’s just
that the public expects something different from its stars. People won’t
take you seriously.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t care if my clothes are taken
seriously. Or my car.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds
out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they
find out I’m a real person. Oh no! Say it ain’t so! Not a real
person!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Morning, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: That’s not all, Frances. Mr. Bebe is very
concerned about your politics. He hears you’ve been donating money,
speaking at rallies.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yup. Claire… please, please tell Mr. Bebe
that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my
private life, we’d make a lot better movies.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m sorry, Frances. It’s my job, you
know?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I know. ‘This is a factory and we each have
our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress…’</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: …acts. I’ll relay your message.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Yes, of course she’ll make a statement on
women’s rights. Call back tomorrow, okay?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Dwayne Steele’s residence.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Yes. What…? Yes. Yes, I’ll tell her.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You learn your lines?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: There’ve been some calls.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Well… about half an hour ago that woman from
the talent department called, what’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Claire?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Fired?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Yeah. She said she delivered your message and
that you’d understand.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: There was another call too. From your agent.
He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you’re going back east,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Without me.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Showdown.</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: You weren’t going to tell me, were you? Just
pack up and leave, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Dick, we need some time apart –</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Hey, I’m not a complete fool, you know. I can
see you’re going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it,
you turn your back and say it’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Dick, I can’t even breathe here…</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: Dwayne! I’m Dwayne now! And you damn well
better get used to it!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Dick…</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: I don’t suppose it occurred to you that I
might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, ’cause you
don’t want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with
summer stock.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: No. It’s all about that night, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What night?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: The premiere. I never pressed you about it but
god damn it, you’re gonna tell me right here and right now what happened
and where the hell you were!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You want his name?</p>
<p><strong>dick</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: My God… I think you’re overplaying this a
bit…?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Goodbye, Dick.</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: The Group is more than a theatre company.
It’s the embodiment of an ideal. Our approach allows the actor to be an
artist in the fullest sense, a creative individual and an instrument of
change. You see –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Really, Mr. Clurman, you don’t have to sell
me.</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: Forgive my indulgence. Seems we always
lecture those who are on time for those who are tardy. The point is,
Mr. Odets here has written a wonderful play. Most of the roles are cast,
but we haven’t found our female lead…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Who is she?</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: She’s a tramp from Newark.</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: Forgive me, but I think you’d be perfect
for the part.</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: Miss Farmer, for me this is not a play: it’s
an assault… a seduction… a plea for understanding. I think we live in a
time when new art works should shoot bullets… and you make very
attractive ammunition.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: And what’s the title of this seduc…
assault?</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: ‘Golden Boy.’</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You wanted to talk?</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: You see that girl?</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: That’s who my play is about.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: That’s me, Clifford.</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: I know, but I’m not seeing it. It’s there,
Frances, the fire is there, but it’s not coming through. You’re lazy
–</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m not!</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: Yes, you win them, you bring them into your
heart, touch them, but you don’t set them on fire!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But I want to. I’m trying!</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: I need an incendiary! An arsonist!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Then show me! That’s what I’m here for, to
learn, to grow!</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: Good. Then it’s very simple. You have to stop
being afraid, Frances. It’s in you.</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: I can see it. You just have to let it out.
Trust it. No one will quash you here, but it’s still a fight, a
struggle! Being true to your art, being honest, is always a
struggle!</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: …Not only an artist, but an instrument of
change. We must look to the world around us, not content to observe, but
to take an active hand in redressing its wrongs. We will not stand idly
by as Fascist bombs obliterate democracy. We contribute our profits, for
if fascism is not stopped in Spain, it will spread across Europe,
jeopardizing the struggle of civilized man to survive.</p>
<p>****: The artist, to be vital, must be a soldier too.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m not afraid of struggle, Clifford.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Yes you are. We all are. The first step is
to acknowledge our fear.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Face it! Confess it! You’re weak!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m not!</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: You’re afraid!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m not!</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: You don’t want to show your whole soul –
ugly, mis-shapen, and pitiful – you don’t want to show it –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I
tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the
audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Good, good. Give them that.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Madam…?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Oh my God! Frances, I’m such a cad. I
can’t go through with this. My wife is in Europe, but this is her house…
her bedroom. I can’t ask you to…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh well. I guess I better leave then.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Okay, but come here first.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>clifford</strong>: Come here. I want to show you
something.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: And on top of her political activities, now
she’s got a lawyer. She wants out of her contract, Mr. Bebe. She says
she’s through with motion pictures.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: I’m sure it wasn’t me, it wasn’t me…</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Excuse me, sir?</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: I don’t know who she fucked to get where she
is, but I don’t think it was me.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Well… you could always dump her, Mr. Bebe.
Teach her a lesson. There are a million beautiful girls out there who
don’t give a damn about politics.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: That’s not the point. Frances Farmer has the
world by the tit because of this studio, and now she thinks she can
waltz off without a thank you. No. No, that young lady has a contract,
and she’s going to honor it.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Oh. I mean, good.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: I think it’s time to take the gloves off. Get
me some reporters. Particularly Louella Parsons!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Miss Farmer… I’ve never done this before…
but… I had to tell ya’ you’re great!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thank you very much. I’m glad you liked the
play.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I’m really sad it’s closing. Now what am
I gonna do on Tuesday nights?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You can always come see it in London.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Only if you were in it. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I wouldn’t miss it.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Boy, I’d love to… but I’m going to
Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Are you an actor?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Hell yes!… well, okay, I’m still in
school. But as soon as I graduate… California, here I come!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Are you really serious? About acting?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Why… yes.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Then don’t go to Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m telling you straight, if you have any
serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It’ll crush you.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You sound as if you hate it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, I don’t hate it.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Aren’t you ever going back?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …Not if I can help it.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Gosh! You’ll break a lot of hearts.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: They’ll mend.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: What about your husband?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Will you be getting back together? When
you quit Hollywood, I mean.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Is it true you’re getting a divorce?
Comrade?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Why, you… you little bastard!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Thanks for our chat, Miss Farmer. Be
seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Just one minute…</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: You’re wasting your time, lady. Nothing’s
off the record with me.</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: ‘But how do I know you love me?’</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: Your big speech?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: ‘How do I know it’s true? You’ll get to be
the champ. They’ll all want you, all the girls! But I don’t care. I’ve
been undersea a long time. When they’d put their hands on me I used to
say, “This isn’t it! This isn’t what I mean!” It’s been a mysterious
world for me! But Joe, I think you’re it! I don’t know why, I think
you’re it. Take me home with you.’</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: I already have.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: How’s it sound?</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: The speech? Real good.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You think I got it?</p>
<p><strong>odets</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Hello, Harold.</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Where’s Clifford?</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: Bourbon?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: I hear you’re meeting with the studio
lawyers to get out of your contract.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: That’s right. I don’t want them breathing
down my neck while we’re in London.</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: Well… well, you see, that’s the point. You
won’t be opening in London.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You don’t think I’m good enough?</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: What?! Good Lord no, it’s just… It’s money.
We needed backing and… well, we found it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: An actress.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: A rich actress.</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: Yes. That’s the deal. She plays Lorna.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But… but wait a minute. We’re supposed to
be different, right? Clifford says… This theatre is supposed to be
different! And this play… this play is all about what greed and money do
to people!</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: I know, but –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What does Clifford say?</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: Right now we have to be practical.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Does Clifford even know? You didn’t tell
him, did you? I’m gonna tell him. Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: He knows, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: He approved it.</p>
<p><strong>clurman</strong>: I’m very sorry, but… well, Hollywood wants
you back, right?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Prick!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Of course it can be done, “Mr. Jones,” but
it’s how you do it. There’s a way to pay off L.A. cops and a way to get
yourself arrested. First you gotta know who to approach –</p>
<p><strong>man at phone</strong>: You Harry York?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Harry? Harry, where are you?!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Jesus, Frances, how’d you find me?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I called your god-damned office! I want you
to kill him, Harry. You’ll do that for me, won’t you? I loved him, I
loved him… that bastard.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Calm down, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Don’t tell me what to do, just give me his
head on a platter!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Two lines! Two fucking lines! ‘My wife
returns from Europe tomorrow. I can’t see you any more.’ Just like
that!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frances…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Harry, I hate being in love. I don’t ever
want to be in love again. I just hate it!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I know, Frances… I know.</p>
<p><strong>a.d.</strong>: How was that?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Good, good. One more time.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: For God’s sake… why?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Because we want to get it perfect… just
the right combination of fury and confusion. You can understand that,
can’t you, Miss Farmer? We’re serious artists here, right? Right.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my
contract, but you can’t break me. I’m back, and I’m gonna make the best
of it.</p>
<p><strong>bebe</strong>: I’d like nothing better.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Well… come on.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: This is a mistake. No. This is a
disaster.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Come on, it’s just what you need! Let
everyone see you. Talk to them, live it up!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But we’ve been at it since six this
morning. At least you could’ve let me go home and change.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Look, Frances, I didn’t want this job. Think
I’m crazy? But you begged me: improve your image. So please… lemme try,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You’re right. I’m sorry. Okay, let’s go get
’em.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Here, take a few of these. Studio makes ’em
in the basement. They keep the fat off.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but
I’m fat too?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Come on. They make you feel nice and
peppy.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Hi! Bob Barnes! Looks like a swell
party!</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Frances!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: God, who’s here?</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: The usual vermin, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Get me a drink.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Hi everybody.</p>
<p><strong>snide voice</strong>: So nice to have you back, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Connie, can I use the upstairs
bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>connie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: You wouldn’t believe the offers! Just piling
in. I mean piling. Some of the best scripts I’ve read in years!</p>
<p><strong>young reporter</strong>: Yes? My employer will be glad to
hear that.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Louella? Is she here?</p>
<p><strong>young reporter</strong>: How could you miss her?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Louella’s here and I’m talking to you?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Frances? Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Refill my drink, will you, Bob?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: What’re you doing?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Putting on my armor.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Come on, Frances. Louella Parsons is here.
She wants to talk to you, help you out.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Louella… didn’t she call me a spoiled
little bitch?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Come on, she’s an important columnist!
What’s the matter? I thought you wanted these people to forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: ‘Forgive’…? For What?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: I’m sorry… that was an unfortunate choice of
words.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You’re not kidding. Get me a refill, Bob.
I’ll be down in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>young reporter</strong>: Gee, awful good to see ya again,
Miss Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>young reporter</strong>: My employer would like to know
something very important: is it true your friend Clifford sleeps in the
nude?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You seem like an intelligent young man.</p>
<p><strong>young reporter</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Can’t you find a more dignified way to make
a living?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Hey, where’s the fire, sister?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: In my eyes, officer.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Cool off, beautiful. Didn’t you see the sign
says “Dimout Zone?” There’s a war on, you know?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Come on. You’re seriously trying to tell me
the Japs can’t find Los Angeles without my headlights?</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: I didn’t make the law, lady. I just enforce
it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: God, you bore me.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Don’t touch me!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Santa Monica, this is motor six-sixty- six. I
got a live one here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Got any ginger beer?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: How the hell do you find me anyway?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Animal magnetism! No ginger beer. What’s this
red stuff?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What’s left of my blood.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Think I’ll have a glass.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Help yourself. Everyone else has.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Very tasty.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Nice joint. Can you afford it?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Nope. The studio pays. Thank you,
Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What for?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: For not chopping off his head and serving
it to me on a platter.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, I would have, you know? I just didn’t
know how to cook it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Six months’ probation…? You gotta learn when
to do battle, Farmer. You’re not going to win many bouts with 200 pound
cops.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I took the early rounds.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll bet.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t know. It hurts, Harry. Some things,
no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So you drink, and you fight with a cop…?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder
who the hell they are, what’s going on inside their heads. Sometimes you
can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And
you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Beats me.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I gotta get outta here. I gotta get out of
this town.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey look, I got some business down in San
Diego. Whattaya say you come with me, stay a few days?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, Harry, I can’t –</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You know… when I started acting, you know
what I wanted?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I just wanted to be part of something… one
thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine… memorable.
And I could say: I did that, I made something good.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well… to get a crack at something good, you
gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work
hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you
on. And then one day you realize you are, you’re at the top… and there’s
nothing there. And you look behind you and there’s no one below. You’re
just left there all alone… swaying in the god-damned breeze.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well, like the man said: “You can make a
fresh start with your last breath.”</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Hey, watch it.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Watch what?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Get away from me, you foul slime.</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: That’s no way for a lady to talk.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Take a walk, pal.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Who said I was a lady?</p>
<p><strong>sailor</strong>: Sorry I insulted you… bitch.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Ahhh, go eat a toilet seat.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What happened? Who’re you?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Who’re you?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I live here.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You’re Farmer? Oh… Well, look, they took your
stuff out. Moved it to some hotel, I think.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’m preparin’ it for the next tenant, he’s
coming in tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: God damn it, god damn it… Yes, I’ll wait,
I’m waiting… I don’t believe this. They can’t do this to me!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Barnes? It’s my diary! They stole my
fucking diary! Find it, will you? Find it! God damn it, that’s my
life!</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Never. Never again. I swear, I swear I
will never work with this broad –</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: You’re four hours late! It’s insane! It’s
unprofessional!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’d say I’m behaving as professionally as
anyone else in this town.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Where were you?!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Terribly, terribly sorry; I overslept.
What’s the name of this fine entertainment we’re all so involved in?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh yes. “No Escape.” That’s it. There’s no
escape.</p>
<p><strong>tora</strong>: It’s about time! You’re not the star on this
show, y’know!</p>
<p><strong>tora</strong>: Of course, it’s not up to me to say anything.
I’m just crew… Y’know, you hair’s so fine you’ll lose it if you’re not
careful. Wonder you all don’t, the things you do to yourselves. In fact,
I think you are already… Fact, I think you better –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: That’s it! I’m not taking this any more! I
quit!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Goodbye!… goodbye!… goodbye!…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What the hell’s going on here? Hold on!
Hello… Hello?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What…? Help!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Mama, help me, help me, Mama! Don’t let
them kill me!</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Get your clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You have no right! You have no fucking
right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here –</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Get your clothes on, lady –</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t believe this! You jerks drag me
down here in the middle of the night and you don’t even know who the
hell I am!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Age?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Address?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Just put me down as a avg – a vagrant
vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched
that bitch!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Occupation?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Cocksucker.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Hey! I’d like to leave a wake-up call for
say, ten? Hey! I’ll have my bread and water in bed!</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Hey Frances! Why don’t you comb your
hair, okay?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …Take me the way I am.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: …Is that not true?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Who’s writing this guy’s lines?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Answer the question! Have you driven a car
since you were placed on probation?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, I couldn’t get my hands on one.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Have you reported to your Probation Officer
as directed?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I never saw him. Why didn’t he show up?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Did you expect him to look you up?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at
his face…</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You’re on your way to a contempt citation,
young lady.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: That’s fine with me… Get it? Fine. A fine!
Hey c’mon, c’mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Miss Farmer, is it true you fought with the
policeman who arrested you last night?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Sure it’s true. I was fighting for my
country as well as myself.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Miss Farmer, you were advised at the last
hearing that if you took one drink of liquor or failed to be a
law-abiding citizen –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Are you telling me you didn’t have a little
rum in your pineapple juice this morning? I can smell it from here, Your
Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: That’s enough!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It’s the truth! I can smell it from here –
you old hypocrite!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: Miss Farmer! In light of your flagrant
disregard for the conditions of your probation, coupled with the
unwarranted assault on the Plaintiff here… I am forced to order you to
begin serving a sentence of 180 days in the County Jail.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Fine!</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: You are a deeply troubled young lady… I only
hope you change your course before it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Wait a minute… I haven’t got a lawyer…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What I want to know is do I have any civil
rights?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I want to make a phone call…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I have a right to make a phone call!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: “The kleig-lighted road to fame and
fortune is strewn with heartbreak and despair. Today film star Frances
Farmer, tarnished by alcohol and drugs” – ’m I going too fast for
ya?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: They’re stealing my civil rights! Help me!
I’m being kidnapped! Oh God, help me! Help me!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Haven’t you ever had a broken heart?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Oh my God, she’s loose!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: She’s attacking your correspondent! Right
here in the Court Building! Good God, this bitch is crazy! Someone stop
her!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Harry!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I have a right! I have a right!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: With what must surely be the final act of
madness, the curtain falls on Frances Farmer’s once promising career.
The crazed blonde who at 27…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Hold it a second, Bub…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: …and we feel that this would be more
appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>judge</strong>: …a difficult decision, but, I’m sure, the
proper one.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: It’s alright now, little sister,
everything’s going to be just fine.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Mama, what’s…</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Shhh, shhh. You’re not going to jail,
Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I’ll see you get the rest
you need.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You’re taking me home!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: First things first, little sister. Trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Why it’s beautiful here! What a view!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Good afternoon, Miss Farmer. I’m
Dr. Symington.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Good afternoon, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: I’m very pleased to meet you,
Mrs. Farmer. I’m sure we’ll have more of a chance to talk later. Right
now I think it’s important that your daughter have a chance to settle
in. Perhaps it would be best if you said your goodbyes here.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh. Well, I have some background that you
should probably know about if you’re…</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: I have no doubt, Mrs. Farmer. If you’ll
speak to the girl at the desk, she’ll arrange an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’ll be back real soon, little sister. You
be a good girl.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Mama!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …I want to go home, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You’ll see, little sister. Everything will
be fine. The doctors know best.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: I find these initial meetings to be much
easier without the concerned relatives in attendance.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Am I supposed to say ‘thank you’?</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Thanks are hardly necessary.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Aw, shucks, ma’am. T’weren’t nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: I’m glad to see you haven’t lost your
sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It ain’t for lack of trying.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: So it seems. May we be serious for a
moment?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Why, Doctor! We’ve only just met!</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: I feel I’ve known you for a long time…
you see, I’ve followed your career… you’re a fascinating case… I’m
looking forward to resolving your predicament.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh! Are you really?</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Among persons such as yourself, creative
people under great stress, erratic behavior is not at all uncommon and
certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It’s just that the neuroses which
fuel your talent can also generate certain character disabilities
which…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Do you expect me, for one moment, to
believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Please sit down…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You
may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I’m not
interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a
veternarian.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Besides, I don’t want to be what you want
to make me.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: And what’s that?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Normal. Average.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: All right. Will you please sit down now?
Symington says.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …Did you really say that?</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Just a little joke, Miss Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: This whole thing is a joke!</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Stay calm, please.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you’re
finding that difficult, aren’t you? Why, are you attracted to me?
Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions… after we know each
other a little better… and you’ve torn my personality to shreds, and I’m
weeping and vulnerable… then you’ll really get your kicks, won’t you,
“Doctor?”</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: I’ll have someone show you to your
room.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh, that’s good, very professional. In
control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you
away.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: You really should get some rest now.
Nurse will meet you outside. Good day.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Is there something else?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You didn’t say ‘Symington says’.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Symington says.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Not much on hospital corners, are you?</p>
<p><strong>matron</strong>: You Farmer?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: So this is the nuthouse…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Honey… take my word for it. This is a
resort.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You have no right!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That’s
Amelia Earhart!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But what is it?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You’ve got to tell me what it is!</p>
<p><strong>thin nurse</strong>: It’s insulin. It throws your body into
shock.</p>
<p><strong>nurse with hypo</strong>: It’s just vitamins.</p>
<p><strong>nurse with hypo</strong>: A, C, B-Complex, certain minerals…
Just stay relaxed… Good, now open your mouth a sec.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: …and here’s the one from Duluth. A war
widow with five children. She works in a defense plant and she’s very
worried about you. I answered her that she shouldn’t let worry over you
affect her vital work; and that you’d be back on the silver screen in no
time.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: And here’s one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says
that…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Why are these all opened?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Well, they needed immediate answers,
Frances. It’s good manners and good sense. You shouldn’t be bothering
yourself with these right now.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Then why did you bring them?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: It’s your fan mail, little sister.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You kill me, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Go on…</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: …I’m sorry to keep you waiting, the staff
review ran over. Did you enjoy your mother’s visit?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yes. It was very good to see her.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Really? Any problems?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Not at all. She brought me my fan mail. I
had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess
that’s the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many
friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me
wasn’t a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: You’re telling me you feel guilty.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No… What I mean is… I’m just very excited
by the prospect of getting on with my life, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Do you really believe your mother’s
trying to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: She told me you said, “Mama, you want to
kill me.”</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I never said… Oh look. That’s just a figure
of speech. She said something funny, and I said…</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: And you accused her of tampering with
your mail.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh for Christ’s…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m sorry. She misunderstood, that’s
all.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: But you tell me you had a pleasant visit
and your mother says you were sullen and uncommunicative. Whom do you
think I should believe?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my
mother is a little batty.</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Frances, you’re still filled with
anxiety. You feel guilty and hostile toward your family and friends.
Consequently, I didn’t recommend your release at the staff review.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Mental illness is an elusive thing, and
though I’m pleased you’re feeling more… capable, it’s perhaps
unrealistic to expect you to be completely cured after so short a time.
Don’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: I’m sure you’ll see it my way in the
end.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: ’Cause if it’s long enough, which I doubt,
why don’t you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I want outta here, you understand? I’m
ready to get out! So you go back there… you go back and you tell them to
let me out!</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Frances, I’m warning you…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, I’m warning you! Who do you think you
are, God? You bumble around with your folders… …and your pencils… …and
your god-damn buttons… …all your badges of authority! But you have no
authority! You’re nothing! You’re a zero!</p>
<p><strong>orderly</strong>: Doc?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Symington says…</p>
<p><strong>symington</strong>: Sedate her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hi there. How ’bout a walk in the woods?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh my God, I look awful.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’ve looked a whole lot better. C’mon.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: They’re doin’ stuff to me, Harry. Can you
see it? You feel it? They’re putting stuff in my food or something, my
water, and they’re using it to put thoughts in my head. You understand?
They’re trying to re- arrange what’s in my head, they’re trying to drive
me crazy! Oh, Harry!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I can’t stay here anymore, you understand?
I can’t, I can’t. I gotta get home. I gotta get somewhere else,
anywhere, okay?</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Oh, Miss Farmer! Time for your bath, Miss
Farmer!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Listen: to the left. Straight through the
trees and over the wall to your left. My car is there.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: It’s time for your bath!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh good. I love my baths.</p>
<p><strong>attendant</strong>: Come along now.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frances! Did you hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Of course, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Over the walls!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You want crazy? I’ll show you crazy!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Evening, gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: That sure looks like fun… You know how long
it’s been since I was behind the wheel?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Forget it, Frances. You’re not driving.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Have I told you how mean you’re turning,
York?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Where are we, mean man?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Couple hours from Idaho. We’ll cut across to
Montana. I’ve got friends there with a ranch.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I should’ve known…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: This is another one of your schemes to get
me off alone…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …Take advantage of me.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t think I’d be much good in a
war…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Whattaya think you’re in now?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t know. Not a war exactly. It’s more
a… a misapprehension maybe…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong
meaning from things. I wasn’t declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my
prayers.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who to?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to
Mama.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frances, you’re fulla drugs. You don’t know
what you’re saying. Who do you think put you into Meadow Wood? Your
mother thinks you’re crazy and she’ll keep on thinking it as long as it
suits her.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, she just didn’t want me going to jail,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah? She’s a shark, Frances. I’m not taking
you there, and that’s that!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You know something, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Aside from meanness, you’re almost perfect.
There’s only one other thing wrong with you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You can’t drink.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Ohhh, that’s lousy Scotch!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey! Another shot for the lady and a double
for me!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What a man!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey, you’re a good quarter-horse, kid, but
you can’t go a route of ground.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: To quarter-horses.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. To thoroughbreds.</p>
<p><strong>bing’s voice</strong>: Love is so terrific Such a funny
feeling Makes you want to cuddle And coo…</p>
<p><strong>bing &amp; harry</strong>: Makes you sentimental, Makes you
kinda gentle Ouch! Terrific thing.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Why are you always leaving me, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You should stickaround sometimes. Look out
for me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, Frances, I’m only gonna ask this one
time. I mean it. I swear after this, I’ll never ask again: Will you
marry me?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I know a thing or two about marriage. You…
you understand me more than anyone, Harry… maybe even more than Mama.
But… you’re too important to me. I’d fail you. I don’t know how or why,
but I would. And that’s a chance I just can’t take. Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Well… I’ll act like I do until I do.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: There’s just one more thing.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s not too late to keep going, up to
Vancouver? Be the smartest thing.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thanks, Harry, really, but… I can’t explain
it. She’s my mother. She’s just… I can’t give up on her that easy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You give up on her?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah. It’s just… something I gotta do, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frances, You’re crazy.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I know. Don’t tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Anyway… if you need me…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I got your number, Mister Man.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Welcome home, little sister.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well, who have we here…?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma
Styles?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Hello, Frances. You seem to be having quite
a time of it.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I called Alma because I think we’ll
need…</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Frances, the doctors at Meadow Wood have
petitioned the court for your return. Your mother has asked me to
intervene so you can stay here.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I swear I didn’t know what they were doing
to you. I wouldn’t have let them…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It’s okay, Mama. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: You realize, of course, your mother is now
your legal guardian. In the eyes of the law, you no longer have any
rights as an adult. You’re going to have to hold your tongue and be
selective about whom you mix with. That man who drove you here, for
instance –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You leave him out of this!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Frances, please don’t…</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Never mind. We won’t have to worry about him
much longer.</p>
<p><strong>fbi man</strong>: How ya doin’, Al?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You got the wrong guy. Name’s Slocum.</p>
<p><strong>fbi man</strong>: No, it ain’t. And it ain’t Harry York,
neither.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look, I’m tellin’ you…</p>
<p><strong>fbi man</strong>: I’d give you till ten, Al, but we ain’t got
the time.</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: Alvin Hanson, a.k.a. Ronald Burns, Thomas
Slocum, Harry York… Mr. Hanson, this warrant has been outstanding for
many years. Normally that circumstance would prompt me toward leniency,
but the crime you committed – inciting to riot – and the cause you
sought to promote – a worker’s rebellion – are such anathemas to this
court that I feel compelled to mete out the full sentence. I only wish
it were longer. Six months in the state penitentiary.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Frances, play ‘Flow Gently Sweet
Afton’.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh Mama, I’m so… tired of that song.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Please. I want you to. It would make me so
happy.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: It’s just a flow gently sweet Afton day.
Life has been so good to me. Why, I have just about everything one could
wish… but I still have so many blank pages in my scrapbook.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I think I need a little air.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Nothing. I think I’ll just go out for
awhile.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: How long will you be?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Not long.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I’ll have lunch ready by one.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: At one. Promise?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Say you promise.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I promise I’ll… I promise, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You know, the surest way to lose an
appetite, is to drink, little sister.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yes, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I don’t want you drinking, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yes, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …So what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: I don’t know, honey. Your mother has such
big plans for you.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I know that, Dad, but –</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: What you have to understand, Francie, is
that she… well… she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she
never really got to… The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name
was in the papers… but she could have been… if times were different she
could have been a politician or… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But Dad, I’m asking about me. What do you
think I should do?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your
hands on something you want, it just doesn’t look the same. Then you
have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it’s
all you’ve got… or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I
guess you already know that.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Dad… whatever I decide, will it be okay
with you?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Always. Always.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: I’m sorry, I… I don’t have a desk in my
room, and…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t care, Dad. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: I love you too, Francie.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m back, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess
who –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell
you. I’ve decided… well… I’m not going to make movies anymore. I thought
that’s what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you
taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now…
now it’s over. I want a different kind of life, something… simple. I
want to live someplace quiet and peaceful… in the country maybe, and
I’ll have dogs and cats – I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the
first time in… It’s going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Don’t… talk crazy.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Mama…?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: They want you back! Your agent called
today! Don’t you understand? He’s sending the scripts. He wants to fly
up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can’t do this
to your fans! Why, they’ve been praying for you all through this
nightmare. You can’t turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail
I’ve been answering!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Haven’t you heard what I said?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I told him to come up! I told him you
wanted to show them all that there’s nothing wrong with you any more,
that you’re completely cured!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m not cured. I was never sick! They had
no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself
now!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You… you selfish, selfish child. At least
talk to him, hear what he has to say.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You want to throw it all away, is that it?
You had everything, little sister. Beauty… a brilliant career… a
wonderful husband. You were a movie star!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Mama, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: And now you’re throwing everything away?
You’re gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that’s like?!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You… You’d send me back, wouldn’t you? You
would.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m going out!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You’re not going anywhere!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yes, I am, and you can’t stop me! You can’t
tell me what to do, mother. I’m a grown woman, and I can decide about my
own life.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Frances!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Don’t you try and stop me. Don’t you
dare!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: If you follow me, Mama, I swear I’ll
fucking kill you!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: That’s it. You’ve done it now, little
sister.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: All my life, I’ve tried to live up to my
parents’ example. To have the independence of mind and fortitude of
spirit that have made this country great. I taught that to Frances:
Speak out. Aspire. Make something of yourself, something –</p>
<p><strong>dr. doyle</strong>: Yes, yes, Mrs. Farmer –</p>
<p><strong>alma styles</strong>: Frances has always been a battleground,
Lillian.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: The point is: it’s your opinion that Frances
is getting steadily worse?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Well… yes.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: And you feel you’re unable to control her any
longer?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: No… I mean, yes, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: And the only course open to you is to commit
your daughter for a period of time to a mental institution?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Well, Alma told me that…</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: …Yes.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I believe that’s all I need to know about
Miss Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: I think in all future documents she should
be referred to as Mrs. R. H. Richardson.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Her married name?</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: Yes. It’s less recognizable. I’m sure you’d
prefer to keep unpleasant publicity to a minimum.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: …Oh yes.</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: Now. Can you tell us where we might find
Frances?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …Looking for a drink, and the town is
deserted, he can’t understand it. Finally he finds a bar, goes in – the
place is empty, bartender’s closing up. Salesman says, ‘Gimme a
martini.’ Bartender’s real nervous, he says, ‘No, no, no, I gotta close.
Big Otis is coming to town.’</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Salesman says, ‘I don’t care. I gotta have
a martini.’ So the bartender fixes him a martini real fast, grabs his
money, and runs out the back. Salesman sits there sipping his martini,…
he’s got the bar all to himself… Then he hears it. This big roaring in
the street.</p>
<p><strong>rrraaaaaaa!!!</strong>: Gigantic footsteps… coming closer.
Stopping.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Enormous hands reach in, grab the swinging
doors and rip them off their hinges. This huge man stomps in. Picks up a
chair and hurls it over the bar, smashing the mirror – whiskey and glass
flying everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: He turns to the salesman: ‘What the hell’re
you doing in here!’ Salesman says, ‘I’m just drinking a martini.’ ‘Oh
yeah?’ the guy says. ‘Well you better get outa here! Big Otis is coming
to town!’</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: …From her history, it’s apparent the patient
suffers from a paranoid reaction with pronounced egotism. Her violent
responses have recently included aggression against her mother. In view
of the deep-seated nature of her ailments and her failure to respond
satisfactorily to insulin shock, it is my opinion she may ultimately
require permanent institutional care.</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: Counsellor, as Guardian ad litem for
Mrs. Richardson, do you waive jury trial?</p>
<p><strong>styles</strong>: Yes, your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: Having heard the testimony of a legally
qualified and reputable physician… and being further satisfied of the
truth of all matters set forth in the certificates of said physician, I
do hereby order that the said Mrs. R. H. Richardson, an insane person,
be confined to the Western State Hospital for the Insane at
Steilacoom.</p>
<p><strong>hillier</strong>: So ordered! Are the gentlemen from
Steilacoom present?</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: What’s she getting, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>doctor #2</strong>: Standard series to start.</p>
<p><strong>doctor #1</strong>: Fifteen?</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Can I push the button on this one?</p>
<p><strong>doctor #2</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe
I’ve profited from my stay here. It’s just what I’ve needed, to get away
like this. But I’m recuperated now. I’ve had lots of time to think and
I’ve made a few decisions about my life. I’m ready to get on with
it.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I know you believe that.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: I’m afraid not. You see, we observe things
that you’re unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep,
Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get
out, you’ll really feel secure. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know
better.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance,
the anger in your voice.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You… I’m sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me
honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: Be patient, that’s all. Take an interest in
your treatment and don’t dwell on your resentments. You’ll be yourself
again, I assure you.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …I see.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We’ll talk more about this. I’ll see you
later.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: One question. If I’m not myself now, just
who do you think I am?</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We’ll talk.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: What the hell!</p>
<p><strong>chant</strong>: Come and get it! Come and get it! Come and
get it!</p>
<p><strong>chant</strong>: We want Frances! We want Frances!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Come and get it…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frances! Frances!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frances, it’s me, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …Touch me again and I’ll kill you, you
pig.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Watch out, Harry. Let me look her over.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, God! Let’s get her out of here tonight,
right now! Let’s take her with us!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The hearing’s tomorrow. If she gets out
legally, they can’t come after her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look at her! She’ll never pass that sanity
test tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m taking care of that, Harry. Just hold
her. Reserpine. I guarantee you this’ll clear her head. She’ll wake up
feeling smart and sailright through the hearing.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yeah… she knows about these. Shut her
up.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’ll be okay, honey. He’s just givin’ you
something to make you think, so that tomorrow you can tell ’em what they
want to hear, okay? Tell ’em you were crazy as a loon and they cured you
and you’re grateful.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: This stuff takes pretty quick. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Please! Take me!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Let’s get out of here! I’ll lose my job!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frances, we gotta do it this way. Just
remember tomorrow, remember what I told you. What’re you gonna tell
’em?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m grateful… grateful.</p>
<p><strong>women in ward</strong>: I’m grateful! I’m grateful!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Harry!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I gotta go now.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Harry, please!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: We’re all square now, Harry. Right?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: All square, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Good. ’Cause I don’t want to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I love you, Harry. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I love you too, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I realize now that I was a very sick
woman.</p>
<p><strong>women in ward</strong>: Sick! She’s sick!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I couldn’t relate to others in a normal
way.</p>
<p><strong>one patient</strong>: She’s… not… normal…!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: And I was not taking responsibility for my
actions. But now, thanks to your treatment, I feel ready to face myself,
ready to resume the career which I so single-handedly shattered. I only
hope… I hope I can make you all proud of me. Thank you. Thank you so
much.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Of course, she hasn’t anything definite in
mind.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No. No, it all depends on what offers I
get.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Who did your hair, Frances?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well, I like to try different styles.
Sometimes if you’re old-fashioned enough, you find you’re modern. Right,
Mama?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: What do you think of all this,
Mrs. Farmer?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: It’s a miracle. Just a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Oh, just leave those things for now.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, Mama, I’ll take care of it. I’ll wash
them in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You know, little sister, I never resented
you for refusing to see me in the… the hospital. I knew you had to
manage on your own before you could come back.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thank you for understanding, Mama.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Little sister, I don’t want you to feel any
rush to get back to work. I want you to rest… for a while anyway.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I will, I promise.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Good night, dear.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh Harry…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: This is it, kid. This is our chance. When you
got a chance, you better take it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You don’t need to screw around anymore. You
don’t need Dwayne Steele or Odets or your mother. You need me.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I know, but… There were so many people in
there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against
me… watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking
things into me. When I feel somebody near me now… anybody… my skin
starts to crawl.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You can’t change the things they did to me,
Harry. Only I can do that… by myself.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Been a lot of years, you know. A long time
waiting. For what? End up feeling like a sap.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh please, Harry… don’t even think it.
You’re the only person who ever… It’s just… Can’t you wait for me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yes you do. If you love me you can wait,
right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Right. Except… time has a way of –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, Harry, it’s not time, it’s us. You and
me. And I’m telling you now that I’ll come to you, okay? I’ll find you.
I will.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I hope so, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’ll be seeing you, kid.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Pretty morning.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It’s always beautiful at this time.
Peaceful…</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: And no people.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Where you goin’?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Wherever they’re going, I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Yeah, I know what that’s like… Where you
been?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant
workers until…</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: They’re looking for you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: What’d you do?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You know, I’ve never been able to figure
that out.</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: I’ve got a little whiskey here, warm you
up.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Wait. Maybe they’ll pick you up.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>hitchhiker</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Dad…? Why don’t you stop at a side road and
let me out?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Francie, you know I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Why? It’s such a simple thing. You just let
me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me
again.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: They’ll just catch you again, Francie.
Besides, your mother will know.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Dad, here! You don’t have to stop, just
slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that’s the kind of
thing I’d do. She won’t blame you.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: But I gave her my word. Besides, she’s still
your legal guardian. My hands are tied.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You know where you’re taking me. You know
what she’ll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for
once in your life, please?</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Please, Francie…</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: I’ll try to protect you, Francie. I will,
I’ll talk to her. We’ll have a real talk.</p>
<p><strong>ernest</strong>: Are you… are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Do I go right away or do I have time to
take a bath?</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I was hoping for a kind word, little
sister.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You were hoping for a kind word?! You’re my
mother! You’re supposed to nourish me! Support me!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: I have!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No! All you’ve done is try to break my
spirit, try to turn me into you! But I’m not you, mother, and I never
will be, and thank god for it! That goes for you too! And frankly, I
don’t know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am – Wait
right there, gentlemen, I’ll be with you in a minute… and believe me, I
don’t want to stay here one second longer than I have to! But I’ve got
to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what
you’ve done and hang your head in shame. In shame!</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: But what –</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No! You’re not talking now. You listen. You
can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I’m crazy and pretend I’m
still your little girl who can’t take care of herself, but one thing you
can’t pretend anymore. You can’t pretend I love you because I don’t. I
can’t. Not after what you’ve done to me. Because you see… I’m still me…
I’m trying real hard all this time to be me… and you, ‘little sister’,
you haven’t been any help at all. Okay, boys, I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: We shall hear the angels, we shall see the
whole sky all diamonds…</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: …Best deal I ever made. Twenty bucks to
fuck a fuckin’ movie star.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #2</strong>: Yeah, it’s worth it I guess.</p>
<p><strong>soldier #1</strong>: What’s she saying, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>soldier #2</strong>: Who knows. She’s crazy, ain’t she?</p>
<p><strong>older nurse</strong>: I don’t know why they even bother.
She’s had enough of this to knock sense into a bull elephant.</p>
<p><strong>young nurse</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>older nurse</strong>: I checked the files. This one holds the
record for shock treatments. Four hundred seventeen and no end in
sight.</p>
<p><strong>young nurse</strong>: You’re kidding.</p>
<p><strong>older nurse</strong>: Yeah, well, you know doctors. They sure
hate to use that word.</p>
<p><strong>young nurse</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>older nurse</strong>: ‘Incurable.’</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you’d come. I love
you, Harry. I love… Take me home, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>doyle</strong>: We’ll get you home, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thank you, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>dr. harlington</strong>: One merely inserts the leucotome
beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating
it so as to sever the nervous connections between the thalamofrontal
radiation and the body of the brain.</p>
<p><strong>dr. harlington</strong>: Because of the speed and simplicity
of the operation, I am able, as you are seeing, to perform the procedure
on ten patients in less than a half hour.</p>
<p><strong>dr. harlington</strong>: The operation is completely painless
and can be performed without any sedative whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>dr. harlington</strong>: We have always known that this form
of radical treatment was effective, but until now it couldn’t be applied
on a large scale. The old procedure required a full day’s work by a
surgical team to perform a single operation. In the same time, working
alone, I can treat fifty.</p>
<p><strong>dr. harlington</strong>: This procedure works best on
patients with extreme over-reactions to emotional stimuli. It can also
be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of
treatment.</p>
<p><strong>dr. harlington</strong>: In plain language, my technique
severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas. Along with the
cure comes a loss of affect… a kind of emotional flattening…</p>
<p><strong>dr. harlington</strong>: …with diminished creativity and
imagination. Patients become like good solid cake with no icing. But,
after all, it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed.</p>
<p><strong>dr. harlington</strong>: These patients will soon be leaving
the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>dr. harlington</strong>: Lobotomy gets ’em home.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: What was I saying? Oh yes, it was the
Communists that did it to Frances.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: They capture the mind by first seducing the
heart. I suppose I never taught Frances to close her heart…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Uh… excuse us, Mrs. Farmer. We’re going to
have to… uh…</p>
<p><strong>third reporter</strong>: Yeah, I better pack it in too.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: Pardon? Oh, would you like more
lemonade?</p>
<p><strong>fourth reporter</strong>: I think we’ve had enough. Thank
you, Mrs. Farmer. Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>lillian</strong>: You know, Ernie, I think we should have
Frances’ room repainted for when she comes home. That’ll brighten her
day.</p>
<p><strong>fade in on</strong>: A TELEVISION SCREEN against a dark
background The show is “This Is Your Life”. We SEE a smiling RALPH
EDWARDS, reading from a large black book. Next to him stands Frances.
She has aged dramatically, but is still a very handsome woman. She seems
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: …Dwayne Steele divorced you, and from this
point on, your story takes a darker turn. Shunned by the Hollywood you
criticized so harshly, alienated from your family and friends, you turn
your back on professional commitments in New York, and alcohol and drugs
enter your life. These are sad, desperate times for you.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: …until finally your mother finds it
necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. Were you mentally
ill, Frances?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: …No, Ralph. I don’t believe I ever was
sick. But when you’re treated like a patient long enough, you’re apt to
act like one…</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Were you an alcoholic?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Were you a drug addict?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No. Never.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: …and over 200 producers have been invited
to watch your appearance here tonight… so who knows, Frances Farmer,
anything’s possible on your comeback trail! And since your friends tell
me they have to drive you everywhere, look what we’ve got for you!</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: A brand new 1958 Edsel!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Thank you, Ralph.</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: Thank you, Frances. And after the show
we’re hosting a reception for you and your friends at Hollywood’s own
Roosevelt Hotel!</p>
<p><strong>edwards</strong>: So, Frances Farmer, this is your life. Good
night. God bless you.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Where shall we drop you, Frances? Home?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No… no, someone’s picking me up.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: C’mere. I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How… how ya doin’, Farmer?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Fine, thank you. Did you watch the
show?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sure I did, that’s why I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: How did I look?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, you… …ennh.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: does not pick up on</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I got a new car. Only it’s red. Did you
know Mama died?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Dad, too. I sold the house. I’m a faceless
sinner, Harry…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why do you say that?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I’d ask you to take me home, but I’m a
faceless sinner. …You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I’d ask you
to take me home, but…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Frances!</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Don’t get mad at me, Harry. Please. It’s
just… Some things happen for the best.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It’s going to be slow from now on. Do you
know what I mean, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Very slow. But we’re not going to stop, are
we?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, we’re not.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you
again.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes. Would you like me to walk a little way
with you?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: That would be okay.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Just a little way.</p>
