<p><strong>judit</strong>: The Door of Alcala has also darkened.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Mateo, say something!</p>
<p><strong>mateo-harry</strong>: Mateo is dead.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Don’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>off harry</strong>: I always wanted to be another person, to
be someone beside myself. To dispose of a single identity didn’t seem
enough. Living a single life wasn’t enough for me. And half-joking, I
came up with a pseudonym for myself, Harry Caine, an adventurer who, as
fate would have it, became a writer. At that time, I had him author all
the scripts and stories that I wrote. I came up with a standard
biography to fill the back flap of his books. He had been a sailor, an
industrial spy, the doorman at a Parisian cabaret, a boxer, a waiter and
an advertisement hand-double. A self-made man, active and attractive
like an English spy, vital, skeptical and sarcastic. For many years,
Mateo Blanco and Harry Caine shared the same person, me, but a time came
when, all of a sudden, I couldn’t be anyone other than Harry Caine. I
became my pseudonym. we first see him in front of it, and then, doubled,
reflected in it. Then, suddenly, the mirror does not reflect him. Of his
two identities he only has one . Just as I had planned, a heterodox
writer and, never better stated, a self-made man, one might even say,
“self-written man”. There was only one detail I had not foreseen, Harry
would be a blind writer.</p>
<p><strong>waiter friend</strong>: Do you want me to read you something
from the newspaper?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, thanks. I am off on a stroll.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Watch out! You can’t cross!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Sorry . . .</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’ll tell you when!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I live nearby, two blocks up, would you mind
coming along with me?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You will only have to browse.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Do you mind if I turn on the light? So that I
can read… It’s too dark in here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, yes… Turn the light on…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ernesto Martel is dead!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Ernesto Martel. I know one of his
granddaughters…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: So he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You knew him?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What are you interested in, politics, economy…
culture?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I am interested in you. What are you like? Do
you mind describing yourself?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: What are you laughing at?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I am only smiling, because of the way you’re
looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I must go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thanks for helping me cross.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I’m sorry, I thought you were alone.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She helped me cross the street and I invited
her in to read me the newspaper . . .</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Harry, you can’t bring into your house the
first person who helps you across the street. One of these days
something awful will happen to you!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Everything awful that’s had to happen to me
has. Now, all that’s left is for me to enjoy life . . .</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Diego told me yesterday that you finished the
script.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I would like to add a final epilogue. It may
not be necessary, but I’d like to write it.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I agreed to deliver the definitive version to
the producer and director today.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You will have it by tomorrow, don’t
worry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ernesto Martel has died.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I think he was very ill…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s been so long since we’ve spoken of
him!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: You look awful …!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I ran here.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And it’s Monday! Diego, you don’t have to run
for me. We are not in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I am, I’ve committed …</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You’ll have it by tonight, don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Start thinking of the next script. Some kind
of horror or fantasy story for bratty teenagers. It’s what sells best
…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know if I’ll know how to. I was
thinking of developing a story inspired by Arthur Miller’s son…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: The writer who married Marilyn?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: And Miller never saw him? …</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: One day, Miller was giving a conference in
defense of a mentally retarded man, who had been condemned to death,
after what was believed to be a forced confession. Among those present
was his mentally handicapped son, who was integrally involved with
organizations that aided all sorts of disabled people. The son was very
proud to finally be sharing something with his father. At the end of the
conference, he approached the stage and held him in an embrace that must
have seemed endless to Arthur Miller, who did not know how to extract
himself from this mentally handicapped man; imagine, it would not have
been politically correct, least of all given the situation in which
Miller found himself. Then the stranger let go of him and told him: “I
am</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: It’s very moving, but I don’t think we can
write a script about Arthur Miller without procuring rights from the
family.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We change the names, the story is not about
the writer’s miserliness, but about the strength of the son who survives
without the least bit of rancor toward the father who has ignored him
his entire life. It is a story of troubles overcome and of inherent
goodness. There aren’t those many good men that one can write about.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: It’s a beautiful story. But years ago, when
you began writing again and I began selling your scripts, you told me
you’d never write remakes, sequels, nor biopics. Nor stories whose
protagonists were film</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I can’t bear them… It’s true, it’s true I
said all that, but this wouldn’t exactly be a biopic…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Diego, go to the end of the document.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Did you bring me the session?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s still warm. Just downloaded from the
eMule.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Dude. I’ll throw it in now. You want
something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Yes. And you, would you like a tip of
“crystal”?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I pass. I do need to sleep once in a
while.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: You need anything?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: What are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was going to read an Alice Munro story on
the MP3.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Then I’ll leave you. I’ll stop by tomorrow,
when I can. I have to finish the budget for the Americans as soon as
possible, so that I can decide what to do … . Ok, we can continue
tommorow…</p>
<p><strong>off</strong>: Ernesto Martel has passed away at his residence
in the countryside, “La Berzosa.” Financier, of Chilean origin, who
achieved great success and notoriety due to his involvement in the
financing of crucial public infrastructures in different Latin American
countries.</p>
<p><strong>off</strong>: Recently he had been involved in various
financial scandals. He was implicated for fraud in the infamous “case of
Bank Banelco”. He was married three times, and had two children…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: … I just spoke to the Transportation
Minister. Things are in full swing. Yes, we are doing the Caracas</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: I will dictate a letter for the Minister of
Industry…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>magdalena</strong>: Yes, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: Why don’t you tell me what’s wrong? I’m
sure I could help you.</p>
<p><strong>magdalena</strong>: My father is very ill. This afternoon
they are releasing him and I wanted to ask you if I could leave an hour
early to go pick him and my mother up.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: Of course. What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>magdalena</strong>: Stomach cancer, metastasized.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: I am really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I can’t believe they have thrown you out of
the hospital, like dogs…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Yes, honey, yes…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Does Dr. Alvaro de la Torre know this?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He’s been the one…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: But how? If he was going to operate him this
week, and last week, and the other week…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: It cannot be! They can’t keep him for twenty
days, torturing him with tests in preparation for an operation and now
leave him like this, just because the doctor is leaving on vacation!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Have you protested?…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: To who? Dr. De la Torre is the head surgeon.
There is no one over him.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Did you forget about me?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: How could you think that Dad!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You know what Dr. De la Torre told me before
he broke the news?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You tell her, Paca.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He said: I am glad you are not still in the
service, Emilio.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: “Because if you were still in the service,
after what I am going to tell you, you’d shoot me…”</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: He really said that?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Yes… and he was smiling, he thought it was
funny…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Call me any time, no matter what it is!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Madame Mylene? Hello, it’s Severine.</p>
<p><strong>madame mylene</strong>: Severine! It’s been so long! I’m so
happy to hear from you.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I need money.</p>
<p><strong>madame severine</strong>: How soon?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Now! My weekend’s free. I am busy during the
week.</p>
<p><strong>madame mylene</strong>: I’ll see what I can do. May I call
tonight if I find something?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yes. I’ll wait for your call.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>off ernesto martel</strong>: Severine?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto martel</strong>: I am calling on Madame Mylene’s
behalf.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You’ve made a mistake, sir. No Severine lives
here.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto martel</strong>: I must have dialed wrong. Excuse
me.</p>
<p><strong>madame</strong>: Hi! Has he already called?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>madame</strong>: The client! You will not complain about my
speediness!</p>
<p><strong>madame</strong>: I couldn’t say no.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Things aren’t done like that! Have you gone
mad!?</p>
<p><strong>madame</strong>: He knows everything. And I haven’t been the
one to tell him, he found out on his own account, he knows about your
foray into acting, and that you sometimes “acted” for me…</p>
<p><strong>madame</strong>: Months ago he made me promise him that if
you got back in contact with me I would call him. I couldn’t say no, he
is one of my best clients.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You bitch!</p>
<p><strong>madame</strong>: Look on the bright side. He must really like
you to go to the lengths he has… Perhaps you’ve found your Sugar
Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>madame</strong>: What have you agreed on? Remember I am part
of the business.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: How is Dad?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Not well at all, my dear. We’ve been through
a hellish night. He has not eaten anything. But he won’t stop bleeding…
and everything is coming up… it’s as if he has burst inside.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I will be there with an ambulance immediately.
Be ready to leave!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Mr. Martel? It’s Lena.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: Good morning, Lena.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I am sorry to bother you…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: You are never a bother.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: My father is dying. We must admit him
urgently, but I don’t know where. As I told you, they released him from
Puerta de Hierro yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: Don’t worry. We will take him to the
Emergency Room at a private clinic. You told me that he has stomach
cancer…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: The best digestive surgeon in Europe is at
the Clinica de la Luz. I will take care of the admittance issue. Call an
ambulance and tell them to pick up your parents. I’ll meet you at the
Clinica de la Luz in an hour…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: How’s the patient?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: You have brought him in terrible
conditions… Which I suppose you know.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: Will you be able to save him?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: We will do everything possible… at this
very moment it is impossible to operate…</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Perhaps tomorrow. We are providing
parenteral nutrition… He will need a blood transfusion… Do you have any
relatives who can donate?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Well, here… I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: Give him the best blood you’ve got!</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: I will keep you updated on his condition in
the next hours…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: May I stay?</p>
<p><strong>surgeon</strong>: Yes, of course. You can stay in his room as
long as you wish.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I’ll stay here, Mom. You have to rest…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No, you rest… You’ve already done enough…
Thank you very much, Mr. Ernesto. If my husband survives, it will be
thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: He will survive, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Really, you don’t want me to stay? Or that I
bring you something?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No, go. You both must have things to do…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: I’m Ray X …</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ray X? There’s no such a name.</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: It’s a nickname, at one time I took a lot of
ecstasy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: To write a script with you, so that I can
direct it.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s your first film?</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: I made a documentary … a very good one,
eighteen years ago, this would be my first fiction film.</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: You are naked?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Will you stand there all day?</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: You haven’t given me Judit Garcia’s phone
number.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Find it out. She is a well-known Production
Director.</p>
<p><strong>off judit</strong>: Hi Harry. It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>off judit</strong>: A young director has been in contact with
me. His name is Ray X and he wants to write a script with you… Does this
ring a bell?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes… .</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Well, he wants to see you this afternoon, or
tomorrow, if you can. I have asked him for an advance and he has
accepted, but I cannot accompany you either today or tomorrow…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I will speak to him… and let you know.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Good, I hope you like him, he seems to be
loaded.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Have you seen him?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: No, just judging from his voice. And from the
check I am about to ask him for. I will send Diego over so that you’re
not alone.</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: Hi, I’m Ray X.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Hello Mr. X. Please, have a seat…</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: Please, don’t address me formally.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I love your work, I know it from the start.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I have seen all of Mateo Blanco’s films,
including the last one, “Girls and Suitcases”.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Is that so? You must be the only one.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What happened to Mateo Blanco?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Because he vanished from public life…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It would seem that way.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Almost as if he’d died.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes . . . I lost track of him some time
ago.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ve always been intrigued by the case of his
last film.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Whose?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Mateo Blanco’s. The first five are stupendous.
You were the screenwriter for all of them, how do you explain that the
last one was a disaster?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Films turn out well or badly. The reason is
always a mystery. switched genres, perhaps he wasn’t skilled for . But
tell me about the story you want to write.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: … I would like to write a story about a son’s
revenge, one against the memory of his father.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why does the son desire revenge?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Because the father ruined his life, practically
nullifying him while he lived. The father is a successful financier,
violent, homophobic, very powerful and unscrupulous. He thinks everyone
has a price and that’s how he behaves with people. I don’t know if
you’ve had the misfortune of meeting someone like this…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: When you say he is powerful, what kind of
power are you referring to?</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: Economic, with everything that entails. He is
a broker, of the generation of speculators that made quick, high-profit
gains in the 80s; he amassed a great fortune during the oil crisis. The
son is sensitive, with complexes and artistic preoccupations, and lives
under his shadow, trying to please the father in everything. Despite
being a bit… homosexual, the son marries twice, just like the father,
and, just like him, he separates. He has a</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I get it. I am afraid I am not the writer you
are looking for.</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: You are, you don’t know how much!</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: I will pay whatever you ask.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s too personal.</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: Make it yours. I am not aiming for a biopic,
rather, I think of it as a base from which to develop a fiction.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Thanks, but no. And now, if you don’t
mind…</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: There you have my phone number, if you change
your mind.</p>
<p><strong>ray x</strong>: I am sure we will see each other again.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: In my case, that would be a miracle.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Did you overhear that?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Yes… I’m flipping out! Why did he ask you if
Mateo had died?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Look through the pictures of the `94 shoot.
Some of the photographs must have the date on it.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I think this is him…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: The man who just left.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It’s from the shoot. . He is carrying a small
camera, like a Super 8.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s a 16mm. Are you sure it’s him?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: He is now thinner and wears a beard, but it’s
him. He is talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What am I saying?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I don’t know. He is handing you something, it
looks like a pack of cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s a radio microphone. He is asking me to
wear it and I am refusing it.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ernesto Martel’s son.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You can put them away now…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: I can’t talk now, Rosanna.</p>
<p><strong>off</strong>: It’s about your son. I have caught him trying
on my dresses. And it’s not the first time…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: It’s your fault, you made him effeminate
to humiliate me!</p>
<p><strong>off</strong>: That’s not the problem, the boy is very
depressed, I’ve had to take him to a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: Don’t call him “boy”. He is already
seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>off</strong>: The doctor has told me he is in need of a
father figure… I think I am going to send him your way so that he can
spend some time with you, after all you are his father.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: If I haven’t been a good father in eighteen
years, I don’t think I can learn to be one precisely now.</p>
<p><strong>off</strong>: How can you speak like that! Have you no
feelings?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: I have them. Very deep feelings, they just
don’t include either of you.</p>
<p><strong>off</strong>: If anything happens to him, you’ll know who’s
at fault.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: Stop blackmailing me, Rosanna. Tell Ernesto
that if he wants to talk to me he should call me himself.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Don’t be so harsh with them, Ernesto!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: Blackmailers!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Why don’t you invite your son to spend a few
days here?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: It’d be better if you didn’t get involved
with them, Lena.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: He can keep me company… Does he like movies or
theater?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: I don’t know. But the mother has told me he
is a bit faggot. If I ask him to come I would like for you to tell me if
that’s true… and whether you think there’s any remedy…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: And how would I know?! What an idea!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: I am not asking you to fuck him, but you
good-looking girls can tell these things.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Call him, but you can’t count on me for the
rest.</p>
<p><strong>off ex-wife</strong>: I am not reproaching you for our
separation but that you live with a man… What will your children
think!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: That their father is a homosexual
and that he has very good taste. If they love me and you don’t set them
against me, they will accept it.</p>
<p><strong>off ex-wife</strong>: You should have told me before we
married!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: If you hadn’t been so exclusively
concerned with my father’s fortune you might have noticed it
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: I have to go, I have another
call.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: I hope not. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: It’s Judit Garcia.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: Oh, hello, Judit. Did you get the
money?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I don’t want it! I just sent it back,
Ernesto!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: You won’t call me Ray? It’s my
artistic name…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Artistic? What are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: Hoping to erase my father’s
name.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: And what does that have to do with Harry?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: I’ve been wanting to see him for a
long time. And it’s true that I want to shoot a movie and that I want
him to write the script. I’ve got the protagonist.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: You are not a director!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: You should take a look at my
documentary, you’d change your mind.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Ernesto, forget about us!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: Don’t be afraid of me. I am not my
father.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Do not come near Harry again. If you ever
stop by his house again I will report you for harassment.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I am not at all pleased with having to scout
outside Madrid, but the Americans pay a bundle and we need money.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You can leave without concerns. Don’t worry
about me.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I am also worried for Harry. Please, look
after him during my absence…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I have things to do, mom. I can’t look after
him all day.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: It’s only two weeks!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Harry manages perfectly on his own and right
now we are not writing anything.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I am worried about Ernesto Junior’s visit. I
would like for you to be on guard in case he appears or calls and then
let me know immediately!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Why are you so worried?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: He’s crazy. I don’t trust him.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Summarize it!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Diego, please, this is not the moment.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It never is for you!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Hey, if it bothers you so much to look after
Harry, I’ll quit the job and stay in Madrid! Or I’ll hire someone.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It doesn’t bother me to look after Harry! But
I am tired of so much secrecy!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Don’t go so fast!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I’m not. I’m just keeping you company. How
can you walk so fast?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I am training and I don’t work at night, nor
do I drug myself.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: What do you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That I take care of myself, with the
fanaticism of an older, handicapped person.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You are no fanatic.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes, I am. All of us who survive a critical
physical injury are. There is no other way.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: A billboard.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why so?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: In huge letters it says “Donate Blood”, it
includes where one has to go.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You want to donate blood?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: No, no… I was thinking that “Donate Blood” is
a good title for a movie…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes. It has a good ring.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: For a vampire flick.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Imagine that behind the billboard a whole
group of vampires that work in ambulatory care are hiding… and they
actually keep the blood they get from donors for their own consumption,
of course…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Your mother would like that story.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: The vampires would be like a type of ethnic
group, completely assimilated into Spanish society, they don’t stand
out. There are vampires who occupy important positions, keeping it a
secret . But even though they live in the shadows, they have amassed
great social and economic power…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They control various industries. For example,
the one responsible for dark sunglasses…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: And those that provide nightly entertainment:
bars, discos, after-hours… Since they don’t need drugs to stay awake,
they are the most apt for working at night. They don’t burn out…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: And those which sell best… This is all
great…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Protected by the sunscreen, they can function
all day… The lotion must be as dense as armour.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: This is how the story could begin: A gorgeous
woman, totally naked, rubbing her body with a super-dense lotion, before
heading to work at an ambulatory hospital. Her body is a velvety pale,
beautiful…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What a great opening! We also need a love
story…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: A hybrid love story, between the female
vampire and a normal guy.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Like in “Cat People”, a love story between
beings of different species…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: She works at one of those labs where blood is
donated and where they snatch it for themselves. The guy has gone to
donate his, or to get some tests. They like</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But they must like sex, right?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Of course. That’s one of the problems, the
couple desire each other desperately. But when it comes to fucking, she
becomes prudish…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Because she is afraid of losing control in
her excitement and taking a bite into his jugular…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Aha.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: When they’re horny, she lets him do
everything, front, back, whatever he wants, except ravaging her
mouth.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And her breasts?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Also… But that gets into high-risk territory.
When he sucks on her breasts, she has to cover her mouth with a pillow,
which she ends up shredding with her fangs…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And when she sucks his dick?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: And how does he react? A man may do without
kissing, but it’s very rough not to have your cock sucked.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Since he is deeply in love, he accepts the
situation . Once they are more comfortable with each other, she wears a
muzzle, as security for both. Because when she’s turned on, she has a
type of dental erection, her face grows into something like that of a
she-wolf…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I like your story very much, Diego.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Our story.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. This one was your idea, and you’ll author
it. I’ll be your sparring partner, for all the times you’ve done the
same for me…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Stop fondling me… damn it!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: It’s the GHB. It kicks your ass.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Do you want a little bit of “X”?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Just a tip. tip into the bag that Alex offers
him, he takes his Tomorrow I have to work, we are writing a vampire
script that’s going to be the shit!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Stop already, you are going to go through the
roof.</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Holy shit, he’s taken a drink from your glass!
Why in the world did you get Coca-cola! Didn’t you notice he was
drinking a jack and coke?</p>
<p><strong>friend a</strong>: I didn’t realize!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: He’s unconscious!</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No. I’m a friend. Diego just… he’s not well.
We are taking him into the emergency room…</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: No… because…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: What hospital are you taking him to?</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: …His uncle. I am on my way.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I am here to see Diego Garcia. He’s just been
admitted.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I am here to see Diego Garcia.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Are you immediate family?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes… I’m his uncle, and his godfather.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Your nephew is at the ICU, he arrived in a
coma…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: In a coma?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: But, what has happened?!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He ingested liquid ecstasy and alcohol… it
is a lethal combination. His friend informed us it was a mistake…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My God! But Diego is a very healthy boy…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Barring any complications, he will recover
in six to twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: If that’s the case, I’ll wait…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Go home, we will call you…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I’d rather wait.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Are you certain?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes. Guide me to a place where I can sit,
please…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Would you mind providing us with his
parents’ phone number?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: He only has a mother and, at the moment, she
is working outside Madrid… I would prefer to call her myself… I don’t
want to alarm her, unless he is truly in a grave condition…</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Normally, he should recuperate in a few
hours… but, in any case, you should have a talk with him, once he’s
better…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes, of course…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I don’t know… dazed. Did you speak with my
mother?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: And she believed it?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I don’t know. She wanted to hurry back, but I
convinced her to continue with the location scouting. At some point
you’ll have to call her.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Are you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I’m not sleepy anymore.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you want to talk?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Would you like me to speak?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I don’t know. If you’d like…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I say so in order to distract you. When I was
young, before I got into making movies, I was very good at telling
stories.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Well, then… would you mind telling me why my
mother is so afraid of Ernesto Junior?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She’s afraid of him?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Before she left, she made me promise that I
would remain alert, in case he reappeared…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She didn’t explain why?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: She never explains anything.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s a long story…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Judit says the same thing. How did you meet
him?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We met him… In an office we had rented in
preparation for my new film, about fourteen years ago.</p>
<p><strong>off harry</strong>: …After having written five dramas, I had
finally managed to write a script for a comedy, or that’s what I
thought. I wanted to change genres… to take a risk And I swear I
accomplished that, the part about taking a risk.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: What’s she like?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Too beautiful to be funny.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: She is Ernesto Martel’s lover, the tycoon.
She is here with his son.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: And she’s an actress?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Her? If she’s been with him for three years,
she must be. In any case, go out and say hello, to be polite. One must
get along well with important men. You never know.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I am sorry we showed up like this, but I’ve
heard you are running auditions… and I would like for you to give me a
try out.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I can come whatever day is convenient.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: You’re already here. Let’s read
something.</p>
<p><strong>off harry</strong>: The reading didn’t work out. We were both
too nervous. The first meeting and the reading we did only served to
make me realize that woman’s very presence perturbed me.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: Where have you been this
morning?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ernesto hasn’t told you?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: I haven’t asked him.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I went to see a film director.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: What for!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: For an audition.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: An audition? How so?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I want to work.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: Weren’t you going to study interior
design? Weren’t you going to redecorate the house? I thought we agreed
that you would transform what’s left of my two shipwrecked marriages
into something more our own…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Call a decorator… I want to be an actress.
I’ve always wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: You’ve already attempted it once… and
look how you’ve ended up.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: That’s a cheap shot.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: I am sorry, forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: In any case, don’t worry. It didn’t turn out
well. I was too nervous.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Come in!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: That’s the film director. He says the reading
was not sufficient and he wants to see me once more!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Go see him, no?!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Please, Ernesto. I need to do something! And
I’ve always wanted to be an actress!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: And what will become of me?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: They have not given me the role yet.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: They will…!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Well, if I were to get it, we would still see
each other every day, as it has been, in the mornings and evenings.
Nothing will change, except that during the day I would work, just like
you.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: Why don’t we get married?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: I am asking you to marry me…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Don’t you think you’ve married and divorced
enough times already?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: We’ve been living together for three years,
aren’t we fine like this?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: It doesn’t seem you are.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Ernesto Martel offered to produce the movie.
Your mother didn’t want him to. She was waiting for a subsidy from the
Ministry and an advance sale to television, but that would take months
and I was suddenly in a great hurry to begin shooting.</p>
<p><strong>off harry</strong>: I enjoyed making her up, styling her and
dressing her. Lena could be the Shirley McLaine of “The Apartment” and
the Audrey Hepburn of “Breakfast at Tiffany’s”, or even Goldie Hawn…</p>
<p><strong>off harry</strong>: Your mother didn’t like Lena.</p>
<p><strong>off harry</strong>: I, on the other hand, liked her a lot,
and she liked me.</p>
<p><strong>off harry</strong>: Ernesto Junior also liked me…</p>
<p><strong>off harry</strong>: I was hoping to use him for my own ends.
His father had asked him to make a documentary about the shooting…</p>
<p><strong>continued off harry</strong>: As far as Ernesto Senior was
concerned, I’ve never known a man more obsessed with a woman, except
myself. He was producing the film out of a desperate attempt to not lose
Lena. In the middle of this emotional quagmire, we began shooting… Your
mother was present at every instant, her face like a sergeant’s.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: Are you going to work on
something?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: No. You may go.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto j.</strong>: I don’t mind staying.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: It’s best if you leave. I am going to try out
some wigs.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: No! You don’t love them! You already have
many hours shot of wigs. This is more of the same.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto j.</strong>: And Lena?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: After she tries on the new wigs, she’s asked
for a massage therapist, she has a spasm…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto j.</strong>: Spasms… I don’t have footage of spasms…
Couldn’t I shoot that?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Ernesto, stop being a pest and leave already!
See you tomorrow!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I am going to speak to Magdalena… Do you mind
being on the lookout? Don’t let anyone interrupt us.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Is Junior around?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: No. I sent him home. There’s only Edurne, on
watch…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: This is madness, Mateo. I am no good for
you.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: You should have warned me sooner.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: I didn’t know one worked so hard in the
movies.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Well, yes, especially if you’re a girl.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Because you must put on makeup , dress up, do
your hair. Get dressed again, do your hair again. And that takes
hours.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: And you’re not tired?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: At the end of the week, sure, but I’m
happy…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: I was thinking we should take a break, a
weekend. Just the two of us, alone. At the house in Ibiza, or in Paris…
wherever you want… you and I.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I can’t travel until the shoot is over…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: I am talking about just a weekend.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: We rehearse on weekends.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: Don’t you also rehearse during the
shooting?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: What’s going on, you spend all day
rehearsing!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: That’s how one makes a movie! .</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: And everyone else’s life? It can’t be
set aside for months!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: The movie is boss.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: Excuse me, I’m the producer, so I’m the
boss.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: You look awful…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Little Diego… he could hardly breathe all
night… neither of us has slept a wink.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: You still don’t know what it is?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Take all the time you need… Even if we’re
shooting, your son is more important.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Thanks. One more thing, I’ve talked to the
producer.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: He complains that the shooting is
monopolizing Lena.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: And how does he think one makes movies?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Ernesto is a businessman, not an artist.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Then he shouldn’t have signed up as a
producer, no one asked him…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I warned you! Ernesto Martel doesn’t give a
crap about this movie and those of us making it, except for one person!
This weekend he is taking her to Ibiza with him, so you won’t be able to
rehearse.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: Have you put on makeup?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I want you to find me pretty.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: To me, you always are! It’s impossible
that you wouldn’t be pretty.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Would you like a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: No… thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Do you know how many fucks we’ve had since we
arrived yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: Six?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: With honours, yes?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yes, I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: We have to take advantage of our time.
We only have one more day left.</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: They are gifts from Mr. Ivan and I tossed them
out. He told me to keep them, but I don’t want them!</p>
<p><strong>chus</strong>: But you can’t do that, Ms. Pina. You could
have killed somebody… You can’t just throw things off the terrace, much
less if they are metal…</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: In Naples, on New Year’s Eve, they even throw
out furniture, my grandfather was Neapolitan… I carry it in my
blood.</p>
<p><strong>chus</strong>: But this is not Naples, nor is today New
Year’s Eve…</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: I was anxious and throwing things relaxes me…
Keep them if you like.</p>
<p><strong>chus</strong>: Thanks so much, Ms. Pina. But that’s not
right…</p>
<p><strong>chus</strong>: It’s not alright, Ms. Pina.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Your tone is off, Magdalena.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I’ll tell you later.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: We break for thirty minutes, it’s snack
time!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I’ve had a horrible weekend…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: But… we haven’t rehearsed, so that you could
rest!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Rest? I haven’t slept a wink all weekend… It’s
been a nightmare!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I have literally had Ernesto on top of me, all
those forty-eight hours, like a leech! He has not given me a second to
breathe, the asshole!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Well, you tell him that I am a grown-up now,
and free, and that I’ve forbidden you to follow me.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: You know I can’t tell him that.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Try it. It would do you good.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Do as you wish, but you’re not coming with
me.</p>
<p><strong>lower level</strong>: At the same time that the former is
taking place, Lena arrives to Martel’s mansion. She finds Ernesto Senior
with a drink in his hand, in one of the living areas , she approaches
him and gives him a slight kiss on the lips, in a gesture of hello.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: How are you?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Good, tired.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: And relaxed.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: The yoga is doing you good, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yes, especially after work…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: I am going to snack on something.
Will you join me?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I am not hungry, I’d rather go to bed right
now. I’ll only have a yogurt.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ernesto, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: Working.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Turn that off, you idiot! Hasn’t Mateo
forbidden you to tape us outside the shooting?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: My father has told me not to listen
to him… he wants to see everything.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You both have no scruples!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto junior</strong>: Remember I am taping you.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Listen carefully, Ernesto. Yes, I am talking
to you. I was just with the man I love and I am the happiest I’ve been
all my life because he loves me too! And listen carefully, Ernesto! I
will let</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I was just with the man I love and I am the
happiest that I’ve been all my life because he loves me too! And listen
carefully, Ernesto! I will let you be very soon! There is no need to spy
on me. I don’t have anything left to hide!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I am leaving, Ernesto. I am leaving you.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: You are not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: And how will you stop me?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: Lena, please.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: We have to get to the hospital. My
wife is badly hurt…</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: What’s happened?</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: I was in the living room and, since we
weren’t planning to go out, I started drinking early. I am pretty drunk,
as you may notice. Suddenly, I heard a thump, I ran to the stairs and
there she was. She tripped and fell down the stairs…</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Is this true, Madam?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yes… Can’t you leave the paperwork for
later?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Your husband can’t drive in this
condition!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Please!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Get out of there! I will drive!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: Absolutely not!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You either let me drive or we all stay
here until the ambulance arrives!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Stop it, Ernesto! Let him drive!</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Get down and sit in the back, with your
wife!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: If anything happens , you better be
ready… You have no idea who I am!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: No! And could we get going?!</p>
<p><strong>ernesto</strong>: You really can’t wait?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Hello, Mateo?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>off mateo</strong>: Has something happened?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Something unexpected has happened, but don’t
worry, everything’s OK.</p>
<p><strong>off mateo</strong>: Tomorrow the shooting begins in the
afternoon, will I see you before then?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I won’t be able to. I will see you directly at
the studio. I have something to do.</p>
<p><strong>off mateo</strong>: You’re acting strange, Magdalena. Are you
sure nothing’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yes. I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: What would you like me to do? What
can I do so that you will forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Take me to the studio.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: You shouldn’t move.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: If you don’t take me, I’ll go there myself,
even if I have to drag myself.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: And what will you say? how will you
explain the cast on your leg and the bruises?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: To me? I will do whatever you ask,
as long as you promise you’ll stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I will stay, under the condition that you let
Mateo finish the shooting, according to what he decides.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: He will barrage you with questions,
that guy’s not stupid.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I will tell him I tripped.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto senior</strong>: And how will you shoot, if you can’t
walk?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I don’t know. Whatever Mateo decides, but I
want to rest assured that you will respect his decision, no matter the
cost nor the time that it will take. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: … And that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ernesto is prepared to support whatever you
decide.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Decide, what?! I can’t move from one shot
where you are walking normally to another one where you are wearing a
cast! How long must you wear the cast?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Can we stop for those three weeks? With pay
for the team, of course.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto s.</strong>: If there is no other option!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I hate stopping! Movies, when you pick them
back up, are no longer the same!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Do you mind if I speak to Lena alone for a
moment?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Be careful, he may walk in.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Let him walk in!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Tell me the truth! People don’t fall down the
stairs, that only happens in movies.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Mateo, we must finish the shooting as soon as
possible! Until then, I cannot leave Ernesto.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Why not? He’s a psychopath! What more proof
do you need?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I cannot leave, I’ve made a deal with him.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: A deal? What deal?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: But I cannot ask you for such a
sacrifice.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You have not asked me…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I can’t accept it either.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Mateo, please!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: There must be another answer.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: What else? The only solution is that I
continue to live with him until you finish the film.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Can you take it?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You don’t have to think about that… What’s
important is that you finish shooting.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Exactly what have you agreed to?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I’ve told you, to live under the same roof,
with him in his room and me in mine. He doesn’t have the right to
anything more.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: And you think he will be content with
that?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: We would have to repeat part of the stairway
scene…</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: Leave that note there! It’s not for you. How
dare you take it and crumple it?</p>
<p><strong>julieta</strong>: What do you have to speak to Ivan about,
you whore!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: It’s none of your business.</p>
<p><strong>julieta</strong>: I am his wife.</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: His wife has been admitted at a psychiatric
hospital for twenty years now.</p>
<p><strong>julieta</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>julieta</strong>: I am no longer committed. I am now here
with you. Walking down the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>julieta</strong>: You are in a hurry to see him, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>julieta</strong>: Well, what are you waiting for!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: What a drag! Oh, it’s you?</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: I’ve left you a thousand messages!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: And this suitcase?!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: It’s Ivan’s. He’s leaving me.</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: And that broken leg?</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down
the stairs . . .</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: I see, we’re in great shape…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Cut!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I am sorry…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Don’t worry, it will turn out. But I don’t
know what more direction to give you.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You have told me everything, in every way
possible…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Ernesto is getting just what he hoped. That
we make a piece of crap of a movie! I told you not to agree to that
deal…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: We can’t let him have his way! Every day I
arrive worn out and every day I recover, right?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I ask you only for a bit more patience… And a
kiss!</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: Listen, if that’s how you’ll greet me, I’ll
leave.</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: No, c’mon! Come inside!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: She’s so much better! Grab this one!</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Let’s look at fourteen, it’s even better!</p>
<p><strong>off harry</strong>: When we finished shooting, I quickly
selected all the takes for the film so that I could rescue Lena as soon
as possible from the Martel house. The situation had</p>
<p><strong>off</strong>: It’s Magdalena.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Is there something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>off</strong>: No. I’m downstairs. I’ve forgotten my money. I
have to pay the cab . . .</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I’ll be right down.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: But . . . what has happened?!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: We have had a brutal fight… At the end, he
ripped my clothes off and my shoes and he threw me out naked onto the
highway. The jacket belongs to the cab driver. You must give him a good
tip, if it weren’t for him I don’t know how I would have made it
here…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Take us to the nearest police station…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: No, please…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: We must denounce him, Magdalena!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: He will turn against you!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: No, not your house.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: We have to look after you. Let’s go to a
hotel…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Let’s leave Madrid.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Look. It’s us.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Do you want to go back home and return to the
“Donate Blood” story?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I am hoping to get back to it, but first tell
me what happened in Lanzarote. You can’t leave me hanging!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Without realizing, a month had elapsed… I
knew that sooner or later we would have to return, but we kept
postponing it. I was only worried about you and your mother. I had not
even said goodbye and you were still suffering from your allergy problem
when we left… I can imagine Judit was furious with me.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You can’t imagine how much.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was planning to return soon to finish the
editing… and to explain things to your mother. But Magdalena decided
she’d wait for me on the island. She couldn’t stand the thought of
seeing Ernesto again.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Sorry to interrupt… I wanted to ask if there
are any employment opportunities available here, with you… You always
look so busy… I have a lot of free time…</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: We could use the help, especially now that
the high season is about to start… Do you have experience?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I have worked as a secretary at M. Capital, a
very important finance company.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: You could first work during the afternoons
and, then, we could see…</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: We were just saying that the girl in the
ad looks like you.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: No. It’s not me.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I was wondering how long it would take him to
emerge!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: But they can’t release the film so soon,
right?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: No. It’s a scheme to annoy us, and a trap to
get you to return. The ad is only lacking the words “Missing.”</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Nothing. Fuck them!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: That the only intelligent thing we have done
has been not to attend the premier, that my acting is pathetic, that you
seem like a first-time director and that you lack talent. At the end, it
wonders who might have made your first films. Never before has such a
resounding downfall been witnessed… How horrible!</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Judit. It’s me. I hope you and the boy are
OK. I apologize that I left without notice, but terrible things have
happened, I will explain. Speaking of which, I need to talk to you,
urgently. Please call me! Here’s the number… Oh, and, ask for Harry
Caine, I have registered under that name… I will be waiting for your
call!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Luis, I just read in the newspaper that the
film has opened and I am beside myself!! I don’t know what the fuck is
going on there, but I would like to know! OK, I’ll ring back!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: And mom, did she call you back?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: She was pissed, I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I remember that time, it was while I was
undergoing treatment for pulmonary aspergillosis. It was a horrible time
for me… Not just because of the illness, my mother was like a crazy
woman… I had just seen “The Exorcist” and, for some time, I believed she
was possessed…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I was the demon, Diego. And I am sorry. I
suppose I behaved selfishly, but I am not sure I had a choice…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The fact is she never did, and we’ve never
spoken of it. Neither one of us has broached the topic.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: And you weren’t curious?…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Me? Curiosity was killing me! For two days I
called both your mother and Luis non-stop, the editor , but neither of
them answered! So I decided to return to Madrid the next day so that I
could witness what was happening for myself!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: How did you meet Ernesto Senior?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: And… how did you end up with him? You fell in
love?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: He was very generous with me and my family. My
father was dying, I needed to take him to a private Hospital and Ernesto
took care of everything… He paid for everything… And he made sure that
my parents could return to their home town and that they lacked
nothing…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Pardon me, I have no right to ask you about
that time in your life.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: It’s only natural that you would want to know.
And I don’t want any skeletons between us. I would like to be able to
forget all that, but you have the right to ask.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: No. I do not have any right. For me, you were
born the day you came for the audition. You looked at me, I saw your
face and… I was left hypnotized.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I remember your face perfectly. I think I fell
in love with the way you looked at me. I thought: this man will be my
salvation.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: It’s the first time we part…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Either way, I will return next weekend. But
if you are going to be worried, you should come with me.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: No… I will be better off here.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: And did I manage to save you from
anything?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Mateo, say something!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Mateo is dead, Judit.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Don’t say that!</p>
<p><strong>psychiatrist</strong>: We call him by his name, but he
doesn’t respond to it. He insists Mateo has died.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Images are the source of his work… and to
live in the dark, I suppose that’s death to him… Is there any chance he
will see?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: None. His is what we refer to as a cortical
blindness, and it’s irreversible. It’s the result of a lesion to the
occipital lobe, the intelligent part of the brain, which has the role of
processing all visual information. In other words, the neurons have
died… and that’s permanent…</p>
<p><strong>off harry</strong>: I felt as though I had died with Lena.
The Mateo- film-director who had left Madrid would never return.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Did you visit Lena’s mother at her
hometown?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: She was very thankful to Ernesto for having
taken care of everything…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes, they buried her next to her father.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Did you visit the grave?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>dieguito</strong>: I also want to go to the beach!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Do whatever you need to do. We’ll wait for
you there.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Bundle up! And don’t get too close to the
water. Don’t let go of his hand!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I am here to pay Mateo Blanco’s bill.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: We don’t have anyone here registered by
that name.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: It’s the man who had the accident. He was in
bungalow number two.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: Oh, you mean Harry Caine.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: Poor souls! They are not the first to have
an accident on that traffic circle! Awful!</p>
<p><strong>dieguito</strong>: Look… There are kites!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Harry! Harry Caine!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: We’re here, Judit!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: We have to go, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Let’s go, Dieguito. Give me your hand.</p>
<p><strong>dieguito</strong>: Can’t we stay a little longer?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. We must obey your mother… You’ve had
enough wind for one day…</p>
<p><strong>dieguito</strong>: But I’m already all better!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Play “Elevator to the Gallows” and take a
look at the ending…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Do you always watch the same movies?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes. Since I know them by heart, I can
visualize the action.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Is there any new movie you’d want to
see…?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes. But you’d have to describe the action.
Your mother used to describe some to me, some time ago.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I wouldn’t mind doing so.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I would like to “watch” one by Tarantino or
Scorsese, and also some Asian cinema…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Done.</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: What a drag! Oh, it’s you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: That’s “Girls and Suitcases”!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Turn up the volume!</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: I’ve left you a thousand messages.</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: Yes. A thousand from you, and none from
Ivan.</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: And this suitcase?</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: It’s Ivan’s. He’s leaving me.</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: And the cast on your leg?</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down
the stairs and I broke my leg…</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: Wow! Well, we’re in good shape… I also broke
up with my husband…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: They’re terrible!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: How could I have thought these takes were the
good ones! What was I thinking!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Yes, come in!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Luis, the editor, sent it to me six years
ago. At that time I didn’t even bother to open it, I didn’t want to know
anything about him. I am now thinking</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: At the end he says this is my new number, a
number’s written down.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Call him, please!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Right now? It’s too early.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: May I get dressed? I’m naked…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Could I speak to Luis, please?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Luis died six years ago!</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Oh, I am so sorry… I had no idea!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It was cancer. I’m his widow. Who are
you?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Mateo Blanco. Luis edited all my films…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Mateo Blanco! Luis spoke to me about you. I
am his second wife…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: The one I know is Nieves, the first one.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We married twelve years ago.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I am sorry to hear about Luis’ death. I would
have liked to speak to him…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: He would have liked so too! Once he was quite
ill and didn’t want to speak to anyone, he would always tell me that, if
it was you, I should hand him the phone…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: You have no idea how sorry I am!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: My editor. I just found out he died six years
ago…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Not long before he died he sent me this
notebook. But I didn’t want to know anything about him, I also didn’t
know he was dying… and I put it away… until today… His wife just told me
he would have liked to speak to me, that was the purpose of sending me
the notebook… but I didn’t give him the chance.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Had you spoken since the accident?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No. Never.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: The coffee is in front of you…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Are you OK? Would you like me to stay
here?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: No, no… You’re heading out?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: My mother arrives today. I would like to be
home when she arrives.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: I didn’t know she was arriving…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I didn’t either, she left me a message this
morning. She’s coming to celebrate your birthday, with us…</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: It’s my birthday?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It seems so. Today’s the , does that sound
right?</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Yes. A day like today, fifty-one years ago, I
entered the world.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I was dying to see you! Are you OK, my
son?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I was very worried about you!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Mateo has looked after me day and night…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Mateo? You’re not calling him Harry…?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Nothing… Watching movies… and talking…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Talking?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Mom, please!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: OK. So what happened to you? I don’t know if
I should believe the thing about the stomach flu, you two used that as
an excuse in a script…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: … an accident. But I would rather not speak
of that right now…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: What kind of accident?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It’s hard to explain.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Try to! I am not that stupid!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: What’s wrong with you, Diego?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Nothing. I’m doing just fine. I’m going to
buy a present for Mateo.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: For Mateo…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Alright, Harry.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Call him however you wish. That’s the
advantage of having two names.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Wait, my arms are full…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Are those flowers?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes! Happy Birthday!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Thank you for looking after Diego… I don’t
know how to thank you!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: You’ve been looking after me for fourteen
years now…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I don’t know. It should be your son to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: What is wrong with the two of you? Why is it
that he suddenly is not calling you Harry but Mateo?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Two weeks ago, at the place where he D.J.’s,
by mistake, he grabbed a friend’s drink that had been spiked with
G.H.B., liquid ecstasy. He thought it was his drink, both drinks had
Coca-cola.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Liquid ecstasy?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Yes. It’s a very dangerous drug when it’s
mixed with alcohol and Diego had already had two Cuba Libres before he
drank from his friend’s glass…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: And… what happened… exactly?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: He was badly affected. He spent two days in
urgent care, after that, I brought him here.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Diego’s a drug addict?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: No. I’ve told you, he drank from the glass
containing liquid ecstasy by mistake…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: But how can one make a mistake with something
like that?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: At first glace one cannot tell the
difference. Both glasses contained Coca-cola… It’s not the first time it
happens…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Diego has not told you so that you wouldn’t
be alarmed…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Well, he hasn’t succeeded. At some point he
will have to speak to me, no?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: He is wanting to do so!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Is that so? Because I ask him and he doesn’t
answer!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Then you should try answering him, when he
asks you.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: The two of you are acting very differently.
Both of you. You both have changed.</p>
<p><strong>at the bar before one enters the restaurant.</strong>: Judit
and Mateo are having something to drink. Mateo tilts his head subtly in
front of Judit.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: You smell good…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I have put on some makeup and I am dressed as
a woman.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: What’s the dress like?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I haven’t changed much, Harry. I am wearing
my hair short.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Short like Jean Seberg in “Breathless”? Like
Joan of Arc on the bonfire? Like Liza Minnelli in “Cabaret”? Or like Yul
Brynner?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Short, or rather, very short, like that of
all fortysomethings who want to appear younger.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I am sure it looks good on you. Thanks for
dressing up for me, Judit…</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: My name is Javier. How many are you?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Please, grab onto each other’s shoulders and
follow me in Indian-file. I will guide you to your table. It’s number
eight.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: What is the idea here, Harry?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: We are dinning in darkness.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: You didn’t know this, ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: You should have been warned, but don’t
worry. People get used to it after a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Imagine that your plate is the face of a
watch. Your silverware is at 9h and at 3h. Your glass at 1h. Bread at
11h.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Harry, what is all this about?</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: We want our clients to discover that the
lack of sight harnesses the other senses. Touch, taste, smell and sound
will acquire a special intensity tonight, ma’am. I hope you’ll enjoy
them.</p>
<p><strong>javier</strong>: Will the gentlemen be drinking
something?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Bring us a bottle of wine, to toast.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I found out about this place in the newspaper
and I wanted to check it out.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It’s a German idea, there are various
restaurant like this one, they’re totally in fashion.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Darkness, in fashion? I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Let’s toast!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes. Let’s toast.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Happy Birthday!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Happy Birthday! We must look into each
other’s eyes.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Well, we’re kind of screwed…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Oh, sorry… It slipped.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Joy! Joy! Bring your ear to me so that I can
sprinkle some wine behind it. It’s for good luck!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I don’t know what you’ve been talking about
these past days…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: But I do know what I haven’t talked to you
about all these years…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I’ve never asked you…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: But you must have asked yourself a thousand
times. This is my birthday gift, Mateo. The gift is also for you,
Diego.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: After you disappeared, Ernesto Senior thought
only of his revenge. A plan had occurred to him but, to carry it out, he
had to bribe, at the very least, both Luis and me. It wasn’t an issue,
we both sold ourselves without hesitation. Luis and I. With me, he had
the courtesy to provide an alibi, he proposed that I leave for a month
and a half to the United States, to the Mayo Clinic, so that Diego could
undergo a cure for his aspergillosis, that way I wouldn’t have to be
present while he destroyed the movie . I opted to stay in Madrid and
have Diego undergo his cure here. I wanted to witness everything. If I
was going to betray you, I wanted to pay the full price…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: What a living hell! For both of you!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You said it!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes. It was torture to watch Ernesto select
the worst takes of each shot and Luis edit them together, turning your
film into a monster . The only way of withstanding that was to suffer
more.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Don’t continue, Judit! It’s not
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes. Now that you once again call yourself
Mateo, I have no excuse.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: That’s why I never called you, but even if
you don’t believe it, I was very worried for you and the boy.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I believe you…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Ernesto hired various detectives to search
for you, but before they found you, you called me, two days after the
premier. I was too embarrassed to answer, and… too stunned. I still am.
When Ernesto Senior asked me again about you, I don’t know why, I gave
him the phone number for Famara…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: He was the one who found you after the
accident and called the hospital…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Did he have something to do with the
accident?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: No! But I can’t stop thinking that had I not
given his father the phone number, perhaps nothing would have
happened…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Why do you think that?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: If you don’t know, then stop torturing
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Good night. Call me if you need anything…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You are sweating…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: It’s a panic attack… Hand me the purse!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I will sleep well with this…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Do you want me to stay here?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Here? What for?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: In case the panic returns, so that you don’t
feel alone.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Thank you. I am feeling better… and I’ll fall
asleep soon.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Call me, if you are not feeling well…</p>
<p><strong>waiter friend</strong>: Why here so early?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I couldn’t sleep. Would you mind dialing this
number?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: How impressive!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I am specializing in breakfasts. I would do
the same for Mateo…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Are you OK?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes, don’t worry about last night. It’s
horrible, but it only happens occasionally and I know how to stop
it…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It scared me, it seemed as though an alien
would pop out of your stomach.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: About Mateo?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: You can tell me some other time. Now it’s
time for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: If I don’t tell you now, I may never do so…
At the end of the eighties, in `77, to be exact.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: The year of punk.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes, in the year of punk, Mateo and I became
involved…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: In a love affair?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes… We were just getting started in film,
and we are still at it, but our love affair ended, at least on his side…
That didn’t keep us from working together… until now…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I knew all that, or I imagined it…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: There’s one more thing… Mateo is your
father…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: And that fleeting lover, my supposed
biological father? You made him up?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: No… I… can hide things… but I never make
things up… I don’t know how to make up… The fleeting lover existed, he
was gay and our affair was short-lived. His name was Vicente and it was
while I was with him that you were conceived, but your biological father
was Mateo, not Vicente.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Does Mateo know?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: No. At that time, he asked me and I denied
it, of course. I didn’t want to put pressure on him, I didn’t want our
relationship to change because of it. After all, I had never asked him
if he wanted to become a father.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I see…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: I will not recriminate you… I think I like
being Mateo’s son … Speaking of, he called early this morning…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Mateo. At 8h.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: For you to call him as soon as you could.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: That I call him? Why in the world have you
not awakened me?!</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Because, after what happened last night, you
needed to sleep. He didn’t say it was urgent. You can call him now.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Diego has told me to call you. Are you OK? Do
you need anything?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I am not alright, Judit. And yes, I do need
something… The forty thousand meters of negative we shot during my last
film in order to edit it… I am at the home of Ernesto Junior and I just
found out the material was destroyed in ’94. I imagined something like
this, I just didn’t think it would have happened that soon…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Let me explain…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: No. I am in a hideous mood, Judit, and I
don’t want to take it out on you!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: What are you doing at Ernesto’s house?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I think I am going to bribe him. We need
money, I don’t want Diego back at that damn bar. I want to pay Diego a
salary, we need money and he has money to throw…</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Mateo, stop talking crazy!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: It is not craziness. I can’t think of anyone
else to blame for Magdalena’s death.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: My God! Wait a second… I have something to
tell you.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Let it be, you already said enough last
night.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Since you insist, I will ask you. What do you
have to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: In effect, Ernesto Senior asked for it to be
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: In ’94! Very shortly after the release of
that aberration.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Yes. In any case, sooner or later the lab
disposes of all the material… and that was many years ago.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: That’s not anything that I don’t already
know.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: As the film’s producer I was the only one who
had access to the lab… to all the material. After I gave the order to
have everything destroyed, I intercepted it. And I kept it. I have all
of it at home.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: You are lying to me.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: I didn’t tell you this last night because I
didn’t realize you wanted to edit it. I took everything, all the double
takes, the internegative, the sound tapes… Everything! You can have it
whenever you want!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: That changes everything.</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: Please, get out of that place, leave Ernesto
alone. He had nothing to do with this.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: I am not so sure. He has yet to explain what
he was doing in Lanzarote. I’ll let you go, it seems he wants to
talk…</p>
<p><strong>ernesto j.</strong>: Here is a copy of “the making of”.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: And why would I want that? I can’t watch it!
Plus, I’m not interested.</p>
<p><strong>ernesto j.</strong>: Have someone you trust watch it and tell
you about it. Oh, and even if my father had asked me to</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Is there something new I should know
about?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It’s a very interesting documentary… And,
yes, in effect, Ernesto followed you to Lanzarote, until the last
moment.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: The images are there?</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: Those of the last night?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Yes. He recorded you at a safe distance,
while you were on you way back after dinner. The scene is lit by the
light of his headlights. It’s not a lot, but enough to see what
happened. Not only did he not have anything to do with the accident, he
saved your life.</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: And one more e thing: When you were at the
traffic circle, before the SUV crashed into to you, you and Lena
kiss…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: A kiss? I don’t remember it…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: It was an ordinary kiss, just one more of the
many kisses a couple gives each other, almost without thinking…</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: The last kiss…</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: What a drag! Oh, it’s you?</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: I have left you a thousand messages!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: Yes. A thousand from you and none from
Ivan.</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: What about this suitcase!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: It’s Ivan’s. He’s leaving me.</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: And that cast on your leg?</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: His ex-wife, the crazy one. She pushed me down
the stairs…</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: Well, we’re in good shape! I’ve also broken up
with my husband…</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: Oh, sorry to hear it! I will make some coffee,
I have spent my entire night looking for Ivan and I haven’t gone to
bed.</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: Neither have I.</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: When did you leave him?</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: Four days ago. I could see it coming. The
thing is that after breaking up, I go out onto the street and I notice
there is this “guy” looking at me.</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: Oh my, gazpacho! Can I have a bowl?</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: In case Ivan arrived, he loves gazpacho.</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: Pina, my God!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: And that’s not all! Since he wasn’t calling,
I’ve torn the phone from the wall, in a moment of rage…</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: I’ve tripped on the thing, but I didn’t want
to pry… And the bed? I think I noticed it smoking a bit…</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: I dropped a lit match and it began to burn,
and I didn’t want to squelch it. Fire purifies. I will have to change
the mattress, but all for the best! A whole lot of less memories!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: But excuse me, I’ve interrupted you. You were
telling me…</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: Yes. I was telling you that I also have a
suitcase at home.</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: Your husband’s?</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: No. It’s a suitcase with fifteen kilos of
cocaine, uncut.</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: You’ve become a dealer, Chon?</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: No! How could you think that! I am still a
Counselor for Social Affairs in the City Hall! The suitcase appeared in
my closet. Imagine the scandal if the police find out. They could put me
in jail!</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: I have to get rid of those fifteen kilos as
soon as possible. Because of the hours we keep, politicians consume a
lot of drugs. So, between my party cohorts and city hall, I could
distribute two kilos, but what do I do with the rest!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: Throw it out!</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: Are you crazy? How could I throw it out?! I
have to keep the police from finding it in my house… I have to take it
some other place, immediately!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: But I don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: Well, it’s clear, honey!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: How is it that the suitcase appeared in your
closet?</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: As I was telling you, after breaking up with
my husband, I bumped into this guy on the street who kept watching at
me, good-looking, well hung. Summing up, I took him home and screwed him
over and over…</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: An how was he?</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: In bed? Divine. Look at my arm hair? I’ve got
goose-bumps!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: So you lost your mind…</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: What else could I do?! So he asked me if he
could stay at my place for a few days and I said OK, but I couldn’t
promise anything. I didn’t want him thinking that I was that easy. So he
brought the suitcase. He asked me if I cared if he kept it in the
closet. He said that he was attached to the suitcase. And, well, why
would I care?! By pure chance, I am watching TV last night and I find
out that the police have nabbed him in the course of a drug sting
operation and that he is one of the most wanted traffickers! I open the
suitcase and I discover that it is filled with little bags of cocaine. I
ran out of the house and I haven’t returned since…</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: What a story, my God!</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: I was wondering why he was such a good fuck!
For men living in such high-stakes conditions, each fuck could be the
last! Look, the goose-bumps!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: I’ve seen them already… They comes easy for
you… And the suitcase?</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: I was going to ask you… if you didn’t mind
that I brought it here. If they find it in my house, well, it’s not
about what could happen to me, but that it’s just not an ideal situation
for the Counselor of Social Affairs. Imagine how upset the mayor would
be, and my party! My party can’t take one more scandal!</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: The police!</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: Shush, how could it be the police?! No one
knows you’re here!</p>
<p><strong>chon</strong>: I am a woman who attracts attention, Pina.
Since I was a little girl…</p>
<p><strong>pina</strong>: Just pretend you’re here for coffee…</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: This is hilarious!</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: It doesn’t sound like what we watched on TV,
right?</p>
<p><strong>diego</strong>: Not at all! This is a whole different
thing!</p>
<p><strong>judit</strong>: It’s wonderful, Mateo. We should re-release
it.</p>
<p><strong>mateo</strong>: The important thing is to finish it. Films
must be finished.</p>
