<h1 id="how-to-train-your-dragon">how-to-train-your-dragon</h1>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: This, is Berk. It’s twelve days North of
hopeless, and a few degrees South of freezing to death. It’s located
solidly on the meridian of misery. The camera drifts over rolling hills
to reveal a small village nestled on an outcropping of sea mounts.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: My village. In a word, sturdy. And it’s been
here for seven generations, but every single building is new. The camera
drifts closer, circling.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: We have fishing, hunting, and a charming
view of the sunsets. The only problems are the pests. You see, most
places have mice or mosquitos. We have… Sheep graze peacefully on a
hillside. Suddenly one is snatched.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: …dragons.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Most people would leave. Not us. We’re
Vikings. We have stubbornness issues. Vikings sound the alarm. Viking
men and women pour out into the streets, axes in hand. ON HICCUP darting
through alleys, staying under eaves, making his way through the
battle.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: My name’s Hiccup. Great name, I know. But
it’s not the worst. Parents believe a hideous name will frighten off
gnomes and trolls. Like our charming Viking demeanor wouldn’t do that.
Dragons sweep back and forth, dodging axes and blasting the Vikings who
throw them. A burly warrior gets tossed in an explosion, knocking Hiccup
to the ground.</p>
<p>****: Arggghhhhh! Mornin’! Hiccup gets to his feet and continues to
rush past gigantic men and women.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Meet the neighbors. Hoark the Haggard…</p>
<p><strong>hoark</strong>: What are you doing out!?</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: … Burnthair the Broad…</p>
<p><strong>burnthair</strong>: Get inside!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: … Phlegma the Fierce…</p>
<p><strong>phlegma the fierce</strong>: Get back inside!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: . Ack. He passes a silent ox of a viking,
picking his ear.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yep, just Ack. Enter STOICK, the biggest
Viking of all. He yanks Hiccup from the path of a strafing dragon and
holds aloft to the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Hiccup!? What is he doing out again?!</p>
<p>****: What are you doing out?! Get inside! The flames light up his
scowling face and matted red beard. He sets Hiccup down and turns to the
sky, searching.</p>
<p>****: That’s Stoick the Vast. Chief of the tribe. They say that when
he was a baby he popped a dragon’s head clean off of its shoulders. Do I
believe it? Stoick grabs a wooden cart and hurls it, knocking the
strafing dragon out of the sky.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yes I do. An EXPLOSION forces Vikings to
DUCK. Stoick stands firm, brushing flaming debris off of his
shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: What have we got?</p>
<p><strong>viking #1</strong>: Gronkles. Nadders. Zipplebacks. Oh, and
Hoark saw a Monstrous Nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Any Night Furies?</p>
<p><strong>viking #1</strong>: None so far.</p>
<p>****: Good.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Hoist the torches! Massive flaming braziers
are raised on poles, lighting up the night sky… and revealing swirling
dragons of all types. Below, Hiccup crosses an open plaza and ducks into
an open building with a tall chimney.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Ah! Nice of you to join the party. I thought
you’d been carried off. Hiccup dons a leather apron and starts to put
away Gobber’s scattered appendages.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Who me? Nah, come on! I’m way too muscular
for their taste. They wouldn’t know what to do with all this. Hiccup
strikes a bodybuilder pose.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: They need toothpicks, don’t they? Hiccup
gets to work, transferring bent and chipped weapons to the forge as
Vikings crowd the counter for replacements.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: The meathead with attitude and
interchangeable hands is Gobber. I’ve been his apprentice ever since I
was little. Well…littler.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: We move to the lower defenses. We’ll
counter-attack with the catapults.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: See? Old village. Lots and lots of new
houses.</p>
<p><strong>fire!</strong>: In response, the fire brigade charges through
the plaza – four TEENS, tugging a large wooden cask on wheels. From it,
they fill buckets of water to douse the flames. One among them is a
cute, energetic Viking girl. Hiccup leans out of the stall to watch
her.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh and that’s Fishlegs, Snotlout. The twins
Ruffnut and Tuffnut. And…</p>
<p>****: Astrid. A SLOW-MOTION explosion erupts behind her, framing her
in a sexy ball of fire. The others join her, looking awesome and
heroic.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Their job is so much cooler. Hiccup tries to
join them as they pass, but he’s hooked by Gobber and hoisted back
inside.</p>
<p>****: Ah, come on. Let me out, please. I need to make my mark.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Oh, you’ve made plenty of marks. All in the
wrong places.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Please, two minutes. I’ll kill a dragon. My
life will get infinitely better. I might even get a date.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: You can’t lift a hammer. You can’t swing an
axe… Gobber grabs a bola .</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: … you can’t even throw one of these. A
Viking runs by and nabs it out of Gobber’s hand, hurling it at a
dive-bombing Gronkle. The bola binds its legs, sending it into a heavy
crash.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay fine, but… He rushes to the back corner
of the stall and presents a bizarre, wheel barrow-like contraption.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: … this will throw it for me. Hiccup OPENS
the hinged lid of the device. An arm springs up, equipped with twin
bows. They prematurely launch a bola, narrowly missing Gobber… and
taking out a Viking at the counter.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Arggh!</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: See, now this right here is what I’m talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Mild calibration issue.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Hiccup. If you ever want to get out there to
fight dragons, you need to stop all… Gobber gestures in Hiccup’s general
direction.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: … this.</p>
<p>****: But… you just pointed to all of me.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Yes! That’s it! Stop being all of you.</p>
<p>****: Ohhhh…</p>
<p>****: Ohhhhh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: You, sir, are playing a dangerous game.
Keeping this much, raw…Vikingness contained.</p>
<p>****: There will be consequences! Gobber tosses him a sword.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: I’ll take my chances. Sword. Sharpen. Now.
Hiccup takes it begrudgingly and lobs it onto the grinding wheel. He
stews… fantasizing…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: One day I’ll get out there. Because killing
a dragon is everything around here.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: A Nadder head is sure to get me at least
noticed. The Nadders clamber onto the building, tearing the roof and
walls apart. Sheep pour out and SCATTER. Elsewhere, hippo-like Gronckles
pick drying racks clean of fish and fly off like loaded pelicans.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Gronckles are tough. Taking down one of
those would definitely get me a girlfriend. A stealthy, snake-like
dragon head peeks over a rooftop, breathing gas into a chimney.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: A Zippelback? Exotic, exciting. Two heads,
twice the status. A second head pokes through the door and lights it.
KABLAM! The two heads fly through the explosion, their necks zipping
together to reveal a single body. It flies past Stoick as he climbs to
the top of a CATAPULT</p>
<p><strong>catapult operator</strong>: They found the sheep!</p>
<p>****: Concentrate fire over the lower bank!</p>
<p><strong>catapult operator</strong>: Fire! Boulders are catapulted at
the corralling Nadders… Just as a huge red dragon whips past, spraying
the base of the catapult with sticky fire.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: And then there’s the Monstrous Nightmare.
Only the best Vikings go after those. They have this nasty habit of
setting themselves on fire. It emerges from the flames, climbing the
catapult with a leering, toothy grin.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Reload! I’ll take care of this. Stoick takes
on the Nightmare, face to hammer. Suddenly, a LOUD BALLISTIC MOANING
streaks overhead. The catapult crew ducks.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: But the ultimate prize is the dragon no one
has ever seen. We call it the–</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Night Fury! Get down! Vikings everywhere
take shelter. The moaning sound BUILDS.</p>
<p><strong>jump!</strong>: KABOOM! The Catapult EXPLODES as though hit
by an artillery shell… sending Stoick and the crew leaping for their
lives.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: This thing never steals food, never shows
itself, and… The sound recedes, leaving the crippled catapult in
flames.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: …never misses.</p>
<p>****: No one has ever killed a Night Fury. That’s why I’m going to be
the first.</p>
<p><strong>in the stall</strong>: Gobber trades his hammer for an
axe.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Man the fort, Hiccup, they need me out
there! Gobber pauses. Turns with a threatening glare.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Stay. Put. There. You know what I mean.
Gobber charges into the fray, HOLLERING. ON HICCUP, a smirk crosses his
face.</p>
<p><strong>viking #6</strong>: Hiccup, where are you going!</p>
<p><strong>viking #7</strong>: Come back here!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I know. Be right back!</p>
<p><strong>on the plain below</strong>: The Nadders have cornered the
house-full of sheep. They close in, ready to spring upon them. Stoick
suddenly appears, HURLING FISHING NETS over them. The surprised Nadders
are caught. Stoick and his men rush in. A Nadder blasts a hole through
its net. Stoick leaps onto it, clamping his thick arms around its head,
forcing its jaws shut.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Mind yourselves! The devils still have some
juice in them.</p>
<p><strong>on the plain above</strong>: Hiccup reaches a cliff
overlooking the smoking CATAPULT and drops the handles to the ground. He
cranks several levers, unfolding and then cocking the bowed arms of his
contraption. He drops a bola onto a chamber and then pivots the weapon
on a gimbal head toward the dark sky. He listens, with his eye pressed
to the scope, hand poised on the trigger. He hears the NIGHT FURY
approaching… and turns his aim to the defense tower. It closes in for
the final strike, completely camouflaged in the night.</p>
<p>****: Come on. Give me something to shoot at, give me something to
shoot at. KABLAM! The tower topples. The blast of fire illuminates the
dragon for a split second. Hiccup pulls the trigger. KERTHUNK! The
flexed arms SNAP forward, springing the weapon off the ground. The bola
disappears into the sky, followed by a WHACK and a SCREECH.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh I hit it! Yes, I hit it! Did anybody see
that? Hiccup’s victory is short-lived. A Monstrous Nightmare appears,
slithering up over the lip of the cliff.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Except for you. ON STOICK, holding down the
netted Nadders. He hears a familiar HOLLER and looks up to see… HICCUP
running through the PLAZA, SCREAMING, with the NIGHTMARE fast on his
heels. Alarmed, Stoick abandons the Nadders and runs off.</p>
<p>****: DO NOT let them escape!</p>
<p><strong>in the plaza</strong>: Vikings scatter as Hiccup dodges a
near fatal blast. The Nightmare’s sticky, Napalm-like fire splashes up
onto buildings, setting them alight. Hiccup ducks behind the last
standing brazier – the only shelter available. The Nightmare blasts it,
spraying fire all around him. Hiccup peers around the smoldering post.
No sign of the Nightmare. He turns back to find it leering at him,
blocking his escape. It takes a deep breath. Hiccup is finished.
Suddenly, Stoick LEAPS between them, tackling the Nightmare to the
ground. They tumble and wrestle, resuming their earlier fight. The
Nightmare tries to toast him, but only coughs up smoke.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: You’re all out. He smashes the Nightmare
repeatedly in the face, driving it away. It takes to the air and
disappears. Winded, Stoick turns to Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh, and there’s one more thing you need to
know…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Sorry, dad.</p>
<p>****: Okay, but I hit a Night Fury. Stoick grabs Hiccup by the back
scruff of his collar and hauls him away, fuming with embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: It’s not like the last few times, Dad. I
mean I really actually hit it. You guys were busy and I had a very clear
shot. It went down, just off Raven Point. Let’s get a search party out
there, before it–</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: –STOP! Just….stop. He releases Hiccup.
Everyone goes silent, staring expectantly.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Every time you step outside, disaster
follows. Can you not see that I have bigger problems? Winter’s almost
here and I have an entire village to feed! Hiccup looks around. All eyes
are upon him.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Between you and me, the village could do
with a little less feeding, don’t ya think? A few rotund Vikings stir
self-consciously.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: This isn’t a joke, Hiccup!</p>
<p>****: Why can’t you follow the simplest orders?</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I can’t stop myself. I see a dragon and I
have to just… kill it, you know? It’s who I am, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: You are many things, Hiccup. But a dragon
killer is not one of them. Sting. Hiccup looks around to see many nods
of agreement.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Get back to the house.</p>
<p>****: Make sure he gets there. I have his mess to clean up. Stoick
lumbers off in the opposite direction. Gobber leads Hiccup through the
walk of shame. They pass the teen fire brigade as they snicker.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Quite the performance.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: I’ve never seen anyone mess up that badly.
That helped!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Thank you, thank you. I was trying, so…
Hiccup avoids Astrid’s glare and heads up toward a large house, standing
prominently on the hill above the others.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I really did hit one.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Sure, Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: He never listens.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Well, it runs in the family.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: And when he does, it’s always with this…
disappointed scowl. Like someone skimped on the meat in his
sandwich.</p>
<p>****: Excuse me, barmaid. I’m afraid you brought me the wrong
offspring. I ordered an extra large boy with beefy arms. Extra guts and
glory on the side. This here. This is a talking fish bone.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: You’re thinking about this all wrong. It’s
not so much what you look like. It’s what’s inside that he can’t stand.
Beat.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Thank you, for summing that up. They reach
the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Look, the point is, stop trying so hard to
be something you’re not. Hiccup SIGHS heavily.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I just want to be one of you guys. Gobber
eyes him sympathetically. Hiccup turns and goes through the front door.
And straight out the back door. He hurries off into the woods,
determined.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Either we finish them or they’ll finish us!
It’s the only way we’ll be rid of them! If we find the nest and destroy
it, the dragons will leave. They’ll find another home.</p>
<p>****: One more search. Before the ice sets in.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Those ships never come back.</p>
<p>****: We’re Vikings. It’s an occupational hazard. Now who’s with me?
Stoick throws up his fist. No one follows. The crowds shifts in restless
silence. Head scratches. Eyes averted.</p>
<p>****: Today’s not good for me.</p>
<p>****: I’ve gotta do my axe returns.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Alright. Those who stay will look after
Hiccup. Hands jut into the air, volunteers galore. Enthusiastic murmurs
of prep and packing fill the room.</p>
<p><strong>phlegma the fierce</strong>: To the ships!</p>
<p><strong>spitelout</strong>: I’m with you Stoick!</p>
<p>****: That’s more like it. The Vikings rush for the door, leaving
Gobber and Stoick alone. Gobber gulps back the contents of his tankard
attachment and scrapes back the bench.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: I’ll pack my undies.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: No, I need you to stay and train some new
recruits.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Oh, perfect. And while I’m busy, Hiccup can
cover the stall. Molten steel, razor sharp blades, lots of time to
himself…what could possibly go wrong? Stoick sinks onto the bench beside
Gobber, his brow burdened.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: What am I going to do with him Gobber?</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Put him in training with the others.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: No, I’m serious.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: So am I. Stoick turns to him, glaring.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: He’d be killed before you let the first
dragon out of its cage.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Oh, you don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: I do know that, actually.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: No, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: No, actually I do.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: No you don’t!</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Listen! You know what he’s like. From the
time he could crawl he’s been…different. He doesn’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Has the attention span of a sparrow. I take
him fishing and he goes hunting for… for trolls.</p>
<p>****: Trolls exist! They steal your socks.</p>
<p>****: But only the left ones. What’s with that?</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: When I was a boy…</p>
<p>****: Oh here we go.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: My father told me to bang my head against a
rock and I did it. I thought it was crazy, but I didn’t question him.
And you know what happened?</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: You got a headache.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: That rock split in two. It taught me what a
Viking could do, Gobber. He could crush mountains, level forests, tame
seas! Even as a boy, I knew what I was, what I had to become.</p>
<p>****: Hiccup is not that boy.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: You can’t stop him, Stoick. You can only
prepare him.</p>
<p>****: Look, I know it seems hopeless. But the truth is you won’t
always be around to protect him. He’s going to get out there again. He’s
probably out there now. ON STOICK, as Gobber’s words hit their mark.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Uggh, the gods hate me. Some people lose
their knife or their mug. No, not me. I manage to lose an entire dragon.
Hiccup WHACKS a low-hanging branch. It SNAPS back at him, hitting him in
the face. He looks up to see a snapped tree trunk. His eyes follow it to
a long trench of up-turned earth. He follows it to a downed, black
dragon, its body and tail tangled in a bola. It appears dead. Hiccup
approaches, beaming.</p>
<p>****: Oh wow. I did it. I did it. This fixes everything.</p>
<p>****: Yes! He strikes a victory pose, planting his foot on the fallen
Night Fury.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I have brought down this mighty beast! It
suddenly shifts.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Whoa! Hiccup springs back, terrified. He
turns his blade on it. Rattled, Hiccup creeps along the length of the
weak, wounded dragon, dagger poised to strike. As he reaches the head,
Hiccup finds the Night Fury staring coldly at him. Hiccup tries to look
away, but he’s drawn back to its unnerving, unflinching stare. With the
dragon safety tangled in the ropes, Hiccup jabs with his dagger, puffing
himself up with false bravado.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I’m going to kill you, Dragon. I’m gonna cut
out your heart and take it to my father. I’m a Viking.</p>
<p>****: I am a VIKING! Hiccup raises the dagger, determined to prove
his Viking- ness. The dragon’s labored breathing breaks Hiccup’s
clenched concentration. He opens an eye, uncertainty leaking through.
The dragon holds the stare. Something profound is exchanged. Finally,
the Night Fury closes its eye and lowers its head, resigned to its fate.
Hiccup tries to go through with it, holding the dagger aloft… fighting
himself… until finally lowering it with a frustrated sigh. He looks over
the dragon’s chaffed rope wounds.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I did this. He turns to leave. Pauses. And
glances back at the dragon, chest heaving. Hiccup GRUMBLES. He checks
over his shoulder to ensure that no one is watching… then hurries back
to cut the ropes. The Night Fury’s eye shoots open. With the dragon
watching his every move, Hiccup hurriedly saws through the bola ropes.
As the last rope falls free, the Night Fury suddenly POUNCES! In a blur,
the dragon is upon him, pinning Hiccup down, grazing his neck. Looking
like it’s about to kill him. Hiccup is paralyzed. The dragon’s breath
ruffles his hair. Hiccup opens his eyes to find the Night Fury’s
wolf-like stare boring into him. The exchange is intense, profound. The
dragon draws a deep breath, as though it’s about to torch him, then lets
out an ear-piercing scream instead. It turns and takes flight, flapping
violently through the canopy of trees. It bashes against a nearby
mountain side, recovers, and drops out of view some distance away.
Winded, Hiccup struggles to his feet, staggers a few steps, collapses to
his knees, and faints.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Hiccup.</p>
<p>****: Dad. Uh… Stoick stands, takes a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I, uh… I have to talk to you, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: I need to speak with you too, son. Hiccup
and Stoick STRAIGHTEN at the same moment.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup stoick</strong>: I’ve decided I don’t want to I think
it’s time you learn fight dragons. to fight dragons.</p>
<p>****: What? What?</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: You go first.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No, you go first.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Alright. You get your wish. Dragon training.
You start in the morning.</p>
<p>****: Oh man, I should’ve gone first. Uh, ’cause I was thinking, you
know we have a surplus of dragon-fighting Vikings, but do we have enough
bread-making Vikings, or small home</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: –You’ll need this. Stoick hands Hiccup his
axe. Hiccup avoids taking it.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I don’t want to fight dragons.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Come on. Yes, you do.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Rephrase. Dad I can’t kill dragons.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: But you will kill dragons.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No, I’m really very extra sure that I
won’t.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: It’s time Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Can you not hear me?</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: This is serious son! Stoick forces the axe
into Hiccup’s hands. Its weight drags him down. He looks up to see
Stoick under-lit with firelight.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: When you carry this axe… you carry all of us
with you. Which means you walk like us. You talk like us. You think like
us. No more of…</p>
<p>****: … this.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: You just gestured to all of me.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Deal?</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: This conversation is feeling very
one-sided.</p>
<p><strong>deal?!</strong>: Hiccup glances at the axe in his hands. It’s
a no-win argument.</p>
<p>****: Deal. Satisfied, Stoick grabs his helmet and duffel bag… and
heads for the door.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Good. Train hard. I’ll be back.
Probably.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: And I’ll be here. Maybe. Stoick heads out
the door, leaving Hiccup holding the axe.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Welcome to dragon training! The recruits
file through the gate, and out onto the arena floor. They take it in
like gladiators entering the colosseum. The walls are covered in
scorched silhouettes of blasted Vikings. It’s a grim yet awe-inspiring
place.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: No turning back.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: I hope I get some serious burns.</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: I’m hoping for some mauling, like on my
shoulder or lower back.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Yeah, it’s only fun if you get a scar out of
it.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yeah, no kidding, right? Pain. Love it. The
recruits turn to see Hiccup behind them. Groans all around.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Oh great. Who let him in?</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Let’s get started! The recruit who does best
will win the honor of killing his first dragon in front of the entire
village.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: Hiccup already killed a Night Fury, so
does that disqualify him or…? The recruits LAUGH and chatter in the
background.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Can I transfer to the class with the cool
Vikings? Gobber throws a supportive arm around Hiccup and ushers him
along.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Don’t worry. You’re small and you’re weak.
That’ll make you less of a target. They’ll see you as sick or insane and
go after the more Viking-like teens instead. GOBBER stick him in line
with the others and continues on toward five massive reinforced doors.
Terrible ROARS and BELLOWS issue from within.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Behind these doors are just a few of the
many species you will learn to fight. Fishlegs bounces and giggles with
excitement, barely able to contain himself.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: The Deadly Nadder.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Speed eight. Armor sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: The Hideous Zippleback.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Plus eleven stealth. Times two.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: The Monstrous Nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Firepower fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: The Terrible Terror.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Attack eight. Venom twelve.</p>
<p>****: And…the Gronckle.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Jaw strength, eight. Gobber pulls a lever,
raising the cross beam on the last of the doors.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: Whoa, wait! Aren’t you gonna teach us
first!?</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: I believe in learning on the job. BAM! A
GRONCKLE thunders out of its cave, charging into the ring like an irate
rhino. The recruits scramble in every direction. Except for Ruffnut and
Tuffnut who rush toward it, like pumped-up rodeo clowns.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Today is about survival. If you get blasted,
you’re dead. Quick, what’s the first thing you’re going to need?</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: A doctor?</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Plus five speed?</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: A shield.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Shields. Go. The recruits scramble for
shields, finding them scattered around the ring.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Your most important piece of equipment is
your shield. If you must make a choice between a sword or a shield, take
the shield. Hiccup STRUGGLES to lift his. Gobber helps him and sends him
running. Ruff and Tuff stand amidst a dozen shields. But only one has a
skull painted on it. They both grab it.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Get your hands off my shield!</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: There are like a million shields!</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Take that one, it has a flower on it. Girls
like flowers. Ruffnut uses the shield to BASH Tuffnut in the face. He
doesn’t let go.</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: Ooops, now this one has blood on it. The
Gronckle takes aim at the distracted twins. Blam! The shield is blasted
out of both of their hands. Tuff and Ruff SPIN like tops and go
down.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Tuffnut, Ruffnut, you’re out!</p>
<p>****: What?!</p>
<p>****: What?! The Gronckle scoops up a pile of rocks and SWALLOWS them
back. The teens gather on the far side of the ring.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Those shields are good for another thing.
Noise. Make lots of it to throw off a dragon’s aim. The kids scoop up
weapons and begin hammering on their shields. The Gronckle shakes its
head at the clatter.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: All dragons have a limited number of shots.
How many does a Gronckle have?</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: Five!</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: No, six.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Correct, six. That’s one for each of
you!</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: I really don’t think my parents</p>
<p><strong>would–</strong>: BAM! Fishlegs has his shield blasted
away.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Fishlegs, out. Gobber spots Hiccup hiding
from the Gronckle’s molten slugs.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Hiccup, get in there! ON ASTRID bouncing on
her heels, ready to dodge a blast. Snotlout appears, trying to hit on
her.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: So anyway I’m moving into my parents’
basement. You should come by sometime to work out. You look like you
work out– She cartwheels out of the way, allowing a shot to shoot past
her and hit Snotlout’s shield. He’s blasted onto his back.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Snotlout! You’re done! Astrid ROLLS to a
stop beside Hiccup, who stirs awkwardly, trying to look cool.</p>
<p>****: So, I guess it’s just you and me huh?</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: No. Just you. Astrid ROLLS away. A
split-second later a lava slug knocks Hiccup’s shield clear off of his
arm. Hiccup is exposed.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: One shot left! Hiccup panics and chases
after his shield as it rolls across the ring. The sudden movement sends
the Gronckle chasing after him, leaving Astrid in the clear.</p>
<p>****: Hiccup! The Gronckle drives straight toward Hiccup, pinning him
against the wall. It opens its mouth and cocks its tail, ready to fire
point-blank. Gobber lunges in and hooks the Gronckle’s mouth at the last
second, causing its head to jerk back and fire against the stone wall
above Hiccup’s head.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: And that’s six! Gobber wrestles the irate
Gronckle back into his pen.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Go back to bed, ya overgrown sausage! You’ll
get another chance, don’t you worry. Slam! Lock. Gobber turns to the
recruits.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Remember… a dragon will always,</p>
<p>****: always go for the kill. He hoists Hiccup to his feet and walks
off. Hiccup looks overhead to see a steaming pit in the solid stone
wall.</p>
<p>****: So…why didn’t you? He drops the bola and presses on in the
direction it flew off. He drops into a rocky crevice and follows it to
an… ISOLATED COVE complete with a pristine spring pool. He scans the
high stone walls… then notices a single black SCALE on the ground. He
crouches and picks it up, studying it.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Well this was stupid. SUDDENLY, the NIGHT
FURY blasts past him. Hiccup recoils, watching the massive beast
struggle to climb the walls. It flaps violently, then peels away to a
rough landing. The dragon is trapped. Hiccup grins, excited to see it
again, and slips closer. He watches as the dragon, exhausted and
frustrated, leaps into the air, beating its wings furiously. Again and
again, it rolls uncontrolled and CRASHES heavily. As if remembering to
snap a photo, Hiccup pulls a leather- bound book and flips past drawings
of weapons to a blank page. He sketches the dragon quickly, desperate to
record the image. The Fury claws at the steep rock walls, trying climb
out of the cove. It SLIPS and falls hard, crushing several saplings. The
Fury rolls back to his feet and slowly crawls to the water’s edge. He
spots fish in the shallow water and snaps at them… but comes up empty.
He lowers his head, looking weakened.</p>
<p>****: Why don’t you just…fly away? ON HICCUP as he spots the problem.
He adjusts his drawing, carefully erasing one half of the dragon’s tail.
He accidentally drops the charcoal stick. It rolls off of the rock
outcropping that hides him from view and bounces into the cove. TINK.
TINK. TINK. The Night Fury raises his head, spotting Hiccup. They
exchange a profound, unflinching stare.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Alright. Where did Astrid go wrong in the
ring today? The recruits are seated at a table, eating dinner by the
glow of the fire pit.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: I mistimed my summersault dive. It was
sloppy. It threw off my reverse tumble. Eye rolls from the group.</p>
<p>****: Yeah. We noticed.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: No, no, you were great. That was so
‘Astrid’.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: She’s right, you have to be tough on
yourselves. CREAK. All eyes turn to Hiccup, entering the hall,
sheepishly. Gobber glares at him.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Where did Hiccup go wrong? He tries to take
a seat at the table…</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: He showed up.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: He didn’t get eaten. … but the recruits
keep closing the gaps. Rolling his eyes, Hiccup sits at the vacant table
next to them.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: He’s never where he should be.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Thank you, Astrid. Gobber stands.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: You need to live and breathe this stuff.
Gobber lays a giant book in the center of the table.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: The dragon manual. Everything we know about
every dragon we know of. A RUMBLE of thunder shakes the hall. Rain pours
down outside.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: No attacks tonight. Study up. Gobber EXITS
into the storm, leaving the teens staring at the book.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Wait, you mean read?</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: While we’re still alive?</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: Why read words when you can just kill the
stuff the words tell you stuff about?</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Oh! I’ve read it like, seven times.
There’s this water dragon that sprays boiling water at your face. And
there’s this other one that buries itself for like a week… The teens
stare as Fishlegs goes on too long.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Yeah, that sounds great. There was a chance
I was going to read that…</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: …but now… Snotlout gets up to go.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: You guys read, I’ll go kill stuff. The
others follow, with Fishlegs in tow.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Oh and there’s this other one that has
these spines that look like trees… Astrid is the last to go.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: So I guess we’ll share–</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Read it. She pushes it toward him and
leaves.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: All mine then. Wow, so okay. I’ll</p>
<p><strong>see you–</strong>: Slam.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>on hiccup’s hand</strong>: OPENING the massive book. Thunder
BOOMS outside. The hall is vacant and dark, but for the few candles he’s
pulled together. Hiccup pours through page after page of strange and
frightening dragons.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Dragon classifications. Strike class. Fear
class. Mystery class. Hiccup turns the page.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Thunderdrum. This reclusive dragon inhabits
sea caves and dark tide pools.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: When startled, the Thunderdrum produces a
concussive sound that can kill a man at close range. Extremely
dangerous. Kill on sight. Hiccup’s eyes drift to a lurid illustration of
decapitated Vikings. Another page, another dragon.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Timberjack. This gigantic creature has razor
sharp wings that can slice through full grown trees…extremely dangerous.
Kill on sight. The illustrations seem to take on a life of their own,
shifting and squirming in the candlelight.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Scauldron. Sprays scalding water at its
victim. Extremely dangerous. The storm outside rages against the
shuttered windows. Hiccup is startled, but presses on.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Changewing. Even newly hatched dragons can
spray acid. Kill on sight. He begins flipping through the pages. A blur
of dragons…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Gronckle. Zippleback. The Skrill. Bone
Knapper. Whispering Death. Burns its victims. Buries its victims. Chokes
its victims. Turns its victims inside-out. Extremely dangerous.
Extremely dangerous. Kill on sight. Kill on sight. Kill on sight… Hiccup
finally lands upon the page he’s been looking for.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Night Fury. It’s BLANK – no image, save for
a few, sparse details.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Speed unknown. Size unknown. The unholy
offspring of lightning and death itself.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Never engage this dragon. Your only chance,
hide and pray it does not find you. Hiccup pulls his sketchbook out of
his vest and opens it to his drawing of Toothless. He lays it over the
book’s blank page and considers it. CLOSE ON the drawing of
Toothless…</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: I can almost smell them. They’re close.
Steady. Stoick raises his gaze to… AN EPIC FOG BANK, towering from sky
to sea like a bruised, daunting curtain, beyond which nothing is
visible. The three ships drift alongside it, skirting its solid edge,
looking for an opening. ON DECK the crewmen mill nervously, all too
aware of what Stoick is considering.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Take us in. The helmsman steers Stoick’s
ship into the fog. The men draw their weapons, prepping for the
worst.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Hard to port… for Helheim’s gate. The first
ship disappears into the whiteout, followed by the other two.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: You know, I just happened to notice the book
had nothing on Night Furies. Is there another book? Or a sequel? Maybe a
little Night Fury pamphlet? KABLAM! A blast takes the axe head off of
Hiccup’s hilt, leaving a smoking hole behind him. Hiccup YELPS and
RUNS.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: FOCUS Hiccup! You’re not even trying. CUT
BACK to reveal a Deadly Nadder, loose in a maze-like arrangement of
moveable walls. Gobber calls orders from above.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Today… is all about attack. The Nadder hops
from wall to wall, sending the recruits scurrying.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Nadders are quick and light on their feet.
Your job is to be quicker and lighter. The teens move in, stumbling over
Hiccup and his unwieldy shield. The Nadder spots Fishlegs’ ample rear
hiding behind a wall. It whips its tail of spikes. Fishlegs SCREAMS and
lifts an entire wall to shield himself from the spray.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: I’m really beginning to question your
teaching methods.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Look for its blind spot. Every dragon has
one. Find it, hide in it, and strike.</p>
<p>****: Do you ever bathe?</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: If you don’t like it, then just get your
own blind spot.</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: How about I give you one! Ruff and Tuff
SHOVE each other, till their movement and noise gives them away. The
Nadder ATTACKS, SNAPPING at both of them.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Blind spot? Yes. Deaf spot? Not so much.
Hiccup wanders up to Gobber, while the others dart past.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Hey, so how would one sneak up on a Night
Fury?</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: None one’s ever met one and lived to tell
the tale. Now get in there.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I know, I know, but hypothetically…</p>
<p>****: Hiccup! She puts her finger to her lips and gestures for him to
hide. A moment later, the Nadder leaps over the walls, surprising them
by landing in front of her. Astrid somersaults into its blind spot,
confusing it. She rears back to strike – just as Snotlout LEAPS IN,
protectively SWEEPING Astrid behind him.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: Watch out babe. I’ll take care of
this.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Hey! Snotlout MISSES. Astrid glares at
him.</p>
<p>****: The sun was in my eyes, Astrid. What do you want me to do,
block out the sun? I could do that, but I don’t have time right now! The
Nadder tears off after her, knocking down walls in pursuit. She leaps
and dives like a highly trained gymnast. Hiccup wanders up to Gobber
again.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: They probably take the daytime off. You
know, like a cat. Has anyone ever seen one napping?</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Hiccup!</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: –Hiccup! Hiccup spins around to see the maze
walls collapsing like dominos toward him. Astrid comes flying through
the dust and crash-lands on top of him, laying him out in a limb-tangled
mess.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Oooh! Love on the battlefield!</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: She could do better. The Nadder closes in,
emerging through the cloud of dust.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Just… let me… why don’t you… The Nadder
spins around and races back toward them like a Raptor. Astrid untangles
herself and tries to pull her axe from Hiccup’s shield… which is
attached to his limp, gangly arm. She PLANTS her foot on his torso and
YANKS the axe free, still burrowed into the shield.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Well done, Astrid. Gobber hobbles off to
wrestle the Nadder back into his cave. Hiccup gets to his feet – all
eyes are upon him. He turns to find Astrid glaring at him, winded.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Is this some kind of a joke to you? Our
parents’ war is about to become ours. Figure out which side you’re on.
She grabs her axe and stomps off. Hiccup watches, stung.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: A fish… being thrown into the cove. It
hits the ground and slides. A moment later, Hiccup peeks through a gap
in the rock, looking around cautiously. Nothing. Hiccup squeezes through
and enters the cove. A BEAT, then Hiccup hears a SNORT from behind him.
Hiccup turns to see the Night Fury, crouched on a rock like a stealthy
panther. It descends, approaching him… ready to pounce. Hiccup swallows
his fear and offers the fish. Doing so reveals the dagger at his waist.
The dragon sees it and hisses. Hiccup reaches for it, eliciting a growl.
He pauses, carefully lifts it by the handle, and tosses it away. The
dragon calms. As it approaches the fish, Hiccup notices that it’s
missing teeth.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Huh. Toothless. I could’ve sworn you had… A
set of razor sharp teeth emerge from its gums to grab the fish.
Toothless snatches and gnashes it up, swallowing it.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: … teeth. The teeth retract again. Toothless
presses closer with an expectant look. Hiccup retreats nervously.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Uh, no. No, I don’t have any more. The Fury
backs Hiccup against a rock, placing himself the same position as
before. The dragon closes in over him, staring blankly. A tense moment
passes… then Toothless regurgitates a chunk of fish onto Hiccup’s lap.
They exchange stares. Hiccup realizes what Toothless wants him to do.
Hiccup crouches slowly and squeamishly picks it up. The dragon waits
expectantly. Hiccup gags and gnaws off a bite of the slimy fish. He
forces a smile. Toothless mimics him. Amazed, Hiccup sits up and tries
to touch him. Toothless HISSES and flaps off to a crash on the other
side of the cove. He BLASTS the mossy ground to a red-hot temperature…
and curls up on it like a giant dog. He turns to find Hiccup seated
beside him. Toothless tolerates his persistent presence… until Hiccup
tries to touch his damaged tail. Toothless SNAPS at him. Hiccup takes
the hint and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: …and with one twist he took my hand and
swallowed it whole. And I saw the look on his face. I was delicious. He
must have passed the word, because it wasn’t a month before another one
of them took my leg.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Isn’t it weird to think that your hand was
inside a dragon. Like if your mind was still in control of it you could
have killed the dragon from the inside by crushing his heart or
something.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: I swear I’m so angry right now. I’ll
avenge your beautiful hand and your beautiful foot. I’ll chop off the
legs of every dragon I fight, with my face. He postures to Astrid. She
rolls her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Un-unh. It’s the wings and the tails you
really want. If it can’t fly, it can’t get away. A downed dragon is a
dead dragon.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Alright. I’m off to bed. You should be too.
Tomorrow we get into the big boys. Slowly but surely making our way up
to the Monstrous Nightmare. But who’ll win the honor of killing it? He
hobbles off. The teens reflect.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: It’s gonna be me.</p>
<p>****: It’s my destiny. See? Tuffnut rolls up his sleeve to reveal a
red dragon on his arm.</p>
<p>****: Your mom let you get a tattoo?</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: It’s not a tattoo. It’s a birthmark.</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: Okay, I’ve been stuck with you since birth,
and that was never there before.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Yes it was. You’ve just never seen me from
the left side until now.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: It wasn’t there yesterday. Is it a
birthmark or a today-mark? Hiccup gets up and walks away from the group.
Astrid watches him as he leaves the bonfire.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: … a creaking leather bellows. The stone
forge glows with every pump. Tongs pull intricate iron pieces from the
coals. They’re dropped onto the anvil, twisted, lightly hammered, and
dunked in a barrel. The pieces are carried to Hiccup’s workbench and
laid out in place on a one-to-one schematic. It’s a sketch of a
mechanical fin.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Hey Toothless. I brought breakfast. I hope
you’re hungry. Hiccup drops the basket and kicks it over. Fish spill
out.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay, that’s disgusting. Toothless
approaches, settling in to devour the feast.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Uh..we’ve got some salmon… Toothless
swallows it.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: … some nice Icelandic cod… Swallows those
too.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: … and a whole smoked eel. Toothless nabs it,
chews a few times, then spits it out. He shakes his head violently,
snorts and scrubs his massive tongue on the sand. Hiccup takes note.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No, no, no! It’s okay. Yeah, I don’t like
eel much either. Toothless focuses on the remainder. With the dragon
distracted, Hiccup unwraps his prosthetic fin and opens it like a
fan.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay. That’s it. That’s it, just stick with
good stuff. And don’t you mind me. I’ll just be back…here. Minding my
own business. Hiccup cautiously approaches the injured tail, but every
time he gets near it, Toothless sweeps it away like a cat.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: It’s okay. Hiccup drops a knee on top of the
tail. Toothless’ head juts up, slows its chewing to a halt.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay…okay.. The dragon tenses, slowly
spreading his wings. Hiccup straps the prosthetic fin in place. He
cinches the straps.</p>
<p>****: There. Not too bad. It works. Toothless BOLTS! He snaps his
massive wings and takes to the air, carrying Hiccup with him.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Woah! No! No! No! Hiccup struggles to hold
on to the tail. As the ground speeds away, Toothless immediately TIPS
into a uncontrolled bank and dive. Hiccup sees the folded fin rattling
uselessly in opposition to its flared counterpart. Flap as he may,
Toothless can’t correct his trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: It’s working! Toothless arcs just short of
the water and climbs… high into the air.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yes! Yes, I did it. He glances back at
Hiccup, busily holding the tail open while trying to hold on. They’re
going to crash. Whoomp! Hiccup is suddenly thrown from the tail in the
intense force of a turn.</p>
<p><strong>aaaaagggghhhhh!</strong>: He bounces across the water’s
surface and takes a dive. Without Hiccup to operate the tail, Toothless
does the same, plunging in a massive cannonball. Hiccup resurfaces,
roughed up, but beaming. Toothless appears seconds later.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Today is about teamwork. Work together and
you might survive. ON A DOUBLE-WIDE DOOR. Gas seeps through the cracks.
It BLASTS OPEN. A cloud of smoke engulfs the ring, swirling around the
paired-up teens. Astrid with Ruffnut. Snotlout with Tuffnut. Fishlegs
with Hiccup. All carry buckets of water, poised to throw them.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Now, a wet dragon head can’t light its fire.
The Hideous Zippleback is extra tricky. One head breathes gas, the other
head lights it. Your job is to know which is which.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Razor sharp, serrated teeth that inject
venom for pre-digestion. Prefers ambush attack, crushing its victims in
its…</p>
<p>****: Will you please stop that?</p>
<p><strong>on snotlout and tuffnut</strong>: Moving nervously through
the fog, back to back. Snotlout is singing to himself to calm his
nerves.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: If that dragon shows either of his faces,
I’m gonna– –There! Snotlout and Tuffnut HURL their water into the
fog.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: It’s us, idiots. Astrid and Ruffnut are
soaked.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Your butts are getting bigger. We thought
you were a dragon.</p>
<p>****: Not that there’s anything wrong with a dragon-esque figure.
Astrid ELBOWS Snotlout in the face. Ruffnut DROPS Tuffnut with a PUNCH
to the throat.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Wait. They FREEZE. A tail SWEEPS out of the
fog, taking them down. Their buckets spill.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Oh, I’m hurt. I am very much hurt.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Chances of survival are dwindling into
single digits now…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Look out! A Zippleback head emerges out of
the smoke. Fishlegs hurls his water at it, completely dousing the head.
It leers and opens its mouth, spewing gas into the area.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Oh. Wrong head. GAS FLOWS around their
legs. Fishlegs flees in a panic.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Fishlegs! Beat. A clicking sound comes from
behind them. Sparks flash in the smoke.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Now, Hiccup! The other head sweeps out of
the smoke. Hiccup hurls his water with all his might. It arcs and drops
short of the dragon’s sparking mouth. The dragon grins, savoring the
kill.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh, come on!</p>
<p><strong>run, hiccup!</strong>: Gobber COVERS his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Hiccup! Beat. The Zippleback hesitates.
SNIFFS. Then retreats. The teens get to their feet, watching transfixed.
Gobber peeks through his fingers to see…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: BACK! BACK! BACK! Now don’t you make me tell
you again! The Zippleback retreats through its door and into its cave,
hissing.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yes, that’s right. Back into your cage.
Hiccup slyly OPENS his vest, revealing the spotted smoked EEL from
earlier. He TOSSES it inside the door, then SLAMS it shut.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Now think about what you’ve done. Hiccup
turns to the teens and Gobber. They stare, slack-jawed</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay! So are we done? Because I’ve got some
things I need to… Hiccup jogs out of the ring, past the speechless
group.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yep…see you tomorrow. Astrid SNEERS.
Something’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yeah! Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Hey Hiccup, I’ve never seen a Gronkle to
that before.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: How’d you do that?</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: It was really cool. He squirms and invents
an excuse.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I left my axe back in the ring. He turns and
hurries back.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: You guys go on ahead and I’ll catch up with
you. Astrid watches, suspicious.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Hey Hiccup!</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: What was that? Some kind of trick? What
did you do?</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Hiccup, you’re totally going to come in
first, there’s no question.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Meet the Terrible Terror.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Ha. It’s like the size of my– Tuffnut is
taken down in a blur.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Get it off! Get it off! Oh! I’m hurt, I am
very much hurt! Hiccup stops the Terrible Terror with the same
light-patch trick he used earlier with Toothless. The tiny dragon
retreats back to it’s cage. The teens approach him yet again as Astrid
looks on with suspicion.</p>
<p>****: Wow, he’s better than you ever were.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh, great.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Hiccup. Hiccup nods, trying to look casual.
Once the coast is clear, he covertly steers Toothless into the
Blacksmith’s stall. Toothless PRESSES himself inside, rooting through
stuff and making a racket. Astrid, walking nearby, is alerted.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Hiccup? Hiccup FREEZES. Then frantically
tries to pry the ring off the saddle hook. It won’t budge.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Are you in there? Too late - she’s right
outside. ON ASTRID walking along the outside of the Blacksmith’s. Hiccup
JUMPS OUT the window and CLOSES the shutters behind him. Hiccup’s
harness line is stretched through the window, still attached to
Toothless’ saddle.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Astrid. Hey! Hi Astrid. Hi Astrid. Hi
Astrid.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: I normally don’t care what people do, but
you’re acting weird. Well, weirder. Toothless spots a nearby sheep and
makes a move toward it. As a result, Hiccup is suddenly PULLED TIGHT
against the window shutters. He STRIKES A POSE to compensate… then gets
PULLED THROUGH the shutters. They snap back in Astrid’s face. Astrid
reopens them and finds nothing but an empty stall. In the distance,
Toothless and Hiccup slip off unseen.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Where are the other ships?</p>
<p><strong>spitelout</strong>: You don’t want to know. Stoick lumbers
past Gobber, leaving him staring at the trashed ship.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Well, I trust you found the nest at
least?</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Not even close.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Ah. Excellent. Gobber follows Stoick up the
ramp and snags his duffle bag with his hook appendage, sharing the
burden.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: I hope you had a little more success than
me.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Well, if by success, you mean that your
parenting troubles are over with, then… yes. Stoick stops. What does
that mean? A group of merry villagers rush past.</p>
<p><strong>viking #1</strong>: Congratulations Stoick! Everyone is so
relieved.</p>
<p><strong>viking #2</strong>: Out with the old and in with the new,
right?!</p>
<p><strong>viking #3</strong>: No one will miss that old nuisance!</p>
<p><strong>viking #4</strong>: The village is throwing a party to
celebrate! Stoick is stunned, overwhelmed by the insensitivity. He turns
to Gobber.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: He’s… gone?</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Yeah…most afternoons. But who can blame him?
I mean the life of a celebrity is very rough. He can barely walk through
the village without being swarmed by his new fans. Stoick is doubly
confused.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Hiccup?</p>
<p>****: Who would’ve thought, eh? He has this…way with the beasts.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay there bud, we’re gonna take this nice
and slow. Hiccup checks a leather cheat sheet, clipped onto his harness.
Inscribed upon it are several tail positions and their pedal position
equivalents.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Here we go. Here we go…position three, no
four. He presses the pedal, causing the tail to flare. They roll off
into an arcing bank, gloriously lit by the late afternoon sun. Hiccup
tucks tight against his neck, thrilled that his new harness and vest are
holding. The foot controls make the tail appendage quick and responsive.
He watches Toothless’ every fluctuation, trying to match it with the
prosthetic. Hiccup sizes up a target – a towering arch of stone, rising
from the sea.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Alright, it’s go time. It’s go time. They
dive toward it, lining up to pass through the arch.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Come on. Come on buddy. Come on buddy! They
zip through the arch. A perfect maneuver.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yeah! Yes, it worked! The triumph is
short-lived. They smack into one of several sea stacks as Hiccup tries
to keep up with the turns.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Sorry. They hurtle into another rock pillar.
Toothless grumbles.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: My fault. Toothless swats him with his ‘ear’
plate.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I’m on it.</p>
<p>****: Position four, no three. They pierce the clouds. For the first
time, Hiccup can see the whole of the island below them. It shrinks with
every passing second. He SWALLOWS hard and tightens his grip on the
handles.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yeah! Go baby! Yes! Oh, this is amazing! The
wind in my… He spots the leather guide tearing free in the
turbulence.</p>
<p><strong>… cheat sheet! stop!!</strong>: Hiccup grabs frantically for
the airborne sheet…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh gods! Oh no! Without Hiccup, the tail
loses control. Hiccup and Toothless spiral downward. Toothless FIGHTS to
get back under Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Alright, okay. You just gotta kinda angle
yourself. No, no…come back down towards me. Come back down– Hiccup
extends his arms and legs, giving himself as much surface area as he
can. He angles back towards Toothless as the tumbling dragon WHACKS
Hiccup with his wing. After a few more misses, Hiccup finally GRABS HOLD
of the harness and manages to lock in – just in time to pull Toothless
out of his dive… barely shy of the tree tops. They careen past the
wooded cliff and directly into a treacherous slalom course of jutting
sea stacks. Hiccup pulls the cheat sheet from his teeth and attempts to
check positions. It flaps violently in the turbulence, making it
impossible. With no time to think, Hiccup throws it away and steers
Toothless’ tail on instinct… with perfect intuition. Together, they
manage a tight, hair-rasing series of split- second turns, making it to
the open water, unscathed. Hiccup takes a breath and glances back at the
death-defying obstacle course, now safely behind them. He beams,
relieved. He sits back and throws his arms up in victory.</p>
<p><strong>yeeahhh!</strong>: Toothless concurs with a happy SQUEAL and
a fireball. Hiccup’s glee turn to dread as they fly directly into
it.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Ah, come on.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Uh..no thanks.</p>
<p>****: I’m good. Several Terrible Terrors land like seagulls, hissing
and nipping at each other as they approach Toothless’ pile of fish. One
grabs the regurgitated fish head and drags it away. Another attempts to
steal it from him. They face off and last fire balls at each other to
settle the fight. Hiccup and Toothless watch, amused. That is until…
Toothless spots one of his fish leaving the pile. A stealthy Terrible
Terror is exposed as the thief. They tug on the fish, and it snaps back
into Toothless’ mouth. He swallows it back tauntingly. Irate, the little
dragon paws at the ground and blast Toothless. He opens his mouth, the
gas hiss comes, and Toothless fires a tiny flame straight into its
mouth, causing the gas to backfire into the little dragon. It coughs up
smoke and staggers away, looking ill. Hiccup laughs.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Not so fireproof on the inside, are you?
Hiccup throws the hapless Terror his freshly cooked fish.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Here you go. The appreciative little dragon
gulps down the meal and approaches Hiccup cautiously. He curls up next
to him. Hiccup is amazed.</p>
<p>****: Everything we know about you guys is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Dad! You’re back! He skirts the bench,
blocking Stoick’s view of Toothless, the prosthetic fin, and other
drawings.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Gobber’s not here, so… He strikes an
awkwardly casual pose, trying to cover up as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: I know. I came looking for you.</p>
<p>****: You did?</p>
<p>****: You’ve been keeping secrets. Hiccup’s legs give out. He slides,
dragging the table’s contents with him.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I…have?</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Just how long did you think you could hide
it from me?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know what you’re…</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Nothing happens on this island without me
hearing about it.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: So.</p>
<p>****: Let’s talk about that dragon. Blood drains from Hiccup’s
face.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh gods. Dad I’m so sorry. I was going to
tell you. I just didn’t know how to– Stoick starts laughing. Big,
booming. Hiccup stares, baffled.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: You’re not…upset?</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: What?! I was hoping for this!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Uh…you were?</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: And believe me, it only gets better! Just
wait til you spill a Nadder’s guts for the first time. Hiccup’s elated
expression sinks.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: And mount your first Gronckle head on a
spear. What a feeling! Stoick laughs and smacks Hiccup on the shoulder,
sending him into the wall.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: You really had me going there, son. All
those years of the worst Viking Berk has ever seen! Odin, it was rough.
I almost gave up on you! Hiccup gets back up, grimacing in the irony of
it all.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: And all the while, you were holding out on
me! Thor almighty! Stoick grabs a stool and sits. His massive frame
nearly fills the tiny room.</p>
<p>****: Ahhhhh. With you doing so well in the ring, we finally have
something to talk about. Pregnant pause. Hiccup averts his eyes
nervously. Stoick adjusts, awkwardly clearing his throat. After a long,
uncomfortable silence…</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Oh, I… brought you something. He presents a
horned helmet.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: To keep you safe in the ring.</p>
<p>****: Wow. Thanks. Hiccup accepts it, looking it over.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Your mother would’ve wanted you to have
it.</p>
<p>****: It’s half of her breast plate. Stoick taps his own helmet and
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Matching set. Keeps her close, y’know?
Hiccup eyes the mismatched helmets, grimacing.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Wear it proudly. You deserve it. You’ve held
up your end of the deal. Stoick beams with pride. Hiccup squirms. He
forces a YAWN.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I should really get to bed.</p>
<p>****: Yes! Good! Okay. Good talk. See you back at the house. We
should do this again. I’m Great. Thanks for stopping glad I stopped by,
I hope you by. And for the… the uh, like the hat. breast hat.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Well..uh..good night. Stoick leaves the room
awkwardly, leaving Hiccup looking more burdened than ever.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Stay out of my way! I’m winning this
thing.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Please, by all means. She darts off, CLOSING
FAST on the dragon. The crowd above cheers her on.</p>
<p><strong>viking in crowd</strong>: You got it Astrid! Hiccup stands
and looks around. Amidst the crowd of onlookers, Stoick watches keenly,
beaming with pride. He locks eyes with Hiccup, giving him a nod of
encouragement. Hiccup adjusts his new helmet and forces a half-hearted
smile. Unbeknownst to Hiccup, the Gronckle spots him and makes a bee-
line toward him.</p>
<p><strong>back to astrid</strong>: … as she catches her breath behind a
barrier. She scowls, focused, determined.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: This time. This time for sure.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Aaaaaaaaaa… And as she clears the barriers,
she sees that Hiccup has already laid the Gronckle out.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: …aaaaaaauGGGGGHHHHHHHH! No! No! Hiccup
shrugs, as unhappy with the situation as she is.</p>
<p><strong>munge bucket!</strong>: A loud CLACK ring out. From the crowd
above, Gothi, the village elder, steps forward, tapping her staff.
Everyone lights up excitedly.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Wait! Wait!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: So, later. Gobber snags Hiccup as he
attempts to leave.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Not so fast.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I’m kinda late for–</p>
<p>****: What? Late for what exactly? Stoick holds out his hands to
silence the jabbering crowd.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Okay quiet down. The elder has decided.
Thrilled, Gobber stands behind Hiccup and Astrid. He points to Astrid as
the crowd waits in silent anticipation. Gothi shakes her head ‘no.’ The
crowd ‘Oooohs.’ Gobber then points to Hiccup. The elder nods an
affirmative ‘yes.’ The crowd erupts in cheers. Astrid turns a seething,
deadly glare on Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: You’ve done it! You’ve done it, Hiccup! You
get to kill the dragon!</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Ha, ha! That’s my boy! Hiccup is hoisted
onto the recruits’ shoulders and carried out to the cheering
spectators…</p>
<p>****: Heh, heh. Oh yeah! Yes! I can’t wait. I am so…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: … leaving. We’re leaving. Let’s pack up.
Looks like you and me are taking a little vacation, forever. Toothless
is nowhere in sight. Hiccup sets down his basket and opens it up, his
head clouded with troubles.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh..man… SHINK! Hiccup looks up to the sound
of… ASTRID, sitting on the rock right in front of him, sharpening her
axe.</p>
<p>****: Aggh! What the–</p>
<p>****: What are you doing here? She hops off the rock and back him
down, spinning her axe threateningly. Hiccup’s eyes dart around
nervously, searching for Toothless.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: I want to know what’s going on. No one just
gets as good as you do. Especially you. Start talking! Are you training
with someone?</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Uh…training? She grabs him by his
odd-looking harness.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: It better not involve… this.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I know this looks really bad, but you
see…this is, uh… They hear a RUSTLE coming from the other side of the
cove. Astrid DROPS Hiccup to the ground and sets off to investigate.</p>
<p>****: You’re right! You’re right. I’m through with the lies. I’ve
been making… outfits. So you got me. It’s time everyone knew. Drag me
back. Go ahead. Here we go. He puts her hand back on his harness,
getting her to ‘drag him back.’ Astrid BENDS Hiccups hand backwards,
driving him down.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: AAAAUUGGGHHH! Why would you do that?!</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: That’s for the lies. Astrid pounces the hilt
of her axe off of Hiccup’s laid-out body.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: And THAT’S for everything else. Hiccup’s
YELP is answered with A GROWL, coming from the other side of the cove.
Astrid looks up to see… A NIGHT FURY. Toothless pounces toward them,
snarling.</p>
<p>****: Oh man. She dives onto Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Get down! Run! Run! Astrid pulls her axe,
ready to take on Toothless.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No. It’s okay! It’s okay… Toothless pulls up
short and lands hard, SPRAYING Astrid with sand.</p>
<p>****: She’s a friend. Toothless snorts in disagreement. Astrid is
frozen. Toothless looks from her to Hiccup and back to her,
confused.</p>
<p>****: You just scared him.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: I scared him!? Hiccup makes a “be quiet”
motion.</p>
<p>****: Who is him?</p>
<p><strong>hiccup.</strong>: Astrid, Toothless. Toothless, Astrid.
Astrid backs away, eyeing Hiccup and Toothless together with pure
disgust. She turns and RUNS for the village.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: We’re dead. Satisfied with Astrid’s
departure, Toothless turns away.</p>
<p>****: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Oh great Odin’s ghost, this is it!</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Hiccup! Get me down from here!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: You have to give me a chance to explain.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: I’m not listening to ANYTHING you have to
say!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Then I won’t speak. Just let me show you.
Hiccup extends a hand.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Please, Astrid. She eyes him and the dragon,
then the ground far, far below. After a moment, she swats Hiccup’s
outstretched hand away and reluctantly climbs over the pedal, lines, and
harness. She settles behind Hiccup, avoiding as much contact as
possible.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Now get me down.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Toothless? Down. Gently. Toothless leers
mischievously. He spreads his wings slowly. With a WHOP, they fill with
the updraft. Toothless releases the tree, tucks in his legs, and HOVERS
in place.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: See? Nothing to be afraid of. Toothless
suddenly LAUNCHES straight upward. Astrid SCREAMS. The acceleration is
tremendous. Every downbeat bucks the saddle, heaving them into the sky,
doubling their speed like a rocket. Astrid is thrown backward. She
SCREAMS and hugs Hiccup for dear life, squeezing the breath out of
him.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Toothless! What is wrong with you?! Bad
dragon! He’s not usually like this. Oh no…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Toothless, what are you doing?! We need her
to like us! Toothless rockets skyward and begins tumbling head over
tail.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: And now the spinning. Thank you for nothing
you useless reptile. Astrid clamps her hand over her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Okay! I’m sorry! I’m sorry! Just get me off
of this thing. Astrid is defeated, her aggressive energy gone.
Satisfied, Toothless relents. They level off and head up into the
clouds. Astrid opens her eyes again, and looks out over a world she’d
never dreamed of. She reaches out and touches clouds, pierces columns
ablaze in golden hues, and floats over a vast, alien sky- scape. Her
terror is replaced by wonder. She grins, despite herself. Toothless
rises above a blanket of clouds…</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Alright I admit it. This is pretty cool.
It’s… amazing.</p>
<p>****: He’s amazing. Astrid carefully reaches down and pats Toothless’
side.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: So what now? Hiccup groans. It’s a problem
without an answer.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Hiccup, your final exam is tomorrow. You
know you’re going to have to kill…</p>
<p>****: … kill a dragon.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Don’t remind me. A strange, unearthly din
approaches. Toothless’ ear plates suddenly stand on end. Panicked, he
abruptly dives, dipping into cloud cover.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Toothless! What’s happening? What is it?
Toothless BARKS at him. ‘Quiet!’ Suddenly, out of the dense cloud, a
Monstrous Nightmare emerges.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Get down! Hiccup and Astrid duck. The
Nightmare calls out. A Zippleback appears to the other side of
Toothless, boxing him in.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p>****: Toothless. You’ve got to get us out of here, bud. Toothless
HISSES.</p>
<p>****: It looks like they’re hauling in their kill. The Zippleback
eyes them ravenously.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: What does that make us? The dragons BANK and
dive in formation, plummeting through the thickening fog and weaving
between towering, craggy sea stacks. They emerge at the base of a
massive volcanic caldera, glowing with rivulets of lava. The flock of
dragons fall into rank, funneling through a crack, and zipping through a
winding tunnel. It gives way to a vast, steamy inner chamber, tiered
with pocky shelves. Dragons of all breeds lay about, nested in hordes.
The arriving dragons fly in, dropping the fish and game into a central
pit, glowing red and shrouded in mist. Hiccup is amazed.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: What my dad wouldn’t give to find this.
Toothless peels away from the procession, landing on a small shadowy
shelf to keep a low-profile. Hiccup and Astrid peek around, taking in
the busy hive of sorts. They watch as the food continues to be dropped
into the pit.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: It’s satisfying to know that all of our food
has been dumped down a hole.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: They’re not eating any of it.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: What is that? The monstrous beast SNIFFS the
air, seemingly aware of them. It nears the ledge where Toothless is
hiding… and ROARS. Several dragons take flight in fear.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Alright buddy, we gotta get out of here.
Now! Toothless takes flight, barely evading the monster’s snapping jaws.
The behemoth dragon lunges for them, snatching a Zippleback out of the
air instead. Toothless disappears into the winged exodus as thousands of
dragons flee the caldera in fear.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: No, no, it totally makes sense. It’s like a
giant beehive. They’re the workers… and that’s their queen. It controls
them. She leaps off of Toothless and runs toward the village.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Let’s find your dad.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No, no! Not yet. They’ll… kill
Toothless.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Astrid, we have to think this through
carefully. Astrid eyes him, incredulous.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Hiccup, we just discovered the dragons’
nest…the thing we’ve been after since Vikings first sailed here. And you
want to keep it a secret? To protect your pet dragon? Are you serious?
Hiccup stands firm, resolute.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yes. Astrid’s taken aback.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>****: Then what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Just give me until tomorrow. I’ll figure
something out.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Okay. Astrid PUNCHES Hiccup in the arm.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: That’s for kidnapping me. Hiccup looks to
Toothless for support. Toothless SNORTS, dismissive. Astrid grabs him.
He braces for another hit. She KISSES Hiccup on the cheek.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: That’s for, everything else. In the awkward
wake of the moment, Astrid hurries off… leaving Hiccup RUBBING his
cheek, stunned. Toothless hobbles up, eyeing him.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Well, I can show my face in public
again.</p>
<p>****: If someone had told me that in a few short weeks, Hiccup would
go from being, well… Hiccup, to placing first in dragon training… I
would’ve tied him to a mast and shipped him off for fear he’d gone mad.
Yes! And you know it!</p>
<p>****: But here we are. And no one’s more surprised… ON HICCUP
standing at the entrance to the ring, listening, looking burdened.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: … or more proud than I am. Today, my boy
becomes a Viking. TODAY, HE</p>
<p><strong>becomes one of us!</strong>: CHEERS and ROARS. Astrid
approaches Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Be careful with that dragon.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: It’s not the dragon I’m worried about.</p>
<p>****: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Put an end to this. She eyes him,
dubious.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I have to try.</p>
<p>****: Astrid. If something goes wrong… just make sure they don’t find
Toothless.</p>
<p>****: I will. Just promise me it won’t go wrong. Hiccup can’t. Gobber
approaches.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: It’s time, Hiccup. Knock him dead. Hiccup
puts his helmet on and enters the ring.</p>
<p><strong>on the teens</strong>: HOOTING and HOLLERING from the
stands.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Show ’em how it’s done, my man! Hiccup
locks eyes with Stoick. Stoick nods with a smile. Hiccup returns a
half-smile. Takes a deep breath. He hoists a shield onto his forearm and
selects his weapon from a rack of many – a small dagger.</p>
<p>****: Hrmph. I would’ve gone for the hammer. Hiccup turns to face a
bolted, heavy door. Takes a deep breath.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I’m ready. The door bolt is raised. The
crowd grows quiet… Beat. BOOM! The doors blast open with a stream of
sticky fire. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, coated in flames. It
tears out of its cave like an irate bull – as the crowd roars and jeers.
It climbs the walls and chain enclosure like a bat, hissing at the
provoking crowd and blasting fire.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: What is he doing? The dragon presses closer,
snorting. Hiccup extends his open hand. It snarls.</p>
<p>****: It’s okay. It’s okay. The dragon continues to pace, focused on…
HICCUP’S HELMET. Hiccup realizes, then reaches up and removes it. Taking
a breath to acknowledge the point of no return, he tosses the helmet
aside. It hits the ground.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I’m not one of them. GASPS and MURMURS race
through the crowd. ON STOICK, as all eyes turn to him. He’s welling with
upset. Hiccup avoids Stoick’s glare and remains focused on the
Nightmare, holding his hand out. It paces around him, calming down.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Stop the fight.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No. I need you all to see this. The crowd
gets restless.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: They’re not what we think they are. We don’t
have to kill them.</p>
<p><strong>on toothless</strong>: His ear plates shoot up. Panic flares
in his eyes.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Out of my way!</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Hiccup! Astrid wedges her axe under the
arena gate and squeezes through.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Hiccup! She picks up a hammer and hurls it
at the Monstrous Nightmare, hitting it in the head. It turns its
attention to Astrid, and begins chasing her. Stoick raises the arena
gate, waving her toward it.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: This way! Astrid makes it through, but the
Nightmare BLASTS the doorway, cutting Hiccup off. It pounces on him and
prepares to finish him off. Suddenly, a terrible roar pierces the
din.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Night Fury! Get down! Toothless bounds over
the crowd and BLASTS a hole through the chain enclosure. He flies
through it and disappears in the boiling smoke. The Vikings rush to
railings… in time to see a flurry of wings cutting through the
dissipating smoke. Toothless and the Nightmare tumble into the clear,
locked in a toothy, vicious fight. Toothless kicks the Nightmare off and
plants himself between Hiccup and it. The Nightmare snarls, circling
them. Toothless lunges and ROARS… causing the Nightmare to relent and
back away. To everyone’s shock and horror, Hiccup gets to his feet and
grabs Toothless protectively.</p>
<p>****: Alright, Toothless, go. Get out of here! The crowd is
gob-smacked, growing livid.</p>
<p><strong>vikings</strong>: Night Fury!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Go! GO!</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Take it alive! Stoick grabs an axe and
charges into the arena. Astrid calls out to him, panicked.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Stoick no!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Dad! No! He won’t hurt you! The other
Vikings surround and attack Toothless. He tosses them aside like rag
dolls, his eyes focused on Stoick.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No, don’t! You’re only making it worse!
Stoick raises his hammer as he charges for Toothless. Toothless ducks
and pounces on him. They tumble end over end.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Toothless! STOP! He pins Stoick and inhales.
The familiar hiss of gas builds. Everyone braces…</p>
<p><strong>no!</strong>: Toothless swallows back the blast and turns to
Hiccup, not understanding.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Get him! The crowd rushes him, piling on,
and taking Toothless down. Astrid holds Hiccup back.</p>
<p>****: No! Please…just don’t hurt him. Please don’t hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Put it with the others! His burning glare
turn to Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>on hiccup</strong>: Being shoved into the dank, dimmed hall.
SLAM! The massive doors rattle and echo. Stoick pushes past him. He
paces against a backdrop of shadowy tapestries and carved pillars – a
legacy of heroes, all peering down in angered judgement.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: I should have known. I should have seen the
signs.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: We had a deal! Stoick pauses to say
something, but stops short. He SNORTS and resumes pacing, repeating the
cycle.</p>
<p>****: I know we did… but that was before… ughh, it’s all so messed
up.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: So everything in the ring. A trick? A lie?
He stomps toward Hiccup. Stops short and points, fighting back
words.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I screwed up. I should have told you before
now. Take this out on me, be mad at me, but please… just don’t hurt
Toothless.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: The dragon? That’s what you’re worried
about? Not the people you almost killed?!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: He was just protecting me! He’s not
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: They’ve killed HUNDREDS OF US!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: And we’ve killed THOUSANDS OF THEM! They
defend themselves, that’s all! They raid us because they have to! If
they don’t bring enough food back, they’ll be eaten themselves.</p>
<p>****: There’s something else on their island dad…it’s a dragon like–
Stoick HUFFS.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: –Their island? He stomps back… pointing an
accusing finger.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: So you’ve been to the nest.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Did I say nest? Hiccup goes silent – he said
too much.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: How did you find it?!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No… I didn’t. Toothless did. Only a dragon
can find the island. Stoick GLARES. A moment passes, then an idea takes
form on his face. His eyes flare. Hiccup watches, realizing. Stoick
stomps toward the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh no. No, Dad. No. Hiccup chases after him,
panicked.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Dad. It’s not what you think. You don’t know
what you’re up against. It’s like nothing you’ve ever seen. He grabs
Stoick by the arm, tugging with all his might. He has no effect
whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Dad. Please. I promise you that you can’t
win this one. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No. Dad. No. For once in your life,</p>
<p><strong>me?!</strong>: He throws Hiccup off of him, SWATTING him to
the floor. Icy stillness. Hiccup stares back, stunned.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: You’ve thrown your lot in with them. You’re
not a Viking.</p>
<p>****: You’re not my son. Stoick pushes through the door, leaving
Hiccup alone, devastated.</p>
<p>****: Ready the ships!</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Set sail! We head for Helheim’s Gate. He
then notices HICCUP watching from his familiar cliff-side perch beyond
the village. Their eyes meet, full of hurt and regret. Hiccup slowly
shakes his head in warning. Stoick breaks the stare and turns to
Toothless, fuming.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Lead us home, Devil.</p>
<p><strong>on hiccup</strong>: Watching. He’s powerless to stop what is
happening, but won’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>on hiccup</strong>: Still standing there. The ships have
cleared the horizon. CRANE UP to reveal Astrid is standing behind him.
She approaches cautiously and stands beside him in silence.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: It’s a mess. Hiccup doesn’t respond.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: You must feel horrible. You’ve lost
everything. Your father, your tribe, your best friend.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Thank you for summing that up.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Why couldn’t I have killed that dragon when
I found him in the woods. It would have been better for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Yep. The rest of us would have done it.</p>
<p>****: So why didn’t you? Hiccup just shakes his head - he really
doesn’t know. Astrid’s eyes glimmer. She wants something.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Why didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I don’t know. I couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: That’s not an answer.</p>
<p>****: Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Because I want to remember what you say
right now.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Oh for the love of – I was a coward! I was
weak. I wouldn’t kill a dragon.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: You said ‘wouldn’t’ that time.</p>
<p>****: Whatever! I wouldn’t! Three hundred years and I’m the first
Viking who wouldn’t kill a dragon!</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: First to ride one, though. Hiccup blinks. He
never looked at it that way before.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: So…</p>
<p>****: …I wouldn’t kill him because he looked as frightened as I
was.</p>
<p>****: I looked at him and I saw myself. Astrid turns to face the open
sea.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: I bet he’s really frightened now.</p>
<p>****: What are you going to do about it? Beat.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Probably something stupid.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Good. But you’ve already done that. Another
beat.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Then something crazy. Astrid smiles.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: That’s more like it.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Sound your positions. Stay within earshot.
Shouts pour in from all directions.</p>
<p><strong>viking #1</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>viking #2</strong>: One length to your stern.</p>
<p><strong>viking #3</strong>: On your starboard flank.</p>
<p><strong>viking #4</strong>: Three widths to port.</p>
<p><strong>viking #5</strong>: Ahead, at your bow.</p>
<p><strong>viking #6</strong>: Haven’t a clue. ON STOICK straining into
the fog as the calls continue. Massive, jagged sea stacks begin to
emerge, threatening to rip the ships to shreds. Gobber approaches him,
speaking under his breath.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Listen… Stoick… I was overhearing some of
the men just now and, well, some of them are wondering what it is we’re
up to here – not me of course, I know you’re always the man with the
plan – but some, not me, are wondering if there is in fact a plan at
all, what it might be?</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Find the nest and take it.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Ah. Of course. Send them running. The old
Viking fall-back. Nice and simple.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Shhh. Stoick notices that Toothless’ ear
plates are at the alert, quietly reacting to inaudible sounds. Stoick
crosses to the stern of the ship and grabs the tiller, moving the
helmsman out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Step aside. Stoick pulls the ship into a
turn, covertly following Toothless’ head movements.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Bear to port. The order is called out from
ship to ship. CRUNCH! The bow barely makes it past another sea stack.
Stoick continues to follow Toothless’ cues, undeterred.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: If you’re planning on getting eaten, I’d
definitely go with the Gronckle. Hiccup turns to see his fellow
recruits, watching him with folded arms. Tuffnut steps forward with a
scowl.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: You were wise to seek help from the world’s
most deadly weapon.</p>
<p>****: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: I love this plan.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: You’re crazy.</p>
<p>****: I like that.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: So? What is the plan? Hiccup smiles, glowing
in the support of his friends.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Ah. I was wondering where that went. A
clicking buzz becomes audible, growing louder. It fills the sky,
converging in one general direction. Stoick sniffs the air.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Stay low and ready your weapons. Stoick’s
ship suddenly JERKS to a halt as the keel burrows into shallow black
sand. Stoick hops overboard, landing on a sprawling beach. The BUZZING
suddenly STOPS. Above him, a craggy volcano towers into the gloom.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: We’re here. Behind him, several
dragon-headed bows pierce the fog.</p>
<p>****: Uh-uh. Hiccup slows to a stop in front of the teens, with the
Nightmare inches from his outstretched hand. He reaches over and grabs
Snotlout’s trembling hand.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: Wait! What are you…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Relax. It’s okay… it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: Where are you going?! Hiccup pulls a
bundle of rope from a supply box.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: You’re going to need something to help you
hold on. The teens eye each other apprehensively, and look up to reveal…
ALL THE DRAGONS standing in the ring, facing the teens expectantly.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Tree trunks, being sharpened and planted
into the sand at angled rows. Boulders being loaded into catapult
baskets. And a war plan being scratched in the sand. STOICK looms over
it, looking determined. His generals are at his sides.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: When we crack this mountain open, all hell
is going to break loose.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: In my undies. Good thing I brought extras.
Stoick TURNS to face the men.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: No matter how this ends, it ends today. He
walks toward the base of the volcano wall, back by several hundred
warriors. He raises his arm and drops it.</p>
<p><strong>with dragons.</strong>: Stoick pulls his hammer and rushes
into the cave, brazen.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: In a chaotic flurry, the dragons suddenly
rush out like bats from a cave. The take to the air, bypassing the
axe-swinging Vikings and fleeing the island in a mass exodus. The
battle-ready Vikings drop their weapons, confused.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Is that it? Above the island, dragons POUR
from every crevice, fleeing to the sky. The sound of screeching dragons
fades.</p>
<p><strong>spitelout</strong>: We’ve done it! Stoick doesn’t celebrate.
Something is not right. He HEARS something. Stoick turns to peer down
the dark throat of the cavern. A deep, rumbling ROAR echoes from the
cavern. The ground underfoot TREMBLES. The ships rock. Their sails fill
with a blast of air. The cheering stops. Stoick’s expression sinks.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: This isn’t over. Form your ranks! Hold
together! The men SCRAMBLE to organize themselves.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Get clear!</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Beard of Thor…what is that?</p>
<p>****: Odin help us.</p>
<p>****: Catapults! The Vikings score direct hits. The burning stones
BOUNCE off the dragon’s skin. The Red Death focuses on the catapults. It
crushes the first one - smashing it and its crew, rattling the beach
underfoot. Stoick races toward the second catapult. He LEAPS and pushes
a Viking out of the way just before the dragon crushes him under his
forepaw. The Vikings scramble in all directions.</p>
<p><strong>viking #3</strong>: Get to the ships!</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: No! NO! The Red Death BLASTS the ships like
a mile-long flamethrower. The sails are torched. Vikings dive overboard
and masts come down. Gobber Joins Stoick.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Heh. Smart, that one. Stoick looks up and
down the beach for an answer.</p>
<p>****: I was a fool. The monster raises its head to the sky and
BELLOWS. The sound SHAKES the beach, knocking Vikings off their feet.
This island is his. Stoick stops a Viking General.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Lead the men to the far side of the
island.</p>
<p><strong>spitelout</strong>: Right. Everybody to the far side of the
island! The Vikings scatter into the rocks like ants. Satisfied with the
ships destruction, The Red Death turns its attention back to the
Vikings. They seem to have vanished. It SNIFFS the air, searching for
their scent. Gobber drops in beside Stoick, like two soldiers in a
trench. Fire blasts over head, causing them to duck.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Gobber, go with the men.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: I think I’ll stay, just in case you’re
thinking of doing something crazy. Stoick grabs him.</p>
<p>****: I can buy them a few minutes if I give that thing someone to
hunt. Gobber removes Stoick’s hand. Clenches his forearm,
determined.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Then I can double that time. Stoick grins.
Friends to the bitter end. They BREAK COVER and dash into the open,
SPLITTING UP. Stoick rips a sharpened post from the ground and hurls it
into the monster’s face.</p>
<p><strong>no, here!</strong>: It spots both of them. He fuels up to
fire, glancing back and forth between the two men. He focuses on
Stoick.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Come on! Fight me!</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: No, me! The Red Death remains focused on
Stoick - this is it. It rears back and inhales. Gas begins to amass,
when… KABLAM! A BLAST explodes against the back of The Red Death’s head.
It turns distracted, as… … a Nadder punches through the flames, banking
across the sky. Followed by a Monstrous Nightmare, a Zippleback, and a
Gronckle. They roll in unison, revealing the recruits riding on their
backs. Hiccup leads, with Astrid clinging to his waist. GOBBER AND
STOICK, watch slack-jawed, in awe.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Ruff, Tuff, watch your backs! Move Fishlegs!
The monster shakes off the blast and snaps in their wake. Hiccup directs
his squadron out of harm’s way. They climb out of reach and circle each
other.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Look at us, we’re on a dragon! We’re on
dragons, all of us!</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Up, let’s move it! The dragons climb past
the Red Death.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: Gobber hobbles over to Stoick.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Every bit the boar-headed, stubborn Viking
you ever were. Stoick is speechless.</p>
<p><strong>in the air</strong>: The group circles over the dragon’s
head.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Fishlegs, break it down.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Okay. Heavily armored skull and tail made
for bashing and crushing.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Steer clear of both. Small eyes, large
nostrils. Relies on hearing and smell.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay. Lout, Legs, hang in its blind spot.
Make some noise, keep it confused. Ruff, Tuff, find out if it has a shot
limit. Make it mad.</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: That’s my specialty.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Since when? Everyone knows I’m more
irritating. See.</p>
<p>****: Just do what I told you. I’ll be back as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Don’t worry, we got it covered!</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Yeah! Hiccup and Astrid peel away. The
teens bank and dive toward the monster, splitting up. The Twins race
alongside the monster’s head, taunting it.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Troll!</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: Butt Elf!</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: Bride of Grendel! The Red Death unloads a
spray of fire at the twins. They barely dodge it. Fishlegs and Snotlout
hang behind its eyes, banging away at their shields, making a racket.
The Red Death opens all SIX of its eyes, spotting them.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Uh, this thing doesn’t have a blind
spot.</p>
<p><strong>on hiccup and astrid</strong>: … searching for Toothless.
Hiccup spots him among the burning ships.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: There! He steers the Nadder over the deck
and hands Astrid the reins. He lines up his jump… and hops off, guarding
his face from the flames. He lands on the burning deck.</p>
<p>****: Go help the others! She and the Nadder take off. As Hiccup
fights his way to Toothless. He unbuckles the muzzle. Toothless
shrieks.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay, hold on. Hold on. He gets to work on
the chains.</p>
<p><strong>on snotlout and fishlegs</strong>: They clang their weapons
against their shields, making the monster wince.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: It’s working. The huge beast starts to
sway its head dizzily.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: Yeah! It’s working. PAN DOWN to reveal
that the noise is also confusing the Gronckle and the Monstrous
Nightmare. Both dragons lose their bearings. The Red Death thrashes,
knocking Snotlout off of his dragon and onto the monster’s gigantic
head. Snotlout bounces across the top and comes to a stop just shy of
the hundred foot drop.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: Agghh! Fishlegs’ Gronckle goes down in a
spin of confusion.</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: I’ve lost power on the Gronckle. Snotlout!
Do something! He hurls Snotlout his hammer. The Gronkle crashes and
skids to a stop…</p>
<p><strong>fishlegs</strong>: I’m okay! … then flips over, crushing
Fishlegs.</p>
<p>****: Less okay.</p>
<p><strong>back to snotlout</strong>: … who eyes the Red Death’s
gigantic, veiny eyes. He raises the hammer…</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: I can’t miss! … and hammers the monster’s
eyes, playing whack-a-mole.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: What’s wrong buddy, got something in your
eye? Astrid flies by on her Nadder, catching Snotlout in all his
heroics.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Yeah! You’re the Viking! Snotlout grins,
finally vindicated in her eyes. In his distraction, he gets thrown and
lands heavily on one of the Red Death’s spines – clinging precariously.
A close call.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: The monster’s tail sweeps across the
burning ships, snapping masts like twigs. We follow one down as it
crashes onto a deck, revealing…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Working at the chains. He can’t budge them.
Fire licks at his clothes. He looks up to see…</p>
<p><strong>underwater</strong>: Hiccup swims toward Toothless. They’re
both caught in a mess of rigging, being dragged down. The heavy palette
settles into the rocky bottom like an anchor. Toothless has stopped
struggling. Hiccup takes one more hopeless tug at the chains - he’s
almost out of air. Suddenly, a meaty hand grabs Hiccup. STOICK explodes
to the surface, pulling Hiccup to the shoreline through flaming debris.
He lays him down, under the shelter of an overhanging rock.</p>
<p>****: Dad… Stoick dives back into the water between flaming
flotsam.</p>
<p><strong>underwater</strong>: ON TOOTHLESS, drowning. Stoick appears
in front of him. Toothless freezes. Stoick tears the chains off of the
yoke and lets it float free. Momentary stillness. They eye each other,
through the churned up bubbles. Toothless lunges out of the bars –
grabbing Stoick. BOOM! In an explosion of sea water, Toothless lands on
the shore, setting Stoick down and releasing him. Hiccup is awed. The
ground rumbles underfoot. The monster screeches. Its massive claws stomp
around in the smoke. Stoick gives way as Toothless mounts the rock and
raises his wings. He turns to Hiccup and SNORTS - ‘Let’s go.’</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: You got it, bud. Hiccup climbs onto
Toothless and buckles himself in. Stoick grabs his arm.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Hiccup. I’m sorry…for everything.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Yeah…me too.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: You don’t have to go up there.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: We’re Vikings. It’s an occupational hazard.
They exchange smiles.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: I’m proud to call you my son. Hiccup beams,
taken aback.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Thanks dad. Stoick lets go of Hiccup’s arm.
Hiccup spurs Toothless on, charged with his father’s belief in him. They
rocket into the sky as Stoick watches.</p>
<p><strong>in the air</strong>: Astrid sees Toothless streaking through
the sky, gaining altitude.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: He’s up! She turns to Ruffnut and Tuffnut,
who are ARGUING and THROWING PUNCHES at each other.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: Get Snotlout out of there! IN MID-PUNCH, the
twins look over to see Snotlout stranded on the monster’s head. They eye
each other.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut ruffnut</strong>: I’m on it! I’m on it!</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: I’m on it first! I’m ahead of you. The
twins spot Snotlout on the giant dragon and steer their Zippleback in
his direction.</p>
<p><strong>ruffnut</strong>: Hey! Let me drive! The twins peel off,
ARGUING as they race each other to the monster. Snotlout sees the
Zippleback diving toward him and DASHES down the Red Death’s head. He
runs up the end of its horn… As the twins sweep past, both missing him…
but perfectly snatching him where the necks merge. Ruff and Tuff eye
each other, surprised and impressed.</p>
<p><strong>tuffnut</strong>: I can’t believe that worked. The Red Death
spots Astrid and INHALES, preparing to blast. She and her Nadder get
caught in the suction, pulled toward the monster’s gaping mouth.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: The Vikings watch with dread. They
hear the familiar whir of the…</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Night Fury! Get down!</p>
<p><strong>in the air</strong>: A massive BLAST jolts the Red Death’s
head sideways. Astrid is thrown clear of its mouth… AND her Nadder. She
tumbles through the air. The ground races toward her, when… She’s
suddenly CAUGHT by the leg. She looks up to see Toothless.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Did you get her? Toothless grunts.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: They fly over the crowd of Vikings
and set Astrid down, mid- run. They circle back to reengage - a black
speck against the clouds.</p>
<p>****: Go.</p>
<p>****: That thing has wings! Okay, let’s see if it can use them!
Hiccup pulls Toothless into a turn. They plummet, gaining tremendous
speed. The wind buffets them as they target the Red Death as super sonic
speed. KABLAM! Toothless unloads a fireball against the Red Death’s
head. It goes down with a rumble as they climb anew.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: The Vikings shield themselves from
the dust of the fallen monster… as its wings unfold and extend.</p>
<p><strong>in the air</strong>: Hiccup looks back as they put distance
between them.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Do you think that did it? Suddenly, the
enraged behemoth RISES into frame… flapping its wings furiously. A
daunting sight.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Well, he can fly. Hiccup and Toothless DIVE
into the tangled sea stacks - they weave through the rock like rabbits
through a briar. The Red Death SNAPS at them, but cannot reach them.
Hiccup and Toothless PULL AHEAD. The Red Death SMASHES through the
canopy of rock and pulls in behind Toothless. He BURSTS THROUGH
fifty-foot formations like they were saplings.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: Stoick, Gobber, and the Teens watch
as Hiccup and Toothless streak past, weaving through sea stacks.</p>
<p><strong>teens</strong>: Woohoo! Yeah! A moment later the Red Death
SMASHES the sea stacks to dust in hot pursuit. The Vikings mood is
quenched.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay Toothless, time to disappear. Toothless
PULLS into a steep climb, heading toward the clouds.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Come on bud! The Red Death follows, closing
in fast.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Here it comes! BLAST! They narrowly dodge a
column of flame and smoke. They reach the low-hanging clouds and pierce
them. The monster follows, immediately losing them in the hampered
visibility. It roars irritably. From out of nowhere, Toothless DIVES at
the huge dragon, BLASTING and PUNCTURING a hole in its wing. Toothless
and Hiccup are gone again before the dragon can get a shot at them.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: The Vikings stare up at the sky
listening to the resounding BOOMS and watching FLASHES light up the
clouds. Gobber places a hand on Stoick’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>in the air</strong>: HICCUP and TOOTHLESS dive in again and
again, using the clouds to hide and surprise as they puncture the
monster’s wings. It BELLOWS in frustration and WHIRLS around, unleashing
fire blindly, in all directions. Hiccup sees the glow of fire cutting
towards them.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Watch out! The random blast CLIPS Toothless’
tail. It’s heavily damaged.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay, time’s up. Let’s see if this works. He
pulls Toothless into a turn. They fly directly into the Red Death’s
face, taunting it.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Come on! Is that the best you can do!?
Toothless utters an insult too, and they jackknife into a steep dive.
The Red Death pursues. Toothless PUMPS his wings, racing faster than
he’s ever gone before. Hiccup and Toothless stay just ahead of the Red
Death – no longer trying to evade it. Hiccup glances back to check the
tail - it’s disintegrating.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Stay with me buddy. We’re good. Just a
little bit longer. The Red Death closes the gap. Hiccup tucks in and
holds Toothless steady – allowing the monster to set its sights on them.
It narrows its eyes.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Hold, Toothless. The Red Death OPENS his
mouth. The familiar gas HISS emanates from his throat – ignition is
coming.</p>
<p><strong>now!</strong>: Hiccup HITS the PEDALS HARD as Toothless
extends one wing. They PIVOT in place, hurtling directly into the Red
Death’s mouth. Toothless FIRES point blank down the monster’s throat.
Its amassing gas is ignited, BACKFIRING into the monster, erupting in a
chain of blasts throughout its body. Hiccup and Toothless BURST from the
clouds, the Red Death hot on their tail, exploding from within. It
glances forward and sees the ground rushing up. It throws open its
wings, attempting to put on the brakes, but the punctured, damaged wings
can’t stop its momentum. As the Red Death chokes on the expanding
fireball, he sees Toothless suddenly pull out of the dive, streaking up,
past its head.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: No. No. Hiccup and Toothless can’t maneuver
- they’re dead in the air. The giant club tail CLIPS Toothless, TEARING
Hiccup from the harness and sending him tumbling against the backdrop of
the fast-approaching fireball. Toothless STRUGGLES with all his might to
reach the unconscious Hiccup. But the fireball swallows them both.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground</strong>: The Vikings watch in horror as Hiccup
and Toothless disappear into the boiling inferno.</p>
<p><strong>dissolve to:</strong>: A whiteout of ash. And through it
comes…</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Hiccup? Hiccup!? Stoick appears, searching
desperately. Everything is scorched. Even the ground is smoking from the
terrible heat.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Hiccup!? Son!? Through the ash, Stoick the
motionless silhouette of Toothless.</p>
<p>****: Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Oh son…I did this… Astrid pushes through the
crowd, her eyes welling up. Followed by Gobber. They flank Stoick as he
kneels, slumped over. Behind them, a ring of Vikings form, keeping a
respectful distance. As the dust and smoke clear, a ring of wild dragons
can also be seen, gathering just behind and between the Vikings.
Toothless stirs and groggily rolls his head toward Stoick. Their eyes
meet.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: I’m so sorry… Toothless unfolds his wings,
revealing Hiccup, unconscious, clutched safely against his chest.
Stoick’s eyes widen.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: Hiccup. He scoops Hiccup into his arms.
Listens to his heart. Bursts into relieved laughter.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: He’s alive!</p>
<p>****: You brought him back alive! The crowd roars. Followed by the
dragons. The Vikings look around to find themselves surrounded. Stoick
leans close to Toothless, meeting him eye to eye.</p>
<p>****: Thank you… for saving my son. Gobber looks Hiccup up and
down.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Well, you know… most of him. Stoick glances
back at him. Gobber shrugs, redirecting his eyes toward…</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: HICCUP, asleep, his head on a pillow.
Healing scars on his face show that maybe a week or two have passed.
Toothless hovers over him, WHINING and GRUMBLING impatiently. Hiccup
stirs. Opens his eyes.</p>
<p>****: Oh, hey Toothless. Toothless excitedly nuzzles and nudges
Hiccup.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay, okay! I’m happy to see you too, bud.
Now just– Toothless steps on his groin, causing Hiccup to sit BOLT
UPRIGHT with a YELP. He looks around, confounded. He’s in his bed, moved
beside the fire pit on the main floor of his house.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I’m in my house. You’re in my house.
Toothless TEARS around the room, knocking things over, far too big for
the space.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Uh…does my dad know you’re in here?!
Toothless pauses at the foot of the bed, tongue wagging. He eyes the
rafters… and LEAPS UP onto them, brimming with ‘happy dog’ energy.</p>
<p>****: Okay, okay – no Toothless! Aw, come on… Hiccup shifts to get
out of bed… then pauses… sensing that something is wrong. He peels back
the covers slowly. What he sees startles, horrifies, and overwhelms him
– all at once.</p>
<p><strong>on the bare floor</strong>: His booted foot touches down.
Followed by a mechanical prosthetic in place of his second leg. It’s an
ingenious spring-loaded replacement, made of wood and iron. Toothless
lands by the bed and approaches calmly, sniffing the new leg. He raises
his eyes to meet Hiccup’s, seemingly aware of what Hiccup is going
through. Hiccup braces himself on the bedpost and tries to stand on it.
He winces and stifles the pain…</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Okay…okay… … but STUMBLES with the first
step. Toothless catches Hiccup’s fall with his head… and slowly lifts
him up, stabilizing him.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Thanks bud. Hiccup leans on him like a
crutch. They take a few steps together. Their missing parts form a
poetic silhouette as they make their way toward the door. Hiccup pries
it open , revealing a MONSTROUS NIGHTMARE flapping outside the door.
Hiccup YELPS and slams the door closed. He turns to Toothless,
alarmed.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Toothless? Stay here, bud. Hiccup pauses…
and cracks the door open again. He peeks outside, his eyes widening. He
allows to door to swing open, revealing… … the Monstrous Nightmare,
carrying Snotlout on its back.</p>
<p><strong>snotlout</strong>: Come on guys, get ready! Hold on tight!
Here we go! A class of newbie dragon riders follow him through frame on
a variety of dragons, pulling back the curtain on an amazing vista in
which:</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: I knew it. I’m dead. Stoick laughs.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: No, but you gave it your best shot. He puts
his arm around Hiccup, steadying him. He gestures to the transformed
village.</p>
<p><strong>stoick</strong>: So? What do you think? Hiccup just shrugs,
amazed. Below, the plaza, villagers take notice.</p>
<p><strong>viking #1</strong>: Hey look! It’s Hiccup! They rush over,
surrounding him with a hero’s welcome.</p>
<p><strong>viking #2</strong>: Hiccup, how you doin’ mate?</p>
<p><strong>viking #3</strong>: It’s great to see you up and about.</p>
<p>****: Turns out all we needed was a little more of…</p>
<p>****: … this.</p>
<p>****: You just gestured to all of me.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Well. Most of you. Gobber pushes through the
crowd, beaming proudly.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: That bit’s my handiwork. With a little
Hiccup flare thrown in. Think it’ll do?</p>
<p>****: I might make a few tweaks. Astrid appears and jabs Hiccup in
the arm. Hiccup recoils with a grumble.</p>
<p><strong>astrid</strong>: That’s for scaring me.</p>
<p>****: What, is it always going to be this way? Cause I… She grabs him
aggressively… then kisses him. Hoots and hollers follow.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: … could get used to it. Gobber presents
Hiccup with a rebuilt saddle, rigging, and tail.</p>
<p><strong>gobber</strong>: Welcome home. Suddenly, Toothless pounces on
the crowd, crushing several unsuspecting Vikings under his weight.</p>
<p><strong>viking</strong>: Night Fury, get down! Toothless eyes the new
tail excitedly, tongue wagging. Amidst the groans and grumbles, Hiccup
and Astrid exchange a sheepish grin.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: Hiccup’s prosthetic foot, snapping into
the modified stirrup.</p>
<p><strong>cut back to reveal…</strong>: Hiccup and Toothless, saddled
up and ready to fly. Astrid backs her Nadder into position.</p>
<p>****: You ready? Toothless SNORTS an excited ‘yes!’ From his mount,
Hiccup looks out over the changed world.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: This… is Berk.</p>
<p>****: It snows nine months of the year… and hails the other three.
They LEAP into the bright blue sky, together as one. Astrid follows,
giving chase.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: Any food that grows here is tough and
tasteless. The people that grow here are even more so. Hiccup and Astrid
race their dragons through the village – under eaves, over rooftops,
down cliff-sides, and between ship masts. It’s a high energy, romantic
dance of sorts.</p>
<p><strong>hiccup</strong>: The only upsides are the pets. While other
places have…ponies or parrots, we have… Their fellow recruits join them
as they take to the open sky, rocketing far above the village. The
Northern sky swirls with blazing, multicolored dragons. Hiccup and
Toothless break from the pack, spinning into the blinding sun.</p>
<p>****: … dragons.</p>
