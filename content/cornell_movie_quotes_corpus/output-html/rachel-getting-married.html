<p><strong>walter</strong>: I want my fucking Zippo now!</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Walter, that is a behavior…</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: And you are making a choice.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Hold on…Hello?</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: God!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Don’t you get it yet, Waldo? She’s making a
choice not to give you your lighter because you’ll torch the Self-Help
library again.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: I’m Walter. Kill anybody recently? Run
anybody over with a fucking car?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: That them?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Yes. Finally.</p>
<p><strong>walter</strong>: You’re not letting her get behind the wheel
are you? Are you?</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Walter, you are only responsible for yourself.
This is all your stuff?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You know you never gave me your cell
number.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: It was a mistake. I’m lucky I didn’t get
fired. We’ve discussed this. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oh my god. Here you are. I thought you were
going to abandon me in rehab. It’s 12:30. You guys are half an hour
late. I’ve been standing here with these lunatics. You look so
great.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello. I’m Paul Buchman.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: I’m Rosa. We met last time you came up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Of course, of course.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Let’s go, let’s go. Where is everybody?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Hey Carol. How are ya?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Hello Kym.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: So where’s Rachel? Carol, where’s Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Getting everything ready at the house.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: There is so much going on at the house I can’t
tell you. You know your sister’s doing all of it herself.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: mirror as she arranges</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No wedding planners or anything like that.
Just her and Sidney and a lot of their friends. She is so thrilled
you’re here. Is that everything, sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Yah. Can we go?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Is there anyone you want to say goodbye
to?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: God no.</p>
<p><strong>2 ext./int. transitional shots. day 2</strong>: The station
wagon travels through a constantly changing series of environments as
they journey out of New York City on their drive to suburban
Connecticut.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: So are all these busy young wedding helpers
staying at the house? Because after eight months of constantly revolving
cell mates and crazy people…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You weren’t in a cell, Kym…</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: …AND groups groups GROUPS…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …And nobody was crazy, nobody was in a rubber
room…</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: …I was looking forward to a little privacy for
once.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: The only extra person staying at the house is
Emma, who’s actually been staying in your old room. But she can move, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Rachel and Emma. Oh, great. How relaxing.</p>
<p><strong>2 continued: 2</strong>: KYM</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Nachtmare?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It’s a nightmare so bad it’s in German.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Rachel must be totally freaking out. Is she too
tense?…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s a wigwam!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: rifling through her bag</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t think that that’s a problem for
her.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: No offense, Dad, but you never thought that was
a problem for her. I’m kidding. It’ll be great to see her. Foodies are
the worst, though. They never get it together. There were six of them on
my floor in the hospital and you could never get into the bathroom. They
would cry at the chocolate pudding and one of</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’ll see her and Andrew at the rehearsal
dinner tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Can we stop at the 7/11 please? I feel
nauseous. I need something to drink.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I brought you a Diet Coke.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I prefer Pepsi from the fountain.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. mini-mart. day. 4</strong>: Kym fills her Big Gulp at
the fountain and pays at the counter. The COUNTER GIRL gives her
change.</p>
<p><strong>counter girl</strong>: I saw you on COPS.</p>
<p><strong>6 ext. the buchman house. day. 6</strong>: The station wagon
pulls into a CIRCULAR DRIVEWAY lined with trees and bushes of beautiful
blue hydrangea. There are several late model cars parked in the driveway
of the SPRAWLING, SHINGLED HOUSE. Young people crawling everywhere in
the midst of WEDDING PREPARATION, wrapping garlands and hanging paper
lanterns. A LITTLE GIRL tosses rose petals in the swimming pool. The
atmosphere is slightly punch drunk and friendly.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I’ll do it, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>rachel’s voice off</strong>: Can we raise this hem half an
inch?</p>
<p><strong>emma’s voice off</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Here, let me just…</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oh my god, you are just mi-nute!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kymmie!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: You can’t smoke in here–</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I have pins all over me. You look great!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I’m fat. Rehab makes you fat. All the vending
machines. Look at you, missy! I’d swear to god you were puking
again!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hah!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Kym!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Emma! No seriously, you’re so tiny it’s like
you’re Asian. Dad wants us to sleep in the same room so you’ll be able
to watch me while he’s asleep and I won’t sneak out of the house and
blow dealers and shoot heroin.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dad did not say “blow dealers.”</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I told him I’d just sleep in Ethan’s room.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You can always shoot up in the tree
house.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Kym, I’m not remotely surprised you’re
starting your drama already, however it’s Rachel’s wedding and this week
it’s about her.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Emma, you still have your tiny core of rage!
What a relief.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: So are you an actual shrink yet? Even though
you’re like twelve years old?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Psychology. Not psychiatry. You know the
difference, right?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You should prescribe something soothing for
Emma. Like Vicodin.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I will have my PhD. in a year and a half.
And psychologists don’t get prescription pads, right Kym?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: They do in Guam.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Would you please put that out? Emma designed
this dress and there’s forty-seven yards of it and I’ll go up like the
Hindenburg.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Since when are you a designer, Emma?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: A while.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She has this great little boutique in
Greenwich. She says things like “you need a fabulous jersey pant.”</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: That’s so great. I think I heard that. Isn’t
this your fifth incarnation or something? Weren’t you an actress? All
the N.E.D.’s in the hospital were actresses…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: N.E.D.s?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Non-specified Eating Disorder.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: …they were constantly doing leg lifts under the
sheets.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Angela Paylin is coming to the wedding.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I ate so much cookie dough and did so many
whip-its with Angela Paylin.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know. And she confessed to you her secret
Elvis Stoyko fantasy. I spied on you.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oh my god…</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Elvis Stoyko the figure skater?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: In her fantasy, she was wearing her hair up
and very serious, responsible eyeglasses, because she was a world
renowned judge at the Winter Olympics for Men’s Figure Skating. And
Elvis Stoyko was skating in the finals to “Could It Be Magic” for the
gold medal. And just when Barry Manilow is singing “Now/ Now/ Now and
hold on fast…” there’s this electric connection between them and he
stops in the middle of his triple lutz…axel…</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: And he skates over to the judges table, all
panting and sweaty, with his spangly Neil Diamond shirt open to the
chest…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: There is silence as he stops in front of
her, their eyes lock, and he reaches for her hand… and Angela takes
it!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: To the roar of the crowd and the shock of the
Olympic judges!</p>
<p><strong>8 continued: 8</strong>: KYM</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And he gets disqualified but he doesn’t
care!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Where’d she get the skates from?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I should call her right this second. Is she
really coming? Who are all these energetic young people decorating the
house?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: She’s got everyone she knows pulling elf
duty.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: What about me? What am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, I think you’ll be assisting on floral
detail. I want everything all drippy and luxurious and Mom’s a little
bit tasteful–</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: –Mom’s in charge of flowers?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: –and I don’t want to upset her.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: And you’re such a diplomat.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I am. I’m like Kofi Annan. In rehab they said I
was the maternal hub of my peer group. I was always the referee for
softball.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I was. I was the only one who could convince
the methamphetamine freaks that no one was chasing them when they ran
around the bases.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It’s softball. Someone was chasing them.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Whatever. They have trust issues in the first
place. I’m going downstairs to find Olive and get some unconditional
love.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Anyway, I’m doing some lighting. I already got
the candles and everything.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Forget Mom and me and the fucking flowers.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Speaking of dawgs, when am I going to meet this
fiancee of yours anyway?</p>
<p><strong>rachel voice off</strong>: He went to get stuff with Kieran.
They’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>11 int. upstairs hallway. day. 11</strong>: Kym wandering the
upstairs hallway…the winding corridors are a little spooky, despite the
openness and light, it feels haunted up here…looking into her old
bedroom, seeing Emma’s stuff inside.</p>
<p><strong>12 int. upstairs hallway. day. –looking down– 12</strong>:
Paul comes to the bottom of the stairs, yelling up.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’m making hot dogs and hungabungas! Who wants
what?!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s too hot!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I don’t eat gluten, Paul!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What don’t you eat?!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Gluten!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where’s Kym?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Besides I’m in my dress!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Ooo! Can I see?!</p>
<p><strong>rachel/emma</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay, okay!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kymmie, what can I make you?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Actually there’s a meeting I have to make. And
I have to pee in a cup. And register as a general biohazard.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I’ll drive you.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Just tell me which car I should take.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Which car?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Would you do me a favor, Kymmie…?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I have a license…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You wouldn’t believe my insurance. And I’m
not… that comfortable. Could we figure something else out?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Hi. I’m here to pee in a cup.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: She needs to pee in a cup. Someone will be
right with you.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Okay. I’m trying to get to a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The meetings are over in the other
building.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I know that.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Someone will be right with you. Have a
seat.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Piss!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>attractive guy</strong>: Only once. My dealer. I was really
broke.</p>
<p><strong>attractive guy</strong>: Let’s see…that was Tuesday…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Carol, she’s here!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Where did you think I was?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I made you a sandwich, sweetheart!
Meatloaf!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kymberly!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No. You guys are not getting my design
concept.</p>
<p><strong>22 continued: 22</strong>: RACHEL</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Oh. I thought you said Satan Claus.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: I thought she said Panty Hose. Or Panda
Claws.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Pandas are endangered.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know. We’re having an endangered Panda
fleeing for its life for the ice sculpture. Or impaling itself on some
bamboo. Kym! This is Sidney Williams, my betrothed. Sidney, meet my
sister, Kym.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oh my god. You’re black. Sorry I called him a
dawg.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: No biggie.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You don’t look like a record producer. You’re
supposed to have a hapless lackey next to you with an umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Usually I do, but Mom’s out simonizing my
car. Funny, you don’t look like Lucifer’s Cupbearer.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I got a haircut.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And this is Best Man Kieran.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Well, that was so wrong –</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Gee, thanks!</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: No, believe me, that was so lovely, LOVELY!
But in the program – as you know – and we just heard earlier today in
fact –</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: It is kind of lurid, isn’t it? The best man and
the maid of honor… furtively slipping off to the coal bin to have it off
while the rest of the wedding party labors away at preparations for the
big event.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: I thought…isn’t Emma going to be playing
that role?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: “Maid of Honor”?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: I think I heard that was the plan.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Isn’t the lilac fabulous? You look like a
freesia.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I love the grey.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: We’re all wearing lilac.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Look at this. I love this. It’s like a
cloud.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You guys know how I am. I never wear lilac.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It’s good to have a principle.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You wore a lilac sweater with a cat face on
it on the cover of Seventeen Magazine when I was at Fat Camp.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Sure, but I got paid for that and I was on
horse tranquilizers. So why aren’t I the Maid of Honor? Why is Emma the
Maid of Honor?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Because.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I wasn’t entirely sure when you were coming
or even if you’d make it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I wasn’t sure if you’d have time for a
fitting.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Bullshit. It’s a sari. You take a bolt of cloth
and wrap it around you. Jesus Christ I’ve been home one day and I can’t
get a straight answer out of anybody.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I’m talking about Dad offering me food every
ten seconds…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dad offers Irish Hunger Strikers food every
ten seconds.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: No. He has to know where I am and what I’m
doing all the time because he has never resolved his own trust
issues.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: That’s odd.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Blow me.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh, leave Dad alone.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I’d love to but he won’t let me. I feel him
watching me all the time. And Carol and you guys too.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I know I have nothing better to think
about.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Everybody’s looking at me like I’m the visiting
sociopath. What are you people waiting for me to do? Burn the house
down?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: That was a mattress fire and it wasn’t even at
home! It was on a sleep over! God! I should just get HAZMAT tattooed on
my forehead for you people.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Stop! You’re like a harpy. Is being my “Maid
of Honor” this important to you? I didn’t think you gave a shit.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: How could you fucking say that to me?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Jesus. Emma!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Emma, would you be horribly offended and
hurt if I asked you to step down as… …“Maid of Honor?”</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Now Emma’s got another reason to hate me. Like
she needed one.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Is it what you want?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Fine. The crown is yours, First Runner Up.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Thank you, Emma. No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: It’s not about you.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: It’s about sisterhood.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Hooray for sisterhood.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Sisterhood conquers all.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And bludgeons all and pillages all and
leaves all for dead.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: So the gray is not an option?</p>
<p><strong>25 int. ukrainian museum. night. 25</strong>: THE REHEARSAL
DINNER –“The rehearsal” component is in full swing amidst elegant
dioramas and displays of Ukrainian folk art saints, traditional
costumes, a skillion painted eggs, the mounted heads of indigenous
Ukrainian animals, and the plaster busts of Ukrainian Popes.</p>
<p><strong>26 int. ukrainian museum dining hall. night. 26</strong>: THE
DINNER– The forty-odd guests are now seated in an adjoining room at LONG
TABLES laden with a GORGEOUS INDIAN FEAST. Yellow rice, red curry, vivid
green and orange vegetable dishes, pink shrimp. Huge plates of Dosa and
Brinjal. Candles flicker in lanterns shaped like lotuses. PHOTOGENICALLY
STYLISH YOUNG SERVERS dressed elegantly in black and white hover around
the family and friends as everybody makes total pigs of themselves. The
INDIAN FEAST contrasts agreeably with the Ukrainian visuals. EVOCATIVE
BOLLYWOOD MUSIC PROVIDES THE SOUNDTRACK. Kym, wandering on along the
table like a nomad, wedges herself between Sidney and Rachel. Emma grabs
an empty wine glass before Kym knocks it over.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I don’t know anybody at what’s obviously the
loser end of the table. Can I have your Chana Masala?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’ve known most of those people since the
eighth grade. You always pretend you don’t know people.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Is it because you owe them money?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Where’s Mom? Where’s our mother? How could she
not be here already? I haven’t even seen her since I’ve been home.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: She called a few times. She’s “running a
little late but should be here soon.”</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Kieran would you like some more Saag
Paneer?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: No thanks. Is there any krill?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I can’t believe Mom would be late for my
release back into the wild.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: And here I was thinking tonight was about
Rachel!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Rach, I forgot to tell you, Carol got the
helium tanks.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: The words “Carol” and “helium” somehow…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Aren’t there some rules about helium
tanks?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: She wouldn’t have any idea what to do with a
helium tank.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Only on public property. I think.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Huge liability.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You’re a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Was. For about five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Say something legal.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Tort.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: So what do you do now?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: I help Sidney out with the business side of
his stuff.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Sweet.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Here’s Mom.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Hello, darling.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Kym! Did you get my note?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I’m fat. Rehab makes you fat.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Nonsense. You girls.</p>
<p><strong>andrew</strong>: Hiya Kym. You look great! Hey Rachel!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Mom, where have you been? Is everything
okay?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Wow. We were wondering if you got the dates
scrambled.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Yes, everything is absolutely fine now.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Thank god. What a relief! Now the party can
really get started.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: So Mom, you look great.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Darling, can you smoke that in here?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: It’s a private party, Mom. How’s grandma? Still
surly and irascible?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Oh, you know how she is. She sends her
love.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Great. Same.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Honey, you should really put that out. It’s
not right. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>27 int. ukrainian museum dining hall. night. later.
27</strong>: Kieran is making a toast. Dinner is mostly over. Waiters
are discreetly clearing plates, etc. from the table, pouring more
drinks.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: I’ve known Sidney most of my life. He
personifies many of life’s grandest cliches, even as he breathes fresh
life into most of them. He has never, ever “ceased to amaze me,” and
only in the best of ways. The magnitude of his artistry and his business
acumen are matters of public record and delight. He’s been a great
friend “through thick and thin,” and sometimes it’s gotten very, very
thin – but he “stood by me” at all times, so it is my privilege and
honor to stand by him on this profound occasion…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re paying for that, Emma.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Of course. I’d like to make a toast to the
happy couple because I want to come visit them in Hawaii.</p>
<p><strong>27 continued: 27</strong>: EMMA</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Humuu-humuu Nukku-nukuu…</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: A-Pu-Aa-Aa.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You’re moving to Hawaii?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Sidney’s recording studio is there.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’ve known the bride her entire life. Not
biblically, except for that one time we french kissed at Evan Yassky’s
party in the ninth grade.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Film! I want film!</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Commence embarrassing story.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Rach, do you remember the time I was teaching
you to drive in the Wagoneer and you sideswiped that taxi driver and
knocked off his side mirror?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I have no memory of that whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Do you remember trying to outrun him and
leading him on a high speed chase across 96th street?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Gotta say no.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Well I would like to share with everyone that
Miss Rachel-before she got her license or even had any idea how to
drive- out maneuvered an irate, screaming cab driver across 96th street
to the East river, handily avoiding two EMT guys loading an old lady on
a gurney, while at the same time, applying Cocofudge Lip Gloss in the
rearview mirror.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Wait, wait. She actually got the number of one
of the E.M.T guys and went out with him. Twice.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Was that the guy with the peroxide hair?</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Anyway, when the taxi driver finally caught up
with us, Rachel talked him down from his Middle Eastern fury in pretend
Farsi, and ended up using his radio thing to call his dispatcher and
recommend this guy for a commendation.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Mahamoud! Such a nice man.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: We were driving so fast! It was one of the
more exhilarating moments in my life…sadly…but I knew that Miss Rachel
would make it okay. So here’s to you, my dear, dear friend. A woman who
can drive fast, pick up a paramedic, make up languages and get you home
in one piece. Sidney, you are a lucky bastard.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Hear hear.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where? Where?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Relax, it’s seltzer.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Hello. I’m Shiva the destroyer and your
harbinger of doom for the evening. I want to thank you all for coming
and welcome you even though I haven’t seen most of you since my latest
stretch in the Big House…</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You all look fabulous. During the twenty
minutes I was not in the hole for making a shiv out of my toothbrush, I
actually did participate in the infamous 12 Step program. 12 Steps.
Step-ball- change, step-ball-change. I’m still waiting for the change
part.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: But as they say, relapse is an almost always
inevitable component of recovery, God knows I’ve got high marks in that
mode!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Anyhoo, as more of you know than are likely to
admit, one of the actual steps is about making amends.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: So I spent a lot of time calling up people who
barely remembered me - who barely remembered anything - and apologizing
to them for bouncing a check or passing out in the bathtub and flooding
their house, or otherwise involving them in sordid activities they were
desperately trying to forget. I had to call this one girl who was, I
think, fourteen, but I couldn’t talk to her because her Mom took out a
restraining order.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Anyway, I did a lot of apologizing to people
who were practically strangers so I very much want to take this
opportunity to not only congratulate my extraordinary sister, the future
explorer in matters of the mind, thank you very much, and her adorable,
impending husband on the occasion of their unprecedented nuptials.. but
also to apologize to my extraordinary sister, the future explorer in
matters of the mind, for… Everything! And I really mean that, Rachel.
I’ve been a nightmare and you’ve been a saint. I’m so damned glad I’m
here with you and Sidney and his family and ours, and I am so happy for
you guys, I really am. So, I am hereby raising my seltzer in celebration
of my laudatory sister and herewith making amends. Sidney, you are
robbing our dysfunctional family of one of it’s most vital ingredients,
and it’s only member still willing to lend me money. Enjoy Hawaii. La
Chaim.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: One down. What’s for dessert?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I’m exhausted. Is there any watermelon?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Nice apology.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Nice apology.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I was toasting you and I was making amends.
It’s one of the Steps. It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know what the Steps are.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I learned them in school, and I’ve visited
you in various facilities, Kym.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oh, god. Dad?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Amends. Noun. Often followed by ‘for’.
Offset a disability or frustration by development in another
direction.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’ve never said anything to me, that’s
remotely apologetic. Yet, all of a sudden, at my wedding dinner, in
front of everybody, you decide to grace us all with your
development?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Christ. I just got here.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Here. Anybody else?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: “Hey everybody! And guests! Just in case you
might be thinking about something else for five minutes, like, I don’t
know, my sister’s wedding– they just cut me loose!</p>
<p><strong>30 continued: 30</strong>: RACHEL</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You’re so cynical. Dad, since when has she been
this cynical?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s making an effort, Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: An effort. That’s what it was? Because I
think she presumes that since everything has always revolved around her
disease, everything else is going to revolve around her recovery. That’s
what I think.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Rachel. She just got home.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Again.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I had no idea you were so angry, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kymmie, your sister’s got a lot on her plate.
She’s uptight about…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m not uptight, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She’s meeting Sidney’s folks for the first
time, there’s menus, there’s all that live music, you’re home, there’s a
thousand things to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Absolutely, a wedding will take it right out
of you, boy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yeah, it would be so lovely if we could all
just…</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You people need to purge. You people really
should go to Nar-Anon or something. I mean it.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh my lord. Kym, we have gone through
Nar-Anon, baby. You know that.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You people? You mean the people in this
room? Your family?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: All of you people living in this little world
of judgement and paranoia and mistrust. I can feel it every second. At
the slightest sign of ingratitude or absence of atonement it’s like the
freaking Salem Witch Trials around here. I might as well be…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t even start…</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Nobody can make you feel any way unless you
let them, Kym.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Thank you Carol, for your inevitable pearl of
wisdom, but you people are my family. You people make me feel like shit
a hundred times a day. You try living under Dad’s constant monitoring
for five minutes and see how you like it.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What constant monitoring?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: “I’ll drive you!” “Carol, she’s back!” “Don’t
sleep here, sleep there.” “Here. Eat this.” Dad, you’re obsessed.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Please. That’s hardly news. You may not know
this…sure you do…the only way to engage Dad in any meaningful
communication is to start the conversation with your name. “Have you
heard from Kym? How’s Kym?” It resuscitates him. It jars him into the
moment. Like an alarm.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: That’s unfair, Rachel. And completely
untrue.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And she’s even worse! “Dad, you’re never
going to believe this, but I lost the car again.” “Dad, you’re never
going to believe this, but that check you sent me never showed up and my
landlord hates me.” “Dad, can somebody meet me downstairs with cab fare
and you’re never going to believe this but I need to go to the emergency
room and my neighbor’s suing me and my checkbook got stolen!”</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Gee, Rach, sounds like you have some
paternal/sibling issues to work through.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Are you kidding? The two of you are like a
double helix of crises. In the language of psychology one could say you
both suffer from acute boundary issues.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Rachel! It’s nice that you’re getting your
Ph.D–</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: –Oh god–</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: –but don’t be patronizing. It’s ugly. It
doesn’t become you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How come she gets to spout off about
paternal issues, but god forbid I should even reference the “boundary
thing,” even though I actually know what I’m talking about?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Hello? By the way? I’m not in crisis. I haven’t
been in crisis for a year.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You just got out of rehab!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Why is this so difficult for you people to
understand? It’s like you’re not happy unless I’m in some kind of
desperate situation. You have no idea what to do with me unless I’m
desperate. God. Why am I the only one who’s willing to say this
stuff?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh, poor you. You’re so much more evolved in
your suffering. You know what? Your suffering is not the most important
thing in the world to everybody!</p>
<p><strong>30 continued: 30</strong>: RACHEL</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?!!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>everybody</strong>: Congratulations! Oh my god! Etc!!!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: That is so unfair!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: When did you find out?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Roughly about the day before we decided to
get married.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I can barely believe it myself!</p>
<p><strong>30 continued: 30</strong>: PAUL</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: We told her at dinner.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: She was so happy–</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Wait! Stop! You can’t just drop that tectonic
bit of information into a completely separate conversation, Rachel. You
can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kym, you’re going to have a niece!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Or a nephew!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oh, god. Of course I’m happy for you. But you
can’t tell me when we’re talking like this. It’s a total set-up!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I am so fucking exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Dad, will you tell her I’m happy for her?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I just…I need to go to bed. Sidney?</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Yeah, okay. Great idea. I’m beat too.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You’re leaving? In the middle of this
conversation?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kymmie, she’s pregnant. She’s exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Of course. Fair enough. I’m off to raid the
medicine cabinet.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: She’s not serious?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Oh, Rachel darling, and Sidney, I couldn’t be
happier.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: She wasn’t serious, was she?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Do either of you want anything? A sandwich?
You must be hungry. There’s cold Saagwala and a little Aloo Gobi left
over?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No thanks, Dad. I really am pretty
sleepy.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re pretty everything!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Holy cow. What a day. I think I’ve aged. I
mean it. Would you mind if I went to bed, darling?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Of course not. I’ll be up, Carol. I’m just
going to load the dishwasher.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Let me help, it’ll be quicker.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Don’t mess with the King.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Okay,okay.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Wow. That’s it for me too, you guys. Good
night everybody.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Congratulations, man.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Thanks, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’ve never been so tired in my life.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Yes, sweetheart?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I hope it’s okay, I told Mom at dinner.
About the baby.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Of course, lamb chop. I’m so happy! I’m going
to be a grandpa!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I wish Ethan were here.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I know, sweetheart. Me too.</p>
<p><strong>kieran’s voice off</strong>: That went well.</p>
<p><strong>31 int. basement. night. 31</strong>: Kieran and Kym lie
entangled in the basement, sharing a cigarette, disheveled. The floor of
this entire section of the basement is now covered with all of the
carefully arranged mattresses and futons that were stacked down here
before. All of Kym’s mismatched bags have been moved down here too.
There’s a little lamp there now as well but it’s not on. Only one of the
small, cobwebby windows casts a dappled light onto the scene.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: That was such a set-up.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: She probably didn’t realize she was doing
it.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Ha! She’s such an operator. Now I’m the bad guy
again. Or still.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: They’re lucky to have you.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Thank you! Otherwise they’d have to pay
attention to their own suspicious lives. Nobody actually wants me to
actually change, you know. What would they obsess about? I’m like a
blessing.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: No argument from me.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Dad had an actual “Blueprint for Rehabilitative
Success” at my last intervention. On graph paper. He goes all out with
the response, my dad.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Not unlike this great nation in which we
live.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Meanwhile an ex-heterosexual ex-boy friend of
mine actually rang the door once and tells my mother, “Kym is sitting in
her apartment? With the shades drawn? Doing all this heroin and cocaine?
And I think she’s going to, like, die?” And Mom smiles and says “Thank
you” like he was speaking in Sanskrit.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: You can’t actually speak in Sanskrit.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Exactly! I nodded out into the poached salmon
at Dad’s wedding two years ago and he told Carol he thought it was jet
lag.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: I did that in soup once. It made such a
mess.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Look how exquisite this is. I can’t borrow
this. What do you carry in here? A vital organ? A tiny spleen?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Isn’t it divine? It was grandma’s. She sends
her love.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I love the color. It’s oyster.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You must promise me you’ll stay healthy now,
Rachel. You’ll eat properly and get a lot of rest?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: How are things going at the house? How’s
Sidney?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: And his friend? What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kieran.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: He seems to be a big hit. Is your sister
behaving herself?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m not exactly sure what that means.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Well, she needs a lot of acknowledgement.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Stop. It can’t be easy. Everybody knowing her
troubles.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Mom, she’s sold syndication rights to her
troubles.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Mom, does it bother you at all, Carol doing
so much wedding stuff?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Not at all, darling, I’m thrilled to be
providing the flowers. You know how much that means to me. They’re going
to be exquisite!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes, I’m sure, and that’s so great and so
you, but you can do whatever else you want, you know. I’d love it.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Thank you, my sweetheart. I just know I’d be
one of those wedding mothers who goes completely insane about the hors
d’oeuvres. Andrew says I shouldn’t be allowed near a shrimp puff.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: There are so many other people for you to
worry about.</p>
<p><strong>35 continued: 35</strong>: ABBY</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re right.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: But this is going to be the most beautiful
wedding ever. And I hope your sister has a wonderful time too…Anyway I’m
going to be a grandmother! Hooray!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hooray!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’m so excited. I have always wanted to be a
grandmother. Even when I was thirty. Here. This ring was grandma’s and
she wanted you to have it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Is she dead?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s beautiful. Thanks, Mom. I hope it’s a
boy.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: As long as it’s healthy. Try the ring on.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You’ve always had the most beautiful
hands.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Your hand is on the turf.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: What turf?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: The turf. The table.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: So we have to do it over now. It was your
shot and you get to do it over.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Don’t tell me you didn’t know having one
hand on the turf makes the play null.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Null. Maybe we should just play Pinball.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Sometimes playing next to each other is
easier than playing together.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: My mom. She runs a pre-school.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: What’s Hawaii like?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: You’ve never been?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Uh uh.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: It’s beautiful. I’ve got a nice place. My
horse lives there.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Most people say “my girlfriend lives there” or
“my wife lives there.”</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: I live there and so does my horse. He’s very
possessive. We’re working through it.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Have you had him a long time?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Yes. I may be a degenerate dope fiend but I
love my horse. I don’t have a wife or a girlfriend and I’ve been clean
almost seven years. You could just ask, you know. Your sister doesn’t
ask direct questions either. She’s incredibly cryptic.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: That’s a shrink thing, not a genetic thing.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: We were in the park. I was sixteen and I was…I
had taken all these Percoset. I was unbelievably high.</p>
<p><strong>37 continued: 37</strong>: KYM</p>
<p><strong>38 ext. buchman back porch. day. 38</strong>: Paul, Rachel,
Emma, Sidney, and Norman Sklear are sprawled on the porch eating
sandwiches and figuring out the seating arrangement for the wedding by
manipulating tiny origami chickens, a tiny turtle, Monopoly pieces,
spools of thread, etc…each with a small name tag. Paul sees Kieran’s
rental pull up, grins, and calls to Carol…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Carol, they’re back!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Are you hungry? I made a Salad Nicoise. It’s
got Tuna!</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: I was just thinking Salad Nicoise!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Can we get back to what we were doing,
please?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: All right. Where were we? Ah yes…The
Rosenzwiegs. Can you please put the Rosenzwiegs somewhere far away from
me?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: They’re your friends, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: They’re not my friends. I’ve just known them
my entire life.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Just so you know, my mother expects to be
carried in by liveried servants to the triumphant swirls of the harp and
seated on a solid gold throne forged by nuns.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Really? Because right now I have her
shoveling kelp in the laundry room. But I have it as a montage.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Where are you putting me? In the stockade?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kym, stop it. You’re at the family table.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Don’t put me with Michael and Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: They’re not invited.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Sandy never called me back after I sent her an
amends e-mail from Milestones. I hate it when people don’t meet you half
way.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The family table. With us.</p>
<p><strong>close on seating placement board–</strong>: Paul moves Kym’s
“marker” – the MONOPOLY DOG – to the family table.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Oops. That’s nine. I thought you were having
tables of eight?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Where are you putting me?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I was thinking of putting you with Cookie
Puss and the Chicago cousins because they always get really drunk and
need wrangling.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Can someone else do it? I was planning on
enjoying myself.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re the only one they’re afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Still? God.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: We can move Grandma Rose and her companion.
That’s actually a great idea.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: That’s all I need. Another reason for Grandma
Rose to hate me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She doesn’t hate you.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: She’s still mad about that thing at the Rite
Aid.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Nonsense!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dad, can I show you something in the
kitchen?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Rachel, what is this behavior?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I would just like to have a day please.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Have all the days you want. Nobody is taking
your day.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Then why are you defending her?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Defending her from what? Darling, look, no
one’s defending any body…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why are you protecting her?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t want her to feel like we don’t want
her.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Sometimes I don’t want her. It’s my fucking
wedding, don’t you get it? I want my table to be perfect.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Stop it. She’s your sister.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay. Dishes? I’m going to load the
dishwasher.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Paul! Paul, listen, I’ve been thinking about
it. I did some preliminary sketches, I’d love to show them to you…</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: He’s not kidding.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: And I think if you move the salad bowls to
the upper tier you can get about 10% more stuff in the dishwasher.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Hee hee hee.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Sidney, you’re a nice young man. You make a
lot of money and the world is your oyster. But you don’t know shit about
loading a dishwasher.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Sir, with all due respect, the mantle has
passed.</p>
<p><strong>time cut–</strong>: Sidney has his sleeves up and starts to
load.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: What’s the time limit?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Are you comfortable with that, sir? I could
spot you thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You young people should all go fuck
yourselves.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: Ha!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You see Paul, I think your problem lies in
lid placement.</p>
<p><strong>39 continued: 39</strong>: SIDNEY</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Rachel, you’re out of the will.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Observe.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Clean out this machine please, boy. So I can
break out the whup-ass.</p>
<p><strong>sidney/kieran</strong>: He’s breakin’ out the whup ass!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: You know one of the early signs of senile
dementia is an obsessive need to organize.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Rachel, go fetch me my dart gun.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I find it touching but ultimately sad when
the warriors of yesteryear are reluctant to lay down their plastic
containers from Zabar’s and retire gracefully.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kieran, how’s my time?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: You have twenty-five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I need more dishes. You amateur!</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: What? No way!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Somebody give me some dishes!</p>
<p><strong>close on paul</strong>: He has a bowl in his hands. We see
the bowl is a plastic child’s bowl with Engines and Cabooses all over
it. Paul turns the bowl around in his hands like a steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>close on rachel –</strong>: She turns and leaves the kitchen.
Sidney follows her. Emma and Norman Sklear step out onto the porch.
Kieran takes the Ethan bowl from the sink and puts it quietly back in
the cupboard and shuts the door. Kym doesn’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Mom is handling the flowers?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, she’s growing them and choosing them -
but they are being delivered by her people.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Got it. Wow. Nurturing and growing things from
the soil. Textbook, right?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kym. Can we talk about the candles for a
minute? Because –</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Yeah, exactly! Candles and rice paper – all lit
up during the ceremony. It’s a way of honoring Ethan, Ethan’s… spirit,
you know? It will look really nice too, mainly. Millions of little
candles all over the place, and one huge rice paper candle -
representing Ethan - glowing near the couple. That would be you and
Sidney.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh my god, no. Don’t. Just don’t. That would
kill Dad. And Mom. And me. And everybody. Please, Kym, please please
please don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Geez. It was an IDEA. Lighten up, okay? They do
that in Japan or India or someplace, okay?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Just drop it, sweetie, okay? Please?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oh my god - fine! Done! It was nothing, okay.
It was just an idea.</p>
<p><strong>41 continued: 41</strong>: KYM</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Are you getting a manicure?</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: You don’t remember me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Nooooo…..</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: Rick James’ limousine.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oh. My. God.</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I meant to come back. I swear. I even had…Oh
god, what was it?</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: Peanut M&amp;M’s and Carbona cleaning
fluid.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: God is punishing me.</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: No, he’s blessing me. It’s cool: I talked
him down.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: So, how are ya?</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: I’m okay. You remember we were in the
hospital together, right?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: We were…at Milestones?</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: No. I didn’t go to Milestones. I didn’t
have the coverage. We were on the same floor at Loeb House. That was
before you went to Milestones.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Where did you go after that?</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: My parents’ house. Unemployment. It’s all
about the coverage, right?</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: I can’t believe I’m seeing you again.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I know. It’s so weird.</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: Listen. Do you remember that exercise where
we all had to write down experiences and pass them anonymously to
another person?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: “The Human Mirror: Seeing With a Fresh
Perspective” Like Secret Santas of despair.</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: I got yours.</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: You drew poodles in the margins. I know
it’s supposed to be anonymous and everything, but you were so brave. The
way your uncle abused you and your sister, and how it led to your
sister’s anorexia, and how you stayed up nights when she was down to
fifty pounds holding a mirror to her face to make sure she was
breathing. I’ll never forget reading that, I swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>rachel’s stylist</strong>: Do you want a tissue?</p>
<p><strong>stylist</strong>: I found it so profoundly inspirational that
you could be there for her during your own incredible ordeal. I thank
God that you came in here today. I never thought I’d ever have the
chance to thank you. It was your strength that gave me the courage to
confront my own abuse and help me turn my life around.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Would you stop?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Don’t you think his perspective might be a
little skewed?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I never had anorexia. You sure as hell
didn’t watch over me while I was sleeping and WE DON’T HAVE A</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: –That we know of!–</p>
<p><strong>hell and explains away all of your</strong>: SHIT IN ONE FELL
SWOOP!…Did you tell them that Dad forced us into a life of prostitution
while you were at it?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Ew!… Wait…</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I wasn’t hurting anybody. No one got hurt,
Rach.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m hurt!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I hate her.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You don’t hate her.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t tell me what I don’t hate. I hate,
hate the lies. She lied in rehab.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What do you mean she lied?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She lied to the people who were working with
her. Who were trying to help her. She lies to everybody.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where is she now?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Where am I now, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>kym’s voice off</strong>: Rachel! Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Thank god. In here.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Thanks for abandoning me. I had to take a
taxi!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Why would anything I said or didn’t say at the
hospital hurt you? It wasn’t about you!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why not? Why wasn’t it about me?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Rachel…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dad, stop. Why not? I was hopeful. I was on
your side. I still am. Do you have any idea what that means? Do you have
any idea how lonely it was with everybody gone into your terrible world?
There was nothing left. Everybody was just empty. You think they
remembered I was alive or needed anything during your… life? And after
all that loneliness and Mom and Dad blaming each other and worrying and
death and divorce and that stupid hopefulness and Dad not even being
able to listen to music, you were in the hospital, lying about us!
Instead of telling the truth about yourself!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: God, Rachel…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What’s this all
about?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Apparently she has a whole history of sexual
molestation.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kym, what is your sister saying? Did you say
you were sexually molested?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oh Jesus Christ. Not by you! It was a long time
ago!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Were you?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Why in god’s name would you say something like
that?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: It was anonymous! It seemed like a good idea at
the time.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Dad, look at me. I’m right here. I’m telling
you that after Ethan died I wanted her to get better or just die…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: And look! She is better!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Nice, Rachel. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: …And Dad, she was lying and she didn’t give
a shit about the rest of us. Recovery can’t work if you lie. She knows
that. I was worthless to her. We all meant nothing to her.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You’re not worthless. You’re my sister. I love
you guys. I need you guys, but you don’t get to sit around for the rest
of my life deciding what I’m supposed to be like. You weren’t there. You
weren’t inside my head when I was fucked up and your certainly not there
now. You haven’t got a clue what I feel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Kym, you took Ethan for granted. You were
high for his life. You were not present for his life. You were high. He
was like a pet to you. You drove him off the bridge. And now he’s
dead.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Yes! I was stoned out of my mind! Jesus Christ,
who do I have to be now? Mother Theresa? Did I use up all the love I’m
allowed for this lifetime because I killed our little brother?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, it was an accident!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I’m sorry! I’m sorry, okay? I’m sorry!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: It was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>49 int. buchman house. paul’s study. night. continuous.
49</strong>: He is alone and the door is shut</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hello Abby. It’s Paul.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Hello Paul.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Is Kym with you?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: No. Why? Did she go somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She left the house about an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: To a meeting?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She and Rachel had an argument.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Oh, dear. The night before her wedding? What
was it about?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Look, Abby, it doesn’t matter. She left the
house. She took the car.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: What was the argument about?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I don’t know. They were both getting their
hair done…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You don’t know? Well what were they
saying?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: For god’s sake Abby! I’m trying to figure out
where she went before I call the police!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Well, last time you called the police looking
for her she was upstairs, asleep in the guest room.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She wasn’t asleep, she was unconscious! And
I’m glad I called the police because it took twenty minutes to wake her
up and at least something was being done!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Paul, I’m trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re trying to dismiss everything!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: She’s not a criminal!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: You’re disregarding everything I’m saying, and
this failure to listen, failure to understand what is right in front of
you is exactly why you will never be able…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Paul!…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …To help her!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Maybe that’s not what she needs all the
time…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I mean..I mean maybe she needs us –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: – Maybe she needs someone to be watchful and
present and in her life!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: – To trust her –</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: She could hurt herself! She could be lying
dead in a ditch somewhere!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: All right! All right! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: If you hear anything, can I count on you to
please call me?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Can you count on me?…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Yes Paul, you can count on me to call if I
hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Okay, then.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Abby hasn’t heard from her.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: She must feel awful.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Excuse me, but when you’re trying to get
better there’s a lot of pressure in rehabs… when someone isn’t ready to
take responsibility they create something, like an Uncle Stan, to take
responsibility until they’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Well, she’s always been creative.</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: I just wish we knew where she was.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Paul, Would you like me to go out and look
for her?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: You’re getting married tomorrow. A hundred
people will be here.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: I’ll go. I’m…I’ll go. Any idea where she
might have gone?</p>
<p><strong>carol</strong>: It’s the caterer.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’ll take it.</p>
<p><strong>53 int. abby’s/andrew’s house. night. 53</strong>: Abby is in
her kitchen preparing tea, dressed in loose- fitting yoga-style PJs,
hair still wet from her bath. A door opens behind her and Kym emerges
from the bathroom rubbing her hands over her face.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Ahhh….</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You should call your father.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: In a minute. I need a glass of water.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I’ve made some tea.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Here darling. Sit down. You look upset.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: When will Andrew be back?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Not too late. He’s at a dinner.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: I spoke to grandma today. She sends her love.
Is everything all right with the wedding?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Dad was loading the dishwasher…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Mmm hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: And I handed him Ethan’s bowl with the trains
on it by accident.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Why did you leave me in charge of him?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You knew. All of you knew. People told you. I
was a junkie.</p>
<p><strong>53 continued: 53</strong>: KYM</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You were sick.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You know what I was. It’s not like there
weren’t any clues. I stayed in my room for days. I passed out all the
time. Where were you, Mom! What were you thinking? Why did you leave me?
Why did you leave me in charge of him?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: You weren’t supposed to kill him! You weren’t
supposed to kill him!</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Mom?</p>

A curve in the road, squealing around it. The road forks twenty yards

Kym’s face – airbag deflates, Kym’s head falls forward, bangs against

day.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I was thinking about getting her a cat. Cats
are really annoying. At some point you have to deal with them, right? Or
they starve to death and piss on your sheets.</p>

people.</p>

<p><strong>kym</strong>: Why are you going to Washington?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: It’s the mother of all fund raisers at
American. I thought I mentioned it. We’re going to stay on about a week
- there are lots of meetings. I thought since you two are going away
soon… …and I’m sure you don’t want any grown ups around checking up on
you…Will you still be here when I get back?</p>

reconnaissance, Mom?</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Well, can you come by early?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Um…</p>

wedding night. You don’t want to get up early. I have to get Andrew
organized. He’s hopeless. And we’ll be back in a bit. It was such a
lovely wedding, darling.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Wait! I want my mother and my sister!</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Rachel…</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Will you call me every day about…?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: All right, then.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: Goodbye Abby.</p>
<p><strong>abby</strong>: Good bye, Son-in-law.</p>
<p><strong>sidney</strong>: I saw your mother’s underwear.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I can’t find my cigarettes.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Kymmie. Speak of the devil. You remember
Susanna Galeano.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>susanna</strong>: Hi Kym.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Susanna has a public relations firm and she
just lost one of her assistants.</p>
<p><strong>susanna</strong>: Weddings. They’re an epidemic. Your father
gave me my start about a hundred years ago.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No, no. Hardly. Well…</p>
<p><strong>susanna</strong>: We could definitely use an extra body right
about now. Have you ever thought about Public Relations?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: The public is kind of afraid of me.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: The firm is opening an office right here in
town, just in time for the holidays. You could stay right here.</p>
<p><strong>susanna</strong>: Have you ever thought about P.R. Kym?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Logistically it’s just a dream. You could stay
in your old room. I could chauffeur you around. You wouldn’t have to
worry about rent.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Have you already talked to Carol about me
staying here?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Of course. She’s fine about it. You could stay
in your old room.</p>
<p><strong>susanna</strong>: Why don’t you give me a call on Monday,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>susanna</strong>: Goodbye Paul. It was just beautiful. Bye
Kym.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Suzy’s first rate. P.R. can be
fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: You always said it was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I meant stupid. Do you want me to hold that
for you? You’ve got no pockets.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I’ve got it. Thanks, Dad. I’ll be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>83 int. buchman stairway. day. 83</strong>: Kym slipping
quietly downstairs. She moves to collect her weird mish-mash of bags
waiting by the door.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Oof. You scared me.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Making a break for it?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Yeah. I have to go. I was coming to find
you.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: You don’t have to slip away without making
any noise, you know? I like noise.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I was coming to find you. My ride’s
outside.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: …Okay…If you need anything…</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: If I need to post bond?</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: No. If you ever need anything.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Thank you, Kieran.</p>
<p><strong>kieran</strong>: Maybe you’ll come visit me in Hawaii?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: That would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I have to go. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>84 ext. front porch. day. 84</strong>: Kym looks back in
through the window, sees her father awake, in his robe, tired, gamely
tidying.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Dad.</p>
<p><strong>rosa</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Will you tell Dad?</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: I love your baby!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>kym</strong>: Bye!</p>
