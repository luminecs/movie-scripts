<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: If you’re shocked when someone aims kindness
your way. That oughta tell you somethin’ about yourself.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: And put a cuppa bleach in, next time
through.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: Partridge.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Uh. No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: It’s my name.</p>
<p><strong>punch</strong>: I don’t like that.</p>
<p><strong>punch</strong>: Partridge says you’re not as dumb as you
look.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: How could I be?</p>
<p><strong>punch</strong>: Anyway, that’s why I’m takin’ a chance on
you. Partridge said he’d re-write whatever of your stuff. Stay late…</p>
<p><strong>punch</strong>: We’re a family paper. Upbeat stories with a
community slant. Self-help stuff: Are You a Break- fast Alcoholic?…Guide
to Getting Dumped…like that.</p>
<p><strong>punch</strong>: City Planning Board meeting at two- thirty.
Three hunnerd words max. Sink or swim.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I think my brother said that once.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Maybe it was my father.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Sink or swim, pig-butt.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I’m not a water person.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: See, three hunnerd words would be, like,
one page. This is…oh, fifteen, sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: So we should cut it.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: Gonna have to.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Or you could tie me in a sack, throw me in
the river. Tell the police you thought it was oddly-wrapped lard.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: Might be quicker.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Does your wife like special pickles? They’re
fine with cold cuts.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: Come by for supper, tomorrow. We’ll</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: We. Got you this.</p>
<p><strong>mercalia</strong>: It’s…an anniversary present. Anniversary
of our friendship.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Seven and a half month anniversary?</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: Well. Why wait?</p>
<p><strong>mercalia</strong>: It’s because we’re happy. About
something.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: Mercalia and me are movin’. To
California. Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: You know she’s been learnin’ to drive a
rig. She got the Oakland to New Orleans run. I’m gonna make her smoked
duck sandwiches for the road. I can edit copy anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: Love’s all that counts. It’s the engine
of life.</p>
<p><strong>partridge</strong>: We’ll just. Stay in touch.</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Petal Bear, Mr. Quoyle.</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Do you hate this shit, or what?</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: What do you think? You want to marry me,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Buy me a drink somewhere, it’s seven-thirty.
I think I’m going to fuck you by ten. What do you think of that?</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: You are quite. The raconteur.</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Christ. I won the lottery.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: It was pretty much like that for a
month.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Somewhere in there. We got married.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: After that, I had to follow her to see
her.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Which I know was wrong of me.</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: What do you think? You want to marry me,
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: She didn’t know she was pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Hey. How do you make an Alabama Slammer?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Uh. Where are y…</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Alabama. Hence, the question.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Come home. I’ll make you one.</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: That’s a swell idea. Now go look on top of
the fridge, where I keep the Mr. Boston. I’ll wait.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You okay? Except for being thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: I’m busy, I’ll see y…</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Me too. I’ll tell Bunny you miss her.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: There’s. Cold chicken.</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Find yourself. A girlfriend. With what you
got down there, you’ll do fine.</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Only thing can work, here. Is divorce.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I knew we had our problems. But I never
thought I’d hear that word.</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Your funeral, pussy.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I knew if I could take it. In the end. It
would all work out.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Lila, it’s Daniel. Ten-thirty. Bring
the. You know.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Quoyle, this is your father. Calling you.
Dicky’s machine is full. Your home one’s broke. Well. It’s time for your
mother and I to go.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Instructions about the undertaker. The
cremation. On the dining room table.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You’ll have to make your own way. I did.
Nobody gave me nuthin’. Other men woulda give up, turned to bums. I
sweated, wheeled barrows of sand, went without so you and yer brother
could have advantages. Not that you did much with your chances.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Hasn’t been much of a life. Tell Dicky and
my sister Agnis Hamm. Her number’s on the dining room ta…</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: That was your final message.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Brain tumor and liver cancer. One
apiece.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Dicky. It’s Mom and Poppa. They.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: So. For the funeral, I thou…</p>
<p><strong>brother</strong>: You think I’d go pay that prick respects?
You got me confused with you!</p>
<p><strong>brother</strong>: Hey, Barfbag. They leave us anything,
y’think?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Don’t see how. Big mortgage. Spent their
savings on the doctors. I hadda send some grocery mon…</p>
<p><strong>brother</strong>: Well, see, that’s why he did it. I mean,
think how it felt. Taking from you.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Sorry, Ed. I gotta drive down to my parents’
place. I’ll be back, Friday.</p>
<p><strong>punch</strong>: Take yer time. I gotta let you go.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: In what sense do you m…</p>
<p><strong>punch</strong>: As in canned.</p>
<p><strong>punch</strong>: Yer not the only one. Eventually.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Should I finish the sawmill piece?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moosup</strong>: Well, that may take awhile.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moosup</strong>: She came in at one, packed like crazy.
Said she was movin’ to Florida with the guy in the red Geo. You know the
one.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moosup</strong>: She says you gotta pay my wages for the
sittin’. Seven weeks, comes to $3080. ’Preciate a check right n…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moosup</strong>: Don’t bother. She took Bunny with
her.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That’s the last thing she’d ev…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moosup</strong>: She was real clear about my check. It’s
no fun workin’ if you don’t get paid.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: At least she took her toys. Wanted her to be
happy.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. moosup</strong>: Mr. Quoyle? I ain’t got all day,
here!</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Quoyle. Q-U-O-Y-L-…no, Y, then L-E. Yeh,
it’s my kid.</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: Is this Mr. Guy Quoyle?</p>
<p><strong>male voice</strong>: This is Lt. Amos Figg of the
Mockingburg, New York Police. Could you have him call me when he
ret…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: He’s passed on. He’s dead. You said
Mockingb…</p>
<p><strong>figg</strong>: We’re a small town upstate. I’m actually
trying to reach his son. He allegedly went down to his parents’ place
two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Are you a detective, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>figg</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well, as you’ve probably deduced, I am his
son. Cause I’m at his place. As alleged.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Which is…?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: The good. Please.</p>
<p><strong>figg</strong>: Your daughter Bunny was sold by your wife to a
child pornographer. For $9000.</p>
<p><strong>figg</strong>: But she’s fine. We got her. And the doc says
she wasn’t touched. Yet. If you catch my drift.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That’s. The good n…</p>
<p><strong>figg</strong>: Well. Compared.</p>
<p><strong>figg</strong>: Your wife was in a red Geo which went through
a guardrail over the Chesapeake Bay Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>figg</strong>: They were doin’ 97 in a fog. The</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: And Petal…?</p>
<p><strong>figg</strong>: May never find the body. But she was
mercifully killed on impact, without a doubt. They found her shoes under
the dash and her… trousers for some reas…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That don’t mean for sure she w…</p>
<p><strong>figg</strong>: …and her purse. With the nine large.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Hi, too. That for me?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Where’s our candy?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: In the store. That way, you’ve got the whole
selection.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Give us a minute.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I mean him.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Petal went to Florida. She’ll be back
soon.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: She had an accident.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: So do you.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: There was a car crash, sweetie. And they
found…you know, the body. Of her friend.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Nestor.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Petal can’t come back, she’s dead. You know
dead. Like the turtle.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: We found the turtle. And they found Nestor.
Did you find Petal?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: You never do. But she always comes back.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Nephew, I’m your Aunt. Agnis Hamm.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: You sick? It’s nine o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Uh. No, Bunny and I like to… uh, early to
bed, earl…</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Losin’ your wife, your folks, and your job’d
depress anybody. It’s a wonder you don’t sleep all day.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Thought I’d stay a day or two. Give you some
relief with th…</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: I got one in the car.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I never knew her, really.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: But she was driven by terrible forces, no
one could understand. She was a locked door. Even to me.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: So she wasn’t just a bitch in high heels?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Don’t stress. She mighta heard worse from her
momma. I’m only guessin’.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Some people probably thought Petal was bad
clear through.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: People. Are a cynical lot.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I think she just couldn’t get enough
love.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: I think the evidence. Is on your side.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: I’m headed north, Nephew, to where our family
comes from, in Newfoundland. Thought I’d never go back. But the older
y’get…</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: There’s a pull. Becomes an ache. As if where
your people started held a purpose for you. Like you’re a piece in a
puzzle…</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: …lookin’ for where y’fit.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: In what sense do you m…</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: You need to come, Nephew.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Nothin’ here but hurt. You got to start
fresh, everythin’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: The trip’ll clear your head. Be educational
for the squirt. Teach ya the world’s still spinnin’ outside this toxic
slice o’Hades. And who knows…?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: They must have a newspaper up there.
Somebody’s gotta write it.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Tell the truth, I’d appreciate the company.
You two are pretty much my family.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: A pot o’coffee would hit the spot. Drop
o’whiskey would fit nice in it.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Which one’s my brother?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Uh. There’s Mom. And that’s Poppa.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Those are temporary.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Coffee. And maybe a sweet.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: She needs to go outside.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I know why.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: What say, Guy? The dumpster?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Just a thought.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: They draft off our air currents, it’s quite
premeditated.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: They actually know the ferry schedule. Show
up on time better’n the Newfies.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: …image of m’sister, Feeny. She’s married to a
falconer in Arabia, now. Has to wear a black</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Like the falcon.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Nice. To be with family.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: ’Specially big shots. Who can land a job with
one phone call.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well, that was my friend Partridge. Made the
call. And it’s just an interview.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: On the map, here. Quoyle Point. Named after
us. You.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: The green makes me hurl. Her, too.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Empty 44 years. And look at that roofline,
straight as a ruler.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Take it easy. Floor mighta fallen into the
cellar.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Up those stairs, Aunt Pinkie slept. So fat
she couldn’t get down to her chamber pot. Wanna see if she’s still
there?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Well. Too late to drive that road back ’round
the bay. We’ll camp in here tonight. Be right as rain.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Which one’s Petal’s room? I’ll sleep
there.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Is that a belt or a crown?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Sodas get flat withou…</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: This is important.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That why the Barbies are watching?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: They’re being nice and patient.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: They must be chilly, tho. Should I get their
clo…</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: They look better this way. They have great
bodies.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I need it. I look good in blue.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I was lookin’ for that all over our old
place. The landlady s…</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I need it.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You had quite the heavy morning. Take the
rest of the day off.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Be right back, and we’ll start talking
breakf…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Yeh, her farts are pretty scary.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I mean. The white one!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: The White Dog with the big teeth and the red
eyes. The Skinny Ghost owns him. They came last night.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I didn’t dream ’em, don’t say I did.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I was gonna say. I’ll keep my eyes
peeled.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Be cheaper to build a new one. On the
Riviera, even.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Only I weren’t born. On the Riviera.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Flour Sack Cove. What time’s your interview
at that paper? Ten o’clock?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: The drive’s a bitch. We’ll buy us a boat.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I’m not. A water person.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: …not a water person.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Someone found a pretty wife.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Someone always does.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: As you can see, sometimes y’can’t get away.
I’m Tert X. Card, the bloody so-called managing editor, copyeditor,
rewrite man, mechanicals, ad makeup department, mail and distribution
chief, and snow shoveler.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: And you are either a big advertiser come to
buy a four-page spread to push your warehouse of left-footed Japanese
boots. Or. You. Are the breathlessly-awaited Quoyle.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That’d be me. The second one.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: Have to do without the Ultimate Cheese,
y’will. Himself, Mr. Jack Buggit, is up at the house having charms said
over his scrawny chest to clear out that impressive accumulation of
phlegm he’s been hawking all week.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: Billy does the Home News page. Poems, baby
photos, household tips, and a gossip column, under the byline of Junior
Sugg, that is pretty much straight libel.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: In short. He writes the only stuff anybody
actually reads.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: Now this miserable ugly Brit, is B. Beaufield
Nutbeem. Imagines he’s the foreign news chief. Steals every story off
that foul shortwave radio and rewrites it in Limey prose.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Mine: ‘Burmese sawmill owners and the
Rangoon Development Corporation met in Tokyo Tuesday to consider a joint
approach to marketing tropical hardwoods.’</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Card’s rewrite: ‘Burnoosed sawbill awnings
and the Ranger Devotional Competition met Wednesday near Tokyo to mark
up local hairwood.’</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: It’s shorter, and I got Tokyo right.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: If misspelled.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: Now what’s funnier, Quoyle? My writing style,
or the fantasy that any Newfie would read that moosepuckey in the first
pIa…</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: There’s your miserable desk, Quoyle. We’ve got
no idea what yer s’posed to do. But Mr. Jack Buggit will drop by someday
and enlighten us all. Til then…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Listen to this. ‘Well, we see the postman
has landed in jail for 45 days for throwing the mail in Killick-Claw
Harbor. He said he had too much to deliver, and folks could just take a
dip and help themselves.’</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: This is great stuff. ‘A snowmobile mishap
has taken the life of 78-year- old Rick Puff, who was on his way home
from what the Widow Puff calls a ’screech-in and a carouse,’ when his
machine fell through the ice. A well- known accordion player, Mr. Puff
had served four years in the 1970s for sexual assault on his daughters.
Bet they aren’t crying, either.’ This Billy Pretty can really write!</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Nephew, we can’t fix up the house proper on a
journalist’s wages. So I have un-retired.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: From what?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Upholstery. Been sought after for 33 years,
wherever I’ve lived. This should be the real test, huh?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: This is Dennis Buggit, master carpenter.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Only til I get my lobster license. I’m a
fisherman in my soul.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: It’s a Newfie thing, the compulsion to fish.
Y’hear yesterday’s tragedy</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Brought home 200 pounds of ice. His wife
fried it. They both drowned.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: With me workin’, we’ll need day care for
Bunny after school. Turns out Dennis and his wife send their little girl
to this wonderful saintly woman. How’s that for us livin’ a charmed
life?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Agnis says yer buyin’ a boat. Sooner’s
prob’ly better’n lat…</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Well, course we’re buy…</p>

<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Headline. Dog Fart Fells Freelance Reporter.
Promising Career Nipped in Bud.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: It’s called cancer.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Based on my I.Q. test, huh. Where’d I
rate?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Pleased t’meetcha, Billy says yer workin’
out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tert Card says he’s keepin’ an eye on ya.
Since he’s a self-servin’ liar, helluva ad salesman tho, it means he’s
jealous. And Nutbeem…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nutbeem’s obsessed with actual news. Makes up
for it by manning the sexual abuse desk. Can’t keep up with the volume
there, we’re runnin’ three, four a week.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Card’s in charge. Ya hear this and that ’bout
his typos, but typos is part of Gammy Bird. Everyone gets a laugh, and
gets to figger ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: An’ Billy. Well, Billy’s a writer and a
fisherman. Me, I’m just a fisherman.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Fishin’ and the sea is all I am. My pap the
same. My boy.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: So he said. Waitin’ for his license.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Naw, my boy’s passed. Went to sea and there he
rests. Bless his bones.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Want two things from ya, Quoyle. First. You
cover every local car wreck, take pictures. Front-page photo every week,
whether we have a wreck or not, an’ we always do. When we don’t, we dip
into Card’s file, he’s got some beauties.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Knack to this. If there’s a dark patch on the
ground, it reads blood, whether it’s motor oil or Diet Coke. Gloves,
hat, lyin’ in the road…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …somethin’ that humanizes, makes ya feel.
That’s what a wreck is. It’s always saying, ‘There but for the grace of
God…’</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Plus. We’re starting a feature on the shipping
news. What ships come in, what goes out. Whatever’s of interest.
Throwin’ it to you, son. Chance to shine.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Mr. Buggit. I’m not. Well, a water
person.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Chance. To shine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: One peculiarity. I’m no joke, son, and I don’t
tolerate jokes about Newfies. Or them that does.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: So this Newfie comes to Toronto. Cabbie
says, take ya to meet girls for a good time. Boy says, okay, but I only
want a Newfie girl.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Right section of the party district, he
finds a girl, they have sex, she says that’s a hunnerd dollars. He says
fine, tips her another hunnerd! She says, wow, can y’come back
t’morrow?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Next two nights, same thing!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: He says, I know. Yer ma asked me t’give ya
six hunnerd dollars!</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Yer the model Newfie, Q, but fer th’boat.
Why doncha buy Nutbeem’s?</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: I built a Chinese junk. Sailed it up from
Brazil. Missed Manhattan by a mile or so, got stranded here when I
shipwrecked by Gaze Island.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Almost finished my repairs. Be leaving
soon. As paleontologists define the term.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: She’s ugly. And the only thing I’ve ever
loved.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Yer story tugs at me bladder.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Him and Jack. Tell it.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Jack Buggit’s psychic, start with that.
He’s got the gift. Specially about the sea.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Older brother Jesson, everyone’s favorite,
even Dennis’. Goes to sea like his dad. One day, rest of the family’s
sitting by the radio, and Jack goes white…</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Stands up. Says, Jesson’s gone. Walks out
of the house. Grief too big for walls to hold it.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: So Dennis is forbidden the sea. But being
free, Newfie, and 21, he goes anyway.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: And that’s enough t…?</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Death storm. Monster wave cracks her steel
hull amidships, one inch crack from starboard to port. Men go in the
water. Dennis lost. After a week…</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: They come to Jack, call off the search. He
stands like a stone. Then turns, sharp, the way he does. Says only,
‘He’s alive. And I know where.’</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Man’s a witch.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Went to sea, alone, in just a skiff. Finds
him. Can you guess the odds? Finds him. Finds him. Both arms broke, 99%
dead.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Boy comes to. Jack says if you ever</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Say it fast.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Says fishin’ licenses are all spoken for,
I’d appreciate you givin’ me yours. Jack looked in his eyes. They never
spoke ag…</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: What’s bein’ blabbed here?</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Quoyle’s right.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: To my ass.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I’ll drink to that.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Hey, how ’bout we ask what’s wrong with you?
There’s nothing wr…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Which one of those women is in charge
here?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Neither of ’em. They’re just moms.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well, my lord, whoever runs the place should
be giving this a little more attention.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: You think.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I mean, children need structure. No one’s
even guarding that craft table, they could be running around with
scissors and get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Um. I write for the newspa…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Well. I’d better get to work, I see.
Providing structure and all.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I’m Wavey Prowse, and this is my place.
Pardon our antiquated emphasis on individuality and the freedom to have
fun.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Oh, yeh. Running with sharp objects? We save
for Tuesdays.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well, she don’t wear a ring, cause she lost
her husband at sea. Just after the boy was born.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well, I was just…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: …sharpenin’ those observation skills. First
tool of a quality reporter.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: She has wonderful. Posture.</p>
<p><strong>melville</strong>: Ever seen anything like her?</p>
<p><strong>melville</strong>: I mean. The ship.</p>
<p><strong>melville</strong>: It was built for Hitler. You’ve heard of
Hitler? Up here in Canada?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Oh, yessir. He was in all the papers. Way
back.</p>
<p><strong>melville</strong>: Finest botterjacht ever built in Holland.
Flat-bottomed, she can go right up on shore in a storm. Incredibly
heavy, forty tons of oak. Not unlike the barges of Henry VIII and
Elizabeth I.</p>
<p><strong>silver</strong>: Tell them what happened. In</p>
<p><strong>melville</strong>: Pounded twelve beach houses. Expensive
ones. To rubble.</p>
<p><strong>silver</strong>: Now tell them. Who let our insurance
lapse.</p>
<p><strong>silver</strong>: Took six very expensive lawyers to weasel us
out of it. An inch from bankruptcy.</p>
<p><strong>silver</strong>: Moral of the story? When you marry a tour
guide. Confine his authority to mixing the drinks. Same again, dear?</p>
<p><strong>silver</strong>: My dining salon needs refitting. And the
best custom yacht upholsterer in the Northern Hemisphere just moved
here. I was forced. To follow.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You are a woman of mystery, Aunt. Mystery
and surprise.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You said upholstery. Never said yacht
uphol…</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: …never said not. Ask better questions, you
got a chance fer better answers. Got my shop set up in Killick-Claw,
now.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Two good workers. Mrs. Mavis Bangs is an old
plow horse like m’self. But Dawn…</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Dawn’s young and on the sexy side. You oughta
drop by and say hullo.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Where’s Bunny?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Upstairs, in what will soon become her room.
She’ll be all right.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Little early in the day f…</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Warren died today. That’s what that
means.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Poor old girl.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: I used to live with someone named Warren.
Died of cancer, after nine years together. Dearest soul on this
earth.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Went from the funeral, and bought that dog.
Named her Warren. Just so I could say the name a hunnerd times a day.
Women are foolish, huh?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I never thought so.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Bunny wants to bury the dog with me. But I
told her I’d rather do it alone.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Some advice about the child?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Don’t get down on her level, the way you do.
She’ll never respect you.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: That’s the difference.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Another necklace, huh? Can I help?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: You can watch.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Do I have to take my clothes off?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: You look better with ’em on.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You know. You do look good in blue.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Give you folks a lift?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: We’re enjoyin’ the walk, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well. My aunt can’t bring Bunny to the
daycare, she’s got her shop now. But I worked it out with my boss. So
I’ll be bringin’ her come next week.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: If that’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Love to have her. I’m sorry, Mr. Quoyle,
about the other time. Women can be moody, you know. And
temperamental.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Only the best ones.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Good afternoon, Dennis. Give our respects to
Beety and Marty.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Excellent posture.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: People talk.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: You were a good girl, Warren, no trouble
a’tall.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: So the Newfie drills another hole in the
ice, aways off from the first one. Once again, the voice booms,</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: The Newfie looks around. Still nobody.
Hollers, WHO ARE YA? THE VOICE O’ GOD? Voice comes back, NO! THE ARENA
MANAGER!</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Heard it before, huh?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Sometimes, passion in performance. Beats the
element of surprise.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You guys hungry?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Shhh. I’m teaching Herry to read. Just like I
did Warren.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Is he learnin’?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: First is the teaching part. The learning
comes later.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Wavey? Now are the berries ready to pick?</p>
<p><strong>petal</strong>: Want to pick my berries, do you. Should I
climb right up on this sink?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Almost. Almost ready. You know, it’s all
about timing.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: That’s yer boat.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Said it was.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: One question remains. Why. Is that. Yer
boat?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well. A boat’s a boa…</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: It’s a shit boat. Best thing, get rid of it
some dark night.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Go hire Alvin Yark to build ya a sweet little
rodney. This thing’s a wallowing cockeyed bastard that’ll sink in a
bathtub.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m goin’ fishin’.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Don’t jump off a bridge over it. Anyone can
make a brainless, asinine, devastatingly revealing blunder.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: What in th’ furry pit of Newfie hell. Is
this!?</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: Hitler’s Barge…?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That goes with the shipping news. Profile of
a vessel in port.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: What about the car accident?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That’s the one I didn’t do. Mrs. Diddolate
sprained her wrist. Period.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: So you didn’t do the one Jack told yer to do,
and you did one he don’t know yer did!</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Pretty mu…</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: This copy. Is worse. Than yer boat.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Run it.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: As for the part about you havin’ half a
mind? No comment.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Headline. Reporter Disembowels Self With
Rusty Joke.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Jack, I completely understand, I would fire
me, too.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: In a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You give me a chance, and what happens? I
buy the wrong boat, I write the wrong story, I am the lowest form of
alleged life. In fact, your comment…</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Egg salad and Nehi grape.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: They’re mine but I’ll share.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: And if you don’t move. Until I get there.
Then…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: …then you win!</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That. Was so easy.</p>
<p><strong>card</strong>: Did ya see the Hitler’s barge piece,
Jocko?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I saw it. And heard from some who’d done the
same. Good. Neatness.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Reorganize. Start over. Good thinking.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Thing about the barge piece? I just thought
it’d perk up th…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Got six phone calls ’bout that piece. Six.
That’d be like half a million calls in Toronto.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: People liked it, old son. Crowd went down to
the dock t’see the thing, but it’d already pulled out.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Course you don’t know anything about boats,
but that’s entertaining, too. So go ahead with it. That’s the kinda
stuff I want, see?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: From now on, you write a column every week.
The Shipping News. Gonna order you a computer and everything. And y’know
the beauty part…?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t have to tell Card all over again,
cause he’s already eavesdroppin’. So I’m free to take m’leave.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Goin’ fishin’?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ah. You’ve an instinct for character and
idiosyncrasy, old son.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Zip yer fly, Card.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Thirty-eight years. First time anybody said
you done it right.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Nephew, this is Mavis Bangs. A real
professional.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: And this is Dawn Budgel. She’s a

<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Agnis is always saying such…things about you.
It’s nice to fit a man.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I just, uh, came to see if you’d heard

<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Silver Melville? Snuck off in the night, they
did. Not a penny paid for all we done.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: We’d installed the banquettes in her salon.
Three of the chairs done and delivered, three to go…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That’s. That’s just terrible.</p>

<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: In New York. They said she had a…
personality disorder.</p>

Ghost. Kids do things like that, it’s called imagination. Like the
necklaces.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You know how many she makes?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: It’s a skill, she’s proud of it. And she
brings her dolls along. And she looks good in blue. And she wears a key
for a good luck charm.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: And she’s saving her mother a room. Did she
tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You know how kids think. You have all those
books.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: The ones I read to teach Herry. They don’t
make me an exp…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I mean. If you had to guess..</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: That child is the only friend my son ever
had. So she’s strange, you bet.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I love that little girl. And I will see to
it. That she’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: And I don’t have to guess about it.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I want us. To be friends, okay?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: And friends. Need. To understand each
other.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: My husband drowned. Herry was…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: He was two months old. And Herold took the
boat out. Overnight. To fish for haddock.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Because I liked. Haddock.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: It’s four years.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: And it’s yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Now, did I blow it. Or can you still be my

I think he’ll sit up nights thinking of cheap shots to pay you back. I
think he’ll never stop until you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I think I haven’t been so proud. Of a friend.
Since I don’t know when.</p>

<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: …and will I see her?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jesus Cockadoodle Christ! I knowed somebody
was out here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thank god fer yer figure, me old son. A thin
man woulda froze.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Good. Yer lost th’boat.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Actually. It’s just my bed.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Actually, it’s not. I just wanted to see your
eyes bug out like that.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Only when I’m worried. I don’t worry
much.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You don’t have to, I’m all right. I’m in
heaven.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I’m not worried. About you.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Mrs. Buggit called, knew Bunny was still with
me. The kids are camped out in the parlor.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Nice. You sittin’ up with me.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: S’okay. Someday you’ll do somethin’ nice for
me.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Who you worried ab…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: You didn’t find a second dead man. Just the
rest of the first one.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I asked. Who you worried about?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: You said Bunny talks to Petal at night. You
ever listen?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Not really. Wouldn’t be right.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Well, I’m not that nice a person.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: She plays Petal. Talks to the Barbies, like
Petal talking to her.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: She says she’s sorry she left them. It was
just to see if they could be good girls. And they were…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: …and she loves them.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: The Barbies look better naked, Bunny looks
good in blue, guess who said that?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: So we talked. Just before Petal left her with
that…stranger? Bunny had snapped her mom’s bead necklace. That’s why
she’s making more.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: When she’s made enough. She’ll be
forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: She saves Petal a room at the house, but
she’s also got the key to the old place. In case her mom would rather go
there.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: And she talked about it. Just like that.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Sure, I lied. I said nice things about her
mother.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: See, there’s only one problem. Petal isn’t
gone.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: So we’re patient. And we wait, and we’re
good to her. And. Maybe. Time.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well, hurry up. Thirty, forty years I’ll be
rarin’ to get back out on the water.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Gotta build her solid. Who knows, mebbe Jack
Buggit’ll give his fishin’ license to his boy. So next time, won’t be
nobody to pull yer out.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: His kid never got a fishin’ license.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: What we wait fer? She’s like the main stem.
Gives us our shape, doncha see.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Death’s one shape. Fergiveness is
another.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Thing ‘bout waitin’ on fergiveness? Mixes up
who’s waitin’ on who.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Death is simpler. An’ a lot shorter
wait.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. yark</strong>: Mr. Quoyle…?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. yark</strong>: The school is callin’? It’s about yer
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: …not only pushed Mrs. Lumball. Not</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: She knocked. Her down.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: And. Refuses to explain her act. Or.
Apologize.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Under the circumstances. We have no
choice but to suspend.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Uh. Wavey? If it’s all the same to you…</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: When you gonna ask?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: She musta done something. Really bad.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: She’s the worst one of all!</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Herry told her he had to pee. But the way he
talks. He could just say ‘eeee,’ like that.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: She told him that recess was almost over, an’
she wasn’t gonna make a trip special, an’ he could hold it.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: She made him stand against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: See, a good dad would say hitting is always
wrong. You coulda hurt her bad. I guess you know that.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: She wasn’t hurt for real. Just screamed like
a baby.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Wish I’d seen it. It really sounds
funny.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Petal’ll think so, too.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well, there won’t be any trouble at school.
I’II take care of that.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Because the best thing about people. Is they
can forgive each other. I heard that this morning.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: That teacher. Is gonna forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That. And she won’t want the story printed
in the paper.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Well. I don’t wanna forgive her.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I had to do it. ’Cept for Wavey, I’m the only
family Herry’s got.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Like the ghost. Who’s not a ghost.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: The one who ties the knots? You’re</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: You said.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Uncle. My daughter Bunny and I. We got you
some hot bread. And some meat. Some dried fish. Some squash and
vegetables…a cake…some warm clothes…</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Ain’t yer house, it’s th’ Ouoyle house!</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: See, I am Qu…</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Old ones. Got run outta Omaloor Bay a hunnerd
years ago. Dragged that house across th’ ice. On spruce runners.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Hadda lash it to th’ rock. She’ll tell
yer.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Course she never come t’see me. That’s
obvious why.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Your Aunt Agnis Hamm, me son. That’s cause
she can’t face me. I knows she killed ’im.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Him.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: That baby she was carryin’. What was she
t’do? She wuz only 12. An’ it was her own brother what done ’er.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Her brother, me son. She only had th’
one.</p>
<p><strong>nolan</strong>: Course no one alive knows no more. So her an’
me… Our. Little. Secret.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: What? My hem crooked? As if I was wearin’ a
hem.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Naw, I just come from seein’ your cousin
Nolan. Guess I was thinkin’ about him.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Mr. Quoyle? What do you think of my dress?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I wore it just for you.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That was more consideration. Than I
deserve.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Did your aunt tell you about all</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Agnis told us it came from Macau.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: …from Silver Melville. And it was more than
she expected. And we shipped the chairs off to her. Y’ know, the three
remaining?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Yes, Ma’am, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: It’s flatterin’ you showin’ me how you’ve
turned into such a competent reporter and all. But even if I remembered
where I sent ’em. I couldn’t tell ya.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Professional ethics.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Only you. Could do this.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: You fed him. You gave him clothes. You’re the
first human ever was kind to him…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Accordingly. You’re sick with guilt.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: You sure you’re not a complex guy?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: So if y’called around. Musta found
somepla…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I can’t put him there, til I go down to
St. John’s. See it’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Great! Let’s not be rash!</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I mean, the kids could stay with</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Why. Would I. Do that?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well. Remember when you said. Someday, I’d
do something nice for you?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Hey. Overnight trip to St. John’s. All
expenses paid.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: What’s wrong with a weekend?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Now, listen to this for t’morrow. After I
sign the papers at the home…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Or we could sleep in.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I just feel so guilty about all your
expenses. Two separate rooms. Both so big.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Hey, it’s my treat. You agreed.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Still. Seems like we could figure out.
Something.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: A friend told me once. Love is the only
thing that counts.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: So when you told me how you think about your
husband. I really understood, becau…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: That’s what I wanted us to talk abou…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: …because real love. Just comes once.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: See, you know some of the stories about
Petal. Some of the bad things. What you don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Even tho. She never loved you.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Sorta. Because of it.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: See, love. Isn’t about what’s good for you.
Isn’t about what you wish it was. Isn’t about what…would make you
happy.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Love. Is about want. What you really want.
And you can’t change that. Even if it’s poison.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: So that’s why it’s great. To have a real
friend. When you’re. Lonely.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I know you have to stay tomorrow. To sign the
papers. But.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I should be heading back. Before Herry.
Misses me. Too much.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: And I’m not feeling so well. What I get for
mixing vodka and beer, huh.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: So I’ll grab a taxi. You stay and finish.
Listen to the music. Is</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I cou…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: And don’t worry. I’m still your friend.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: She did stay my friend. In her way. Even
tho, for awhile, we didn’t see each other a lot.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Funny. How one little talk. Can change
everything.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Tell me about it. Just get the aunt’s house
fixed perfect, and I gotta move.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Three hours to drive from the Point, with
all the ice. Alvin won’t have my boat ready til New Years. Agnis can
stay over her shop. Bunny and I have to find a room in town.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: Stay with us. My kid follows yours around,
they’ll bunk t’gether. And we gotta fluffy couch that’s more’n you
deserve.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: It’s two years. My boat’s ready. If I stay
any longer, I’ll begin to like it here.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Last friend left me. Turned into a truck
driver.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: Well. With that warning.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: What’s the barrel for?</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: I’m British. I bathe.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Perfect for th’ chips.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: It’s coated with two kinds of scum. Soap.
And mine.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Works. We forgot to buy dip.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Feeling that and more. What’s the
situation?</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: One. You’re moving in with Dennis, no
matter how fond you are of his wife.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m some disgusted. With the human race.</p>
<p><strong>nutbeem</strong>: I’da never made it, anyway. Storms would
have blown me to bits. You boys saved my life. Yes, you did.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hands might as well be movin’ while we chat.
Always hated th’ sight a grown men around a table workin’ nuthin’ but
their jaws.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Editorial meetin’, y’say. ’Bout what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, Tert Card’s gone, fer one thing.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yar, I know, he never said g’bye. Well, don’t
get all weepy-eyed about it, old son. Try t’be a man.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They called him from St. John’s, he tells me.
Wants him to help put out th’ newsletter fer them oil rig suppliers.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He was sassy an’ he was smug. Oh, there’s a
waitin’ list, he assures me. They only skims th’ cream.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well, don’t get all weepy-eyed abou…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Truth t’tell. I was a wee help. B’hind the
scenes, doncha know.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well, Billy’ll do a helluva job…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Spot I’m in, Christmas and all. Might have to
offer th’mess. To you.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Course. I’d need a raise.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Y’know. Yer do have the sense God gave a
doughnut.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Any other outrageous demands? Seein’ as yer
got me over a barrel. Here’s your one chance.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well, your son…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You were sayin’…?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: His whole life would be changed. If he could
come upon. A fishing license.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, there’s only one a those issued per
family. So how exactly would he do that?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Even doughnuts, y’know. Can push their
luck.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Uh. I didn’t. Most of these</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: There’s two. Are yours.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You prob’ly want to wait for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Oh, I’m much too excited.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: It’s from a museum catalogue. But it’s not
real. It’s a copy.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: It’s nice for your eyes. I thought.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: It’s for everyday. You don’t have to save it
for special.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Oh, I’ll save this, all right.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: And I’ll think of you. When I</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I don’t make mistakes. About that kind of
thing.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: It was so big, I thought it was a tea cozy
for your car. But if it’s for me, it has to be bigger, huh?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Well. You’ll grow into it.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You kiddin’? After the holidays, we’ll have
to stretch it.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Not used to a woman. Giving me presents.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: One Christmas with Petal, I gave her eleven
things. And I wrapped them. And watched her open them up.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: She didn’t have anything for me. Like every
year. But this one time, she said, ‘Wait a minute.’</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: She ran to the kitchen. I heard the fridge
open. She came back. With her hands hidden behind her. Then, she held
out…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Two brown eggs. She gave them to me from her
own hands. They were cold.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Must sound really stupid. But they meant a
lot to me.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Well. It’s the thought that counts.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I broke ’em, careful. Made her an omelette
with ’em. And I saved the shells. In a little box.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Oh, yeh. They’re on a shelf behind my desk.
At the paper.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I know how it is. To hold onto something
good. In the middle of all the bad.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well. I gotta collect Bunny. Beety’s gonna
have supper waiting.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Thank you. Thank you, very much.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well. Merry Christmas!</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Merry Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>principal</strong>: Your friends and neighbors, and most of
all, your children. Have</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: We all know Billy Pretty’s ways. Never save
fifty cents, if you can save a dollar.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Well, last Feb’ry, Billy wants t’get his
grandfather clock repaired. Calls old Leander Mesher. Local call. No
charge.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Well, says Leander, the big cost is pickup
and delivery. Got t’charge fifty dollars, each way. Two strong boys.
Gasoline. Air in the tires!</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: There’s no cost for air in yer tires!, says
Bill. Get wi’ th’times, he’s told. Tis called inflation!</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Billy lives at the top of the hill, Leander
at the bot tom, doncha know. So Billy gets a rope, HOISTS the
grandfather UP on his back. And muttering the words fifty bucks…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Mite slick. Four feet thick a ice.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Meanwhile, at the bottom, Auntie Fizzard, 91
years young, sets out in her non-slip galoshes and her cane with the
rubber tip. Didn’t yer, dearie?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Meanwhile, at the top…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: …OVER he goes, clock-side down, and PICKIN’
UP SPEED!</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: …eight blocks, NINE, missing everything like
a miracle, zeroing in on…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: CLIPS ’er inta the snow bank!</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Just two galoshes stickin’ outta the snow.
She digs ’er way out. Brushes herself off. Looks at him sprawled like a
turtle on his back, tied to his massive burden. She says…</p>
<p><strong>herold</strong>: I shoulda come last night. Seen the
show.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Woulda been a thrill for the Christians
among’ em. They think you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>herold</strong>: Well, then we got good news for th…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: So does your son.</p>
<p><strong>herold</strong>: Even better news for him.</p>
<p><strong>herold</strong>: There’s a million reasons to send me away.
Good ones. And only two reasons not to.</p>
<p><strong>herold</strong>: I love you. And you love me.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: We get so little mention in the wires.
Thought you’d like to see.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Head in the suitcase. The mystery’s
solved.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Silver Melville was captured in Moored with
a cruise steward. The boy was twenty, a looker, wearing Armani clothes.
Driving a nice Lexus.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Says she did it all for love.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: She’d call me, time to time. Husband was a
pig. More women should do what she done. Her situation.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Some women. Shoulda done it to their
brother.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Mavis said you buried Warren here. Called it
an anniversary.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Of a loss. But not the dog.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: What makes us do that, nephew? Give ourselves
away to someone. So we can’t eat or think or breathe without ’em?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Wonderful, ain’t it?</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Irene Warren died. The mornin’ after a
Christmas. We get one true love in life, nephew. She was mine.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Don’t mean we can’t give love again. And get
some back.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: For some, it does.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: And if that ruffles some small town
feathers…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Y’know what the feathers around here need
th’ most? A good ruffling, I say.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Y’know what I need th’ most?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: A really big breakfast!</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Hey. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: It was easy. I just kept thinkin’. How would
Petal do it?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: We’re friends, right? Friends drink
together.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I asked a quest…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Not drunk enough yet to talk about Petal.
Which we always seem to do.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Let’s talk about me. Which we don’t.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Growin’ up, all I wanted from this place was
out. Imagine. Give up all this.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I ran off to Toronto, went to school. Wanted
to be a social worker. For kids.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Came back one summer. Fell for Herold Prowse.
That. Was that.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Did you know I was a liar?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Herold liked other women. But you know how
that is.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: See, I’m a good liar.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: He ran off to Seattle with some bitch. When
his damaged son was two months old. And nobody knew.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Like I said. It’s four years ago. And it’s
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: So I took his boat out. I sunk it. And told
my little story. Grieving widow.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I was leaving, of course. Why humiliate
myself on the wayout?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: All these funny, odd little folks? They put
their hearts around me. So I wouldn’t be alone. Having lost the man I
loved.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: And since I knew, to my shame, that is
exactly what I had lost. I let go of the will to leave. I did.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Decided to let my child grow up. Around folks
better than his mom.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: You’re quite the talker.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Well, this morning. The man I loved. Came
back.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Told me he knew. I loved him still.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Okay. Now I’m drunk enough. To talk about
Petal.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: You’re thinking we’re kindred souls, you and
me. In love with our nightmares.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: You don’t love your Petal. You hate. Her
cheating. Guts.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: You have to think it’s love. Because if it’s
not, you’re dead inside. So you keep that flame a flickering. Cos it’s
all you’ll ever have.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: You see. You’re a good liar, too.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Where’s the damn eggshells? That’s all I came
to see.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Can you guess how I know about Petal?</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Because you and I. Are kindred souls. After
all.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: So I told my husband. To fuck himself. And
the ego he rode in on.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Thanks for the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: If I don’t see you. Happy New Year.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I think they’re all here.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: They’re beautiful. I never saw ’em. All
together.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Will she be proud to wear ’em?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Well. Any woman would.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What is this? Suicide attempt?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Gotta paint the name. What’ll it be? ‘The
Tall And Quiet Woman’?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You knew Billy’s dad?</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Ever’body knows ever’body. But Billy’s pap
didn’t invent the Four Women in a Man’s Life.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Well. Which one is Bunny, I wonder? The Maid
in the Meadow, mebbe.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: Doncha know? They’re all the same woman.
That’s the point.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: The Maid in the Meadow, that’s her innocence
and play. The Stouthearted Woman, is when you need to lean on her.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: The Tall and Quiet Woman? That’s the silent
partner who always walks ’longside, so’s yer never alone.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: And the Demon Lover. That’s just the frostin’
on th’ cake.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: When y’find the woman who’s all four? That’s
when y’got yer one true love.</p>
<p><strong>alvin</strong>: …like m’Gertie.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: My dad went over the side this mornin’.
Tangled in th’ sling- stone line.</p>
<p><strong>dennis</strong>: If you could write a memorial t’ him. Fer
t’morrow’s Gammy Bird? I’d be real grateful.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: Happy New Year, Mr. Quoyle. I’m sorry I missed
you at the pageant.</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I was in the wings, a course. Wasn’t our girl
somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>dawn</strong>: I say, y’have t’love a woman. Who’s in touch
with her inner chicken.</p>
<p><strong>agnis</strong>: Nephew. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: He’s okay. He’s not sleeping in the box.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Remember what I told you.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: If he’s not sleeping. Why do they call it a
awake?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: We’re the ones have to be awake. To how much
we love him…</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: And how we should be good to each other.
While we have the chance.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: He looks like he’s sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That’s cos he’s peaceful. No worries,
anymore. No troubles.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: I found this in Jack’s drawer at the paper.
I don’t know if it’s somethin’ special…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. buggit</strong>: Oh, it’s his lodge pin. We were lookin’

<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: New Year’s present.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Oh, yeh. It’s a Quoyle tradition.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Thanks. For the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: See. He woke up.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: That’s a funny thing to say. For the first
thing he said.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: What? ‘I’m keepin’ m’damn lobster
license’?</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Maybe he just said it. To make your Uncle
Dennis laugh so hard. You think?</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Well. The world’s not fair. You said.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: That’s something the world is always
teaching us. And sometimes, the learning comes later.</p>

main stem of this boat. It gives us our shape.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: See, I know why you saved a place for Petal.
All this time.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Cos I’m the daddy. And you learn how to do.
By watching me.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: You just watched. Better than I knew.</p>
<p><strong>quoyle</strong>: Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: I’m thanking your daddy. For all my
presents.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: There was only two.</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: More than two. Everything I need. Except…</p>
<p><strong>wavey</strong>: Except a necklace.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: I got a box of ’em. You could pick one.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: Then you’d have everything you need.</p>
<p><strong>bunny</strong>: No.</p>
