Whistle some more.</p>

<p><strong>superimpose title</strong>: “REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE” STARRING
____ as siren rises piercingly close, and JIM looks up, we:</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Mixed up in that beating on Twelfth
Street?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: No. Plain drunkenness.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: This says he was picked up there.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: They had him on the carpet for an hour at
Headquarters. He’s clear. Plain drunkenness.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Young squirt. All right–You want to lean
him against something? Stand him over there.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You going to tell me your name now?</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Where’s your hair?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: It’s all gone.</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Did you get a haircut?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: No–it just fell out!</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Aw–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What gang does he belong to?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Give him a couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Where’s your mamma, honey?</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Judy–we’re ready for you now.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: He hates me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: He hates me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What makes you think he hates you, Judy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t think. I know. He looks at me like I’m
the ugliest thing in the world. He doesn’t like my friends–he–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: He doesn’t like anything about me– he calls
me–he calls me–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He makes you feel pretty unhappy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: He calls me a dirty tramp–my own father!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Do you think your father means that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes! I don’t know! I mean maybe he doesn’t
mean it but he acts like he does. We’re altogether and we’re going to
celebrate Easter and catch a double bill. Big deal. So I put on my new
dress and I came out and he–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That one?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes–he started yelling for a
handkerchief–screaming. He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick
off–he rubbed till I thought I wouldn’t have any lips left. And all the
time yelling at me–that thing–the thing I told you he called me. Then I
ran out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is that why you were wandering around at one
o’clock in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I was just talking a walk. I tried to call the
kids but everybody was out and I couldn’t find them. I hate my life. I
just hate it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You weren’t looking for company, were you?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy? Do you
enjoy that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No. I don’t even know why I do it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Do you think you can get back at your Dad that
way? I mean sometimes if we can’t get as close to somebody as we’d like
we have to try making them jealous–so they’ll have to pay attention. Did
you ever think of that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’ll never get close to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street,
Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You know where they picked me up! Twelfth
Street! I wasn’t even near there!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Would you like to go home if we can arrange it?
Did you notify the parents?</p>
<p><strong>woman officer</strong>: She wouldn’t give me their
number.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s your number, Judy? We’ll see if your Dad
will come and get you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Unless you really don’t want to go home. Would
you rather stay here?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Lexington 05549.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Hey! That’s enough static out of you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Want me to imitate a stupid cop?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Cut it out now. I’m warning you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: You shivering, John? You cold?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Want my jacket?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You want my jacket? It’s warm.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Your mother will be down in a few minutes,
Judy–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Your mother will be down in a few minutes.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: My mother?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: She’s being called for.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You said you’d call my father.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Goodbye, Judy. Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: John Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Come with me, John.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Jim!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Happy Easter.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Where were you tonight? They called us at
the club and I got the fright of my life!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Where were you tonight, Jimbo?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You think I’m funny?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why didn’t you take my jacket?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Do you know why you shot those puppies, John?
Is that what they call you or do you have a nickname?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Plato.</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: You talk to the man nice now, hear?
He’s going to help you.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Nobody can help me.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Can you tell me why you killed the puppies,
Plato?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: No, sir. I just went next door to look at
them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it. I
guess I’m just no good?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: What do you think’s going to happen, you do
things like that?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I don’t know. End up in the electric
chair?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Where did you get the gun?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: In my mother’s drawer.</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: She keep it to protect herself, sir.
She scared without a man in the house.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Where’s your mother tonight, Plato?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: She’s away.</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: Seems like she’s always going
somewhere. She got a sister in Chicago and she go for the holiday. She
says her sister is all the family she has.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Where’s your father?</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: They not together, sir. We don’t see
him in a long time now.</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Do you hear from him, son?</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: You know if the boy ever talked to a
psychiatrist?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Head-shrinker?</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Crawford don’t believe in
them!</p>
<p><strong>gene</strong>: Well maybe she better start.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I don’t see what’s so bad about taking a
little drink.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You don’t?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No. I definitely don’t. I did the sa–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’s a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me
like he had more than a little drink.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Say, listen–</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Jim–don’t hum.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I guess I cut pretty loose in my day
too.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Really, Frank? When was that?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Listen–can’t you wait till we get home?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Whoa! Whoa! I know you’re a little upset
but–</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What about you, Jim? Got anything to say for
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Not interested, huh?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Can’t you answer? What’s the matter with you
anyhow?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: He’s just loaded, honey.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I was talking to Jim.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Let me just explain to you–we just moved
here, y’understand? The kid has no friends yet and–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Tell him why we moved here.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Hold it, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You can’t protect me.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You mind if I try? You have to slam the door
in my face? I try to get to him–what happens? Don’t I give you
everything you want? A bicycle–you get a bicycle. A car–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You buy me many things. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Not just buy! You hear all this talk about
not lovely your kids enough. We give you love and affection, don’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Then what is it? I can’t even touch you
anymore but you pull away. I want to understand you. Why’d you get
drunk? You must have had a reason.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Was it because we went to that party? You
know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into– it’s no place
for kids.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: A minute ago you said you didn’t care if he
drinks.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: He said a little drink.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’re tearing me apart!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Stop tearing me apart! You say one thing and he
says another and then everybody changes back–</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: That’s a fine way to behave!</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: Well you know who he takes after!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Outside, Jim. Come outside.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Excuse us a minute?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Sure. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Someone should put poison in her epsom
salts.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Grandma?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Get lost.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hang loose, boy. I’m warning you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wash up and go home.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Big tough character. You don’t kid me, pal. How
come you’re not wearing your boots?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Too bad you didn’t connect. You could have gone
to Juvenile Hall. That’s what you want, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sure it is. You want to bug us till we have to
lock you up. Why?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t know why–!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Go on–don’t give me that. Someone giving you
hard looks?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I just get so– Boy, sometimes the temperature
goes way up.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay. Okay. Let it out.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You feel like you want to blow your wheels
right now?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: All the time! I don’t know what gets into
me–but I keep looking for trouble and I always–I swear you better lock
me up. I’m going to smash somebody–I know it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Try the desk.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That why you moved from the last town? ’Cause
you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to–I know about
it anyway. Routine check.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And they think they are protecting my by
moving.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You were getting a good start in the wrong
direction back there. Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mess that kid up?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: He called me chicken.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: And your folks didn’t understand?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: They never do.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So then you moved?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: They think I’ll make friends if we move. Just
move and everything’ll be roses and sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: But you don’t think that’s a solution.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Things pretty tough for you at home?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: She eats him alive and he takes it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What a zoo!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: A zoo. He always wants to be my pal, you know?
But how can I give him anything when he’s–I mean I love him and I don’t
want to hurt him–but I don’t know what to do anymore except maybe
die.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Pretty mixed up?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: If he could–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: “If he could” what? You mean your father?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold
once I bet she’d be happy and I bet she’d stop picking. They make mush
out of him. Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like
him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Chicken?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I bet you see right through me, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How can anyone grow up in this circus?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You got me, Jim–but they do. Want some
water?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Boy–if I had one day when I didn’t have to be
all confused and ashamed of everything–or I felt I belonged some
place.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Here. Look, will you do something for me? If
the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get
yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk–come in and shoot the
breeze. It’s easier sometimes than talking to your folks.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Okay–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Any time–day or night. You calmed down enough
to go back now?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You serious?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: All right, darling.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: This was all very unfortunate, but he made
a mistake and he’s sorry– so we’re not going to have any more trouble.
He’s always been a lovely boy–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Lovely! Grandma–if you tell another lie you’re
going to turn to stone.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Luck, Jim. Don’t forget.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Have some cigars.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No thanks, I don’t smoke.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Go on–Give ’em to your friends.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No–thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Frank–he doesn’t want any.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Beau!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What are you trying to do, get yourself
killed?</p>
<p><strong>beau</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Your eggs are on the table, dear.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Sit down and eat–you’ll be late.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’d stick in my throat, Mom. I’m nervous or
something–</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: It’s a wonder we don’t all have TB or some
other terrible disease after living in all those smokey cities!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, drink your milk anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: There aren’t so many factories here.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Mother–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You make any sandwiches?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: My first day of school, mother’d make me eat
and by golly I could never even swallow till recess–</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: There’s nothing to be nervous about. Here’s
peanut butter and meat loaf–</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: What did I tell you? Peanut butter!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, there’s a thermos of orange juice and
some apple-sauce cake in the wax paper to wash it down.</p>
<p><strong>grandma</strong>: I baked that!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: ’Bye, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Goodbye, dear.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: So long, young fella. Knock ’em dead, like
your old man used to!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sure– You know something? I have a feeling
we’re going to stay here.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: And listen–watch out about the pals you
choose–Know what I mean? Don’t let them choose you–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Come out of the alley, Beau! This is the last
time I’m going to call you.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Beau! All right–go to school alone!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey, didn’t I see you before some place?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hi. I saw you before.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Bully for you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You don’t have to be unfriendly.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Now that’s true!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: “Life is crushing in on me.”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: “Life can be beautiful.” Hey, I know where it
was.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Where what was.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where I saw you. Everything going okay now? You
live around here?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Who lives?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: See, I’m new.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Won’t mother be proud.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’re really flipped–aren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where’s Dawson High School?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You going there?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah–why–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Dig the square wardrobe!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah. So where’s the high school?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: University and 10th–Want to carry my
books?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I was just getting my car. I could take
you.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: The kids take me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’ll bet you’re a real yo yo.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Goodbye! See you!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Stella-a-a-a!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Steady Marlon!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Wanna make the colored lights go around and
around?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: A new disease.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m glad they let you out.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Nobody chickened.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I heard about it. You’re lucky he lived.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: They always live.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where’s University and 10th?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: That way!</p>
<p><strong>chick</strong>: That way!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: That way!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hi–can you tell we where I go? I’m just
starting here.</p>
<p><strong>monitor</strong>: Mr. Bassett’s office–203. He’ll tell you
where your home room is–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: You remember me?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No. I don’t think so–</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I’m sorry–I made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: For many days before the end of our earth
people will look into the night sky and notice a star, increasingly
bright and increasingly near.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: As this star approaches us, the weather
will change. The great polar fields of the north and south will rot and
divide, and the seas will turn warmer.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: The last of us search the heavens and
stand amazed. For the stars will still be there, moving through their
ancient rhythms.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: The familiar constellations that
illuminate our night will seem as they have always seemed, eternal,
unchanged and little moved by the shortness of time between our planet’s
birth and its demise.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Orion, the Hunter.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Boy!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Once you been up there, you know you been some
place!</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Gemini, the Twins.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Cancer, the Crab.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: I’m a crab!</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Taurus, the Bull.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Moo!</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Yeah, moo.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Moo. That’s real cute. Moo.</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: Hey, he’s real rough–</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: I bet he fights with cows.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Moo.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Sagittarius and Aries–all as they have
ever been.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: You shouldn’t monkey with him.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: He’s a wheel. So’s she. It’s hard to make
friends with them.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t want to make friends.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: And while the flash of our beginning has
not yet traveled the light years into distance–</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Has not yet been seen by planets deep
within the other galaxies, we will disappear into the blackness of the
space from which we came.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Destroyed as we began in a burst of gas
and fire.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: The heavens are still and cold once more.
In all the complexity of our universe and the galaxies beyond, the Earth
will not be missed.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Through the infinite reaches of space, the
problems of Man seem trivial and naive indeed. And Man, existing alone,
seems to be an episode of little consequences.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: That’s all. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey, it’s over. The world ended.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: What does he know about Man alone?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: May I have your attention? May I please
have your attention? Classes will meet at the busses outside. May I have
your attention? The heck with it.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Excuse me. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>male teacher</strong>: John, where you going?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I forgot something. I’ll get a hitch.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: What’s your name!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jim. What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Plato. It’s a nickname.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Listen, I told you not to fool with them. Now
they’re waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know. That’s why I came back.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: You scared?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I just don’t want trouble.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: He has a knife.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I saw it. Gee, look at that thing swing, will
you? Do you think it never stops?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: No. It’s perpetual motion.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at
night and pushes it. Go- go-go!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Jim?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: They’re still there!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Jim–Do you think when the end of the world
comes it’ll be at night?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No. In the morning.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I just have a feeling.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: If you don’t want trouble, I know a place we
can go–</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: It’s a big mansion and we could sneak around
there and they wouldn’t even know. You could be safe–</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Should we go?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The shadows are getting long.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Le soleil tombe dans la mer.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You know something?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You watch too much television.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Hey, he’s real abstract and different.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m cute, too.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Meaning me?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Chicken?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You shouldn’t call me that.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You always at ringside? You always travel in
this rank company?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I thought only punks fought with knives.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Who’s fighting? This is the test, man. It’s a
crazy game.</p>
<p><strong>helen</strong>: Les jeux de courage!</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Machismo. Machismo.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Machismo?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Somebody find him a knife.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Jim!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: You know the action? No cutting. Just
sticking–jab real cool.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What you waiting on, Toreador? I thought you
wanted some action!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Big brave bull. Hah! Toro! Hah! Hah!</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: Moo!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Come on–Fascinate us. Impress us. What’s
happening? Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t want trouble.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: You crud chicken! You’re wasting our time!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Yeah–that’s pretty close. How about a little
closer, Toreador? Cut off a button and you get to join the club!</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Mr. Minton! Mr. Minton! Trouble!</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Look. There’s your audience.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Oh, I don’t think so. From the school?</p>
<p><strong>group</strong>: Ole! Ole!</p>
<p><strong>mil</strong>: Buzzy! Look out! He’s got a chain!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Hey! Chicken Little!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: All right–you want it, you got it!</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Honk. Let’s split.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Split for what? Couple old poopheads?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You satisfied or you want more?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: How ’bout you? Say the word and you’re cold,
Jack–you’re dead.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Buzzie–we better get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What’s eating you, Judy? You want him
alive?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where can we meet?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Know the Millertown bluff?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: The bluff, Buzz! That’s dangerous up
there.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Draw him a picture, Chicken Little. Eight
o’clock. Cookie, you call Moose and get a couple cars. We’re going to
have us some real kicks. Little chickie-run. You been on chickie-runs
before?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sure–that’s all I do.</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: All right–all of you–start moving!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You mean l’il ol’ us? What’s the matter with
the nice man?</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Don’t clown with me.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Why’nt you go suck on something sweet?</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: You think you’re tough? I got a son twice
your size and I can still handle him.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Don’t lose control, Mr. Jamison. I think
if we just explain–</p>
<p><strong>guide</strong>: Explain to these? They think they own the
world!</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: The world is round!</p>
<p><strong>mil</strong>: The world is flat!</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: All the world’s a stage!</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: The world goes round the sun! Goodbye proud
world! I got the world on a string! The world’s my oyster! Hey! A
fish-eater! Brain food.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: Sometimes the world is too much with us,
isn’t it, son? What was the disturbance?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lecturer</strong>: You’re bleeding. Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I scratched my mosquito bites. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m fine–thanks!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Are you really going to meet them?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Who knows. Plato?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What’s a chickie-run?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Hiya, Jimbo.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You thought I was Mom?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: It’s just this get-up. The girl’s out and I
was bringing Mom’s supper.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And you dropped it?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Yeah! Shh!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s funny!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I better clean this up before she sees
it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let her see. What could happen.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dad–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dad–don’t. Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Time now for the seven o’clock news.
Friends, the next time you go shopping.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: What are you wishing for, Judy?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I wasn’t wishing. I was looking at the
moon.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: “Man in the Moon, how came you there–
Up in the sky where you are shining– Floating so high in the frosty
air–? Oh, say–Man in the Moon!”–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: We used to sing it in school. Don’t
look at me with such horror. They had schools in those days.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: But the same song. I think it’s fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: We were romantic then too–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Are you and Mom home tonight?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Nothing, only it’d be nice to spend an evening
together for a change.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: With us old creeps? Come on, we have
to eat.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Daddy–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Didn’t you forget something?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: What’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: You’re too old for that kind of
stuff, kiddo. I thought you stopped doing that long ago.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I didn’t want to stop.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s mother</strong>: Didn’t want to stop what?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I was talking to Dad.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: I didn’t kiss her so it’s a big
thing.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s mother</strong>: Bertha! You can serve the souffle!
Fish souffle. You don’t have to stand there, darling. Drink your tomato
juice.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I guess I just don’t understand anything.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: I’m tired, Judy. I’d like to change
the subject.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: I’d like to, that’s all. Girls your
age don’t do that. You need an explanation?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Girls don’t love their father? Since when?
Since I got to be sixteen?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: Stop it now! Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: Hi, rascal.</p>
<p><strong>beau</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: May I please be excused?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: Hey, hey, Glamorpuss. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: I don’t know what to do. All of a
sudden she’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s mother</strong>: She’ll outgrow it, dear. It’s just
the age.</p>
<p><strong>beau</strong>: The atomic age!</p>
<p><strong>judy’s mother</strong>: It’s the age when nothing fits.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You awake?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Listen–I took a steak out of the freezer. I
thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party–just the two of
us, what do you say?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey–I want to ask you something.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Shoot, Jimbo.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Suppose you knew that you had to do something
very dangerous–where you have to prove something you need to know–a
question of honor. Would you do it?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Is there some kind of trick answer?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What would you do, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I wouldn’t do anything hasty. Let’s get a
little light on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Blood.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: How’d that happen! What kind of trouble you
in?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The kind we’ve been talking about. Can you
answer me now?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Listen–nobody should make a snap
decision–This isn’t something you just–we ought to consider all the pros
and cons–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We don’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: We’ll make time. Where’s some paper. We’ll
make a list and if we’re still stuck then we ought to get some
advice–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What can you do when you have to be a man?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Well, now–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Just give me a direct answer! You going to stop
me from going, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You know I never stop you from anything.
Believe me–you’re at a wonderful age. In ten years you’ll look back on
this and wish you were a kid again.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ten years? Now, Dad–I need an answer now!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I just want to show you how foolish you are.
When you’re older you’ll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so
important–</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Jim? Will you listen? You can’t go out till
we–Jim!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Jim? Jim!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Hey, Chicken-Little.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Where’s Toreador? He beg off?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: He’s not scared of you.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Yeah? Goon! You seen that adolescent type
anywheres?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: He won’t show.</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: Well, you going to wait all night? I’m getting
nervous, man! We got to do something!</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Hey, Buzz!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cookie</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How’d you get here?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I hitched.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Boy, I bet you’d go to a hanging.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: My personality’s showing again. Should I
leave?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Come on. Let’s see what we’re driving.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Just him.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Stay there.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What you say your name was?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jim Stark.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Buzz Gundersen.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Glad to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: Got some goodies for you, Buzzie-boy.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Flashlight?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Looks good.</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: Clean as a whistle. They both got plenty
breeze.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Look good to you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sure. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Is he your friend?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Yes. My best friend.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: What’s he like?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Oh, I don’t know. You have to get to know
him. He doesn’t say much but when he does you know he means it. He’s
sincere.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Well, that’s the main thing–don’t you think
so?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Maybe next summer he’s going to take me
hunting with him–and fishing. I want him to teach me how and I bet he
won’t get mad if I goof. His name’s Jim. It’s really James but he likes
Jim more. People he really likes–he lets call him “Jamie.”</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Want to finish my hamburger? I only took a
bite.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Better try the doors. Jump out.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: No–quick, man! You got to break quick.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: This is the edge, boy. This is the end.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: I like you, you know?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Buzz? What are we doing this for?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: We got to do something. Don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Feel okay?</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Give me some dirt.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Hey, Toreador! She signals. We head for the
edge. The first guy who jumps–chicken!</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Good luck, Buzz.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Judy.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>buzz</strong>: Hit your lights!</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where’s Buzz! Where’s Buzz!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Jim! Jim!</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Down there! Down there is Buzz!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Come on, Jim! We got to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Get up! Get up! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Go on! Move!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: This is fine–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Judy. Will you be okay?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I got to go in. You better get home too.
Hey–what?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Why don’t you come home with me? I mean
nobody’s home at my house–and I’m not tired, are you? I don’t have
many–people I can talk to.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Who has?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: If you want to come we could talk and then in
the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to– Gee…if you
could only have been my father…we could…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey…you flipped–or something? You better take
off…</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: O.K. G’night. I got to pick up my scooter.
See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>beau</strong>: Hello, little cute sister.</p>
<p><strong>beau</strong>: Hello, darling, baby-pie, glamor- puss,
sweetie–</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: Beau! You belong in bed!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He’s home! You’re home! You’re all
right!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What happened, darling. We were so worried.
I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn’t till I knew you were
home.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I have to talk to someone, Mom. I have to talk
to you both. And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m in terrible trouble.–You know that big high
bluff near Miller- town Junction?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Sure–there was a bad accident there. They
showed the pictures on</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I was in it.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: How!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It doesn’t matter how. I was driving a stolen
car–</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Do you enjoy doing this to me or what–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mom–I’m not–</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: And you wanted him to make a list!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Will you let him tell it!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: She never wants to hear. She doesn’t care!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I guess when I nearly died giving birth to
you–that shows how much I don’t care!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Just relax, please relax!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I told you Dad, it was a question of honor.
They called me chicken– you know, chicken! I had to go or I would never
have been able to face any of those kids again. So I got in one of these
cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other. We had to drive fast and
jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff. I got out okay but
Buzz didn’t. He was killed.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Good Lord!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I can’t keep it to myself anymore–</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Well, just get it off your chest, son.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s not what I mean. I’ve never done
anything right. I’ve been going around with my head in a sling for
years…I don’t want to drag you into this but I can’t help it. I don’t
think I can prove anything by going around pretending I’m tough any
more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like
another.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You’re absolutely right!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Are you listening to me? You’re involved in
this! I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this
thing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You what?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Did anyone see you there? I mean did they
get your license number or anything?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t think so–</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Well–</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: What about the other boys–Do you think
they’ll go to the police?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What’s that got to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Why should you be the only one.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Look Jim. Far be it from me to tell you what
to do, but there’s–</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Are you going to preach now? Are we going to
have a sermon?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I’m just explaining what you mean! You can’t
be an idealist all your life! Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck
out!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: That’s right!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Except yourself!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Will you wait a minute?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You don’t want me to go.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: No! I don’t want you to go to the police!
There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But I am involved! We’re all involved, Mom! A
boy was killed! I don’t see how we can get out of that by pretending it
didn’t happen!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You know you did wrong. That’s the main
thing, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No! It’s nothing! Just nothing! You always told
me to tell the truth. You think you can just turn that off?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: He’s not saying that! He’s saying don’t
volunteer!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Just tell a little white lie?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You’ll learn as you get a little older,
Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t want to learn that!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well, it doesn’t matter anyhow– because
we’re moving.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No! You’re not tearing me loose any more.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Do I have to spell it out?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’re not going to use me as an excuse again,
Mom. Every time you can’t face yourself you want to move and you say
it’s because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse. Now I
want to do one thing right and I’m not letting you run away. Dad?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Son–this is all happening so fast–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You better give me something, Dad. You better
give me something Mom?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Jimmy, you’re very young–and a foolish
decision now could wreck your whole life.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dad–answer her–aren’t you going to stand up for
me?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Stop it! You’ll kill him! Jim! Do you want
to kill your father?</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: Let go of me–</p>
<p><strong>moose’s father</strong>: You want a good crack in the
mouth?</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: This place appeal to you or something?</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: What’s he going to pull–</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: Nothing, Crunch. They picked him up like the
rest of–</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: You see any cops?</p>
<p><strong>moose’s father</strong>: You monsters start home. We’re going
to–</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>moose’s father</strong>: We’re following you so better get
there.</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: You see any cops?</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: No–</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: He’s going to cheese, I tell you. Nobody
arrested him!</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: I think I should go home.</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: No. We’re going to bring him down.</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: Crunch–my father’s–You going to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: You clean out of your head? Come on!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: W-O-J-T-what?</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: O-W-I-C-Z. Wojtowicz. What’s the matter,
man? That’s the craziest name in town! It swings!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Excuse me–but–You know where I can find–I mean
I don’t remember his last name–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Look–can’t you see I’m writing?</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: Man, this cat never stops. He just keeps
going like Big Jay at a session!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>hoodlum</strong>: He’s writing a book about me–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What I could write about you they wouldn’t
print.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I think his first name’s Ray–I have to see him.
It’s very important.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: What’s the charge?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Listen–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: He’s not here. He’s not at Juvenile Hall.
I don’t know where he is. He’s out on a call and he’ll be out all night.
How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: My parents know I’m out. They know I’m
here.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Come back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ll wait for him.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant</strong>: Why don’t you come back tomorrow, son?
Ever been booked before?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: Who wants her? Who? Jim who? Never
heard of you.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: What do you want!</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: You know what we want. We want your
friend.</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: We got eyes for him.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Listen, you guys ought to go home. The cops
are cruising every–</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: Where does he live?</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: You better tell us and I’m not kidding.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: My old man’s got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: His old man’s got a gun. What do you think of
that! Your friend talked– Now you talk! Talk!</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: What you doing! What you doing to him!
You clear out of here ’fore I call the police!</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: Clear out. Go on! Go on now!</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: Let’s go, Crunch.</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: Why you like to mix with bad boys like
that? Why you get in trouble all the–</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I have to go out. I have to warn him.</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: You not going anywhere! You staying
home while your mama’s away.</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: John! What you doing with that! You
leave that be! Put it down before you hurt yourself. Hear me?</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: John! You stay home! John! John!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Coming up now another request–this time
from the boys down at Anna’s Pizza Paradise–A new arrangement of a great
oldie in rhythm and blues. Jim, this is dedicated to you–from Buzz.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: They’ll be looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: They saw where I jumped! I didn’t chicken! What
do I have to do– kill myself?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It doesn’t matter to them.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You were looking for me, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No–I was just–maybe–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I tried to call you before.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I thought so.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Want some milk?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s all I can do when I’m nervous. Drink
milk. Here–have a slug.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You still pretty upset?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m numb.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You cold?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Even if I’m near a fire, I’m cold. I guess
just about everybody’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto
somebody! Judy, what am I going to do? I can’t go home again.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Neither can I.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No? Why not? You know something? Sometimes I
figure I’ll never live to see my next birthday. Isn’t that dumb?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Every day I look in the mirror and say, “What?
You still here?” Man!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey! You smiled!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Like even today. I woke up this morning, you
know? And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first
thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one
terrific day so you better live it up, boy, ’cause tomorrow maybe you’ll
be nothing.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m sorry I treated you mean today. You
shouldn’t believe what I say when I’m with the kids. Nobody acts
sincere.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why’d you get mixed up with them? You don’t
have to prove anything.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: If you knew me you wouldn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t think you trust anybody, do you?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m getting that way, too.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Have you ever gone with anyone who–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sure. Lots of times.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So have I. But I’ve never been in love. Isn’t
that awful?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Awful? No. It’s just lonely. It’s the loneliest
time.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I felt like it.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Your lips are soft when you kiss.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know, but we can’t stay here.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where can we go? I can’t go back into that
zoo.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I’m never going back.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Listen! I know a place! PLATO showed me before.
An old deserted mansion near the planetarium Would you go with me?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You can trust me, Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I feel as if I’m walking under water.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Frank? I’m frightened.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What’s that pounding?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I don’t know. First I thought it was Jim
but–</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: He’s home. I heard the car.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Are you going down there?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Look–just relax, will you?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: See? It stopped.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I still think you should go down.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Who’s there? Anyone there?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Who’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Where’s your son?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>another voice</strong>: Where’s your baby boy gone to, Daddy?
We want him.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Look in his room!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Jim! Jim!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Son?</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: Is anything wrong? I’m your
neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Oh, no, thanks. I just wanted to– to be sure
my garage was closed.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Is he there?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: No, honey. No, he’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>judy’s father</strong>: Judy?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Where’s Jim?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I don’t know. Do you–do you know where he
is?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: No. No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I know where–</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Hope I didn’t bother you. Goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Hey, come back here. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Jim!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Who’s that!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: It’s me!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How’d you find me? What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: They’re looking for you!–</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Everybody! Crunch and Goon and everybody! I
think they’re going to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We know.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: They think you told the police on them.
They–who’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Judy.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Help me in!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey where’d you go?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I’m here. Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come out come out wherever you are!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Shut up. Are you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No. I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: We’re safe here. I hope. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wow! Well now-there-then!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Isn’t it crazy?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wowee ow wow! Let’s take it for the summer.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, Jim!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No–come on. Should we rent or are we in a
buying mood, dear?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You decide, darling. Remember our budget.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Don’t give it a thought. Only three million
dollars a month!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Oh, we can manage that! I’ll scrimp and save
and work my fingers to the bone…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why don’t we just rent it for the season?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You see, we’ve just–oh, you tell him, darling.
I’m so embarrassed I could die!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well–we’re newlyweds.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: There’s just one thing. What about–</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Children? Well, we really don’t encourage
them. They’re so noisy and troublesome, don’t you agree?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Yes. And so terribly annoying when they cry. I
just don’t know what to do when they cry, do you dear?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Of course. Drown them like puppies.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: See, we’re very modern.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Shall I show you the nursery? It’s far away
from the rest of the house. If you have children–Oh I hate the word!–or
if you decide to adopt one–they can carry on and you’ll never even
notice. In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again,
much less talk to them.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Talk to them! Heavens!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nobody talks to children! They just tell them
one thing and mean another.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: It’s wonderful that you understand so
well–and so young too! You know the most wonderful feature about the
nursery?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: There’s only one key.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We’ll take it!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Hang loose. We got all night.</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: That maid saw us. She could identify us
too.</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: You still want to go home, Moose?</p>
<p><strong>moose</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Then shut your mouth before your guts run
out!</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: What guts?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Quick! Fill the pool!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let’s see how long we can stay under.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Man, you’re schizoid!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m what? What?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You can’t talk underwater!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I bet you hear everything I say!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Isn’t he schizoid?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey! How ’bout that!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Haven’t you noticed your personality
splitting?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Not lately.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How do you know so much about this junk,
Plato?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I had to go to a head-shrinker. I only went
twice though. My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii
instead.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No. Seriously. What’s your trouble?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I don’t know but whatever it is, it’s gone
now. I mean I’m happy now. Here.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I came here before.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: When was that?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: When I was here? When I ran away. I used to
run away a lot but they always took me back.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Mom and Dad. I used to be in my crib and I’d
listen to them fight.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You remember that far back? Boy, I can’t even
remember yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Plato, where’s your father now?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: He’s dead. He was a hero in the China
Sea.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You told me he’s a big wheel in New York!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I did? Well, he might as well be dead. What’s
the difference?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You have a long life-line.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: So have you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ever been in a place like this before?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Not exactly. It’s certainly huge.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How many rooms do you think there are?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Should we explore?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey! Will you look at this room! Judy?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Want to read any books? Take your pick! Isn’t
this the craziest?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Your hand’s all wet and it’s shaky. You’re so
funny.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I don’t know–you just are. Leaving a light for
Plato. That was nice.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Maybe he’s scared of the dark.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Here we are– out of cigarettes– Junior’s in the
nurs’ry– See how late it gets–</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You don’t need to do that.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There’s something I should tell you, Judy.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I know already. We don’t have to pretend
now.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What a relief!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Is this what it’s like to love somebody?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You disappointed?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Funny Jimmy. You’re so clean and you–this is
silly.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You smell like baby powder.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So do you.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I never felt so clean before.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you
and not for me.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I love somebody. All the time I’ve been
looking for someone to love me and now–I love somebody. And it’s so
easy. Why is it easy now?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It is for me too.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I love you, Jim. I really mean it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I mean it too.</p>
<p><strong>goon</strong>: What you stopping for?</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: You scam a car up there?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Nobody’s lived in that hunk of junk for
five-six years.</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Well, what do you know! I feel a kick coming
on!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: This is Unit 17. Unit 17.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: Come in, Unit 17.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We just zeroed three kids in a heap. Crest
Drive and Observatory. Looks like house-breaking. Send us some help.
They may be armed. Over.</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Moose! Take the steps! Goon! The other
side.</p>
<p><strong>crunch</strong>: Come on! Let’s make it!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Save me!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: What you run out on me for! What you leave me
alone for?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I don’t want you for my father!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Your father!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You crazy nut! You crazy, crazy nut!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Get away from me!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jim!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Halt!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Come here, son.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Just walk over here quietly now– and there
won’t be any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Jim! Watch out!</p>
<p><strong>first officer</strong>: Take the house! I’ll head him
off.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Halt! Halt!</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: –located at Summit Drive–the Planetarium.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The planetarium? One kid inside– five
housebreaking in area. Will proceed. There are some kids in trouble–
you’ll have to go with me.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Perfectly all right.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Did he hit you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: We have to go back!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No! I got to find him.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: After he tried to shoot you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: He didn’t mean it–we shouldn’t have left him.
He needed us.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: He needed you, maybe. So do I.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: He needs you too. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: You should have heard him talk about you
tonight. Like you were the hero in the China Seas.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sure. He was trying to make us his family.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: They’re killing him!</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Come out of there.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: You’re making it tough on yourself, kid.
Come out quietly now. You didn’t kill anybody yet.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Need a little help here!</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: We heard firing. He get anybody? You
alone?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: We got a cookaboo inside. He wounded some
kid earlier.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: How’d he get in?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Smashed the front door.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Any other entrance?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Down in back.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Silence. Please maintain silence. Keep back
and stay off the pavements. Keep back and stay off the pavements. There
will be emergency vehicles coming through. This warning is for your own
protection.</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: I don’t know, lady. Some kid’s in trouble.
Stand back, please.</p>
<p><strong>negro woman</strong>: I got to know. My boy run off tonight.
He had a gun with him, too.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Hello, Ray–Know anything about this?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: As much as you do–Loan me your mike, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Help yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I am addressing the boy in the planetarium. I
am speaking to the boy inside. This is Ray Framek from the Juvenile
Division–</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You are now surrounded. You are surrounded by
many armed police. Whoever you are, drop your weapon and come
outside.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Come outside. Clasp your hands over your head
and come outside quietly–</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Frank!</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Stay here. That was my son!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I think I know my son.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Jim Stark! I’m addressing Jim Stark. Nobody
will harm you or your friends if you follow these instructions. We are
here to protect you. Drop your guns and come outside. Nobody will hurt
you if you do as I say–</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Officers! Another boy and girl just ran into
the planetarium. We do not know if they are armed. Hold your positions
until further instruction.</p>
<p><strong>chief</strong>: Ambulance. Ambulance is coming through. Clear
a passage. Will you people make way there?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato? Plato, you in there? Hey, I’m going to
open the door now. You’ll be able to see me and you can shoot me if you
want, but just remember one thing, Plato–You’re my friend. That means a
lot to me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Boy, I’m blind as a bat! You got a match? I’m
going to break my neck in here. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I’ve got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know. Light a match, will you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s swell. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: You think the end of the world will come at
nighttime, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No. At dawn.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I just have a feeling. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, stop hiding and stand up. I can’t talk to
you if I don’t see you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey, look at the stars, Plato. Stand up and
look at the stars.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Why did you run out on me?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We didn’t run out. We were coming right
back.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Sure I’m sure. Judy’s waiting. You ready to
come out now?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I promise nothing’ll happen if you do. You want
my jacket? It’s warm.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Can I keep it?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You want to give me your gun now, Plato?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: My gun?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: In your pocket. Give it to me.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I need it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You trust me, don’t you? Just give it to me for
a second.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: You promised to give it back.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Friends never break promises, do they? Okay.
Here. Now listen. There are a lot of people outside and they all want
you to be safe. You understand that? They said I could come in and bring
you out.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: They like you. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: Hi, Plato!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Who’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Just a guard.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: I shot at one of them.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But you didn’t hurt anybody.</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Those aren’t my friends. Make them go
away.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ray! Will you tell these guys to move back?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato! Don’t be a fool!</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s Jim!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Plato!</p>
<p><strong>plato</strong>: Keep away from me! I don’t believe you
anymore!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But I’ve got the bullets! The gun was
