<p><strong>hong kong - an outdoor marketplace</strong>: Crowded. Filled
with oriental and British merchants. You can buy anything here.
Electronics. Food. Any- thing.</p>
<p><strong>rand peltzer</strong>: walks through the owd. An American
businessman.1-He wears a tas eful g3,y suit. He’s thin, with
distinguished good looks and thin brown hair. He’s 56 years old. Rand
looks around; fascinated by the vast array of people and merchandise. He
stops at a booth. A tiny ORIENTAL, WOMAN stands behind the counter. Rand
gives her a polite smile.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Hi. I’m from out of town… on business from the
U.S. The woman nods and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>an oriental man</strong>: passes by. He is very old. Deep
wrinkles. Long white hair. Ragged clothes. A rotted smile. Overhearing
Rand, the man stops to eavesdrop.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I’m looking for a present… for my son. The
woman nods. She searches through her wares. She holds up a basketball.
Rand shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: He’s not really involved in sports… The woman
puts away the basketball. She picks up a Sony “Walkman”. Rand again
shakes his head.,</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: No. I want something unusual… something he
can’t get at home… something different..</p>
<p><strong>a hand</strong>: reaches out and grabs Rand’s arm. Startled,
he turns. The Oriental man stands before him. He stares into Rand’s
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>oriental man</strong>: I can help you. He leads Rand away
from the booth.</p>
<p><strong>oriental man</strong>: I offer something very different. Very
unusual. Rand is puzzled. The Oriental leads him to a doorway.</p>
<p><strong>oriental man</strong>: Follow me. He opens the door,
motioning for Rand to follow. Rand pauses, skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>oriental man</strong>: Come. Take a look. It will cost you
nothing. You won’t be disappointed. The Oriental enters. Rand shrugs and
follows.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: Rand follows the man up a narrow, dark set
of stairs. At the top, they enter a room.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>oriental man</strong>: It is called ’ Mogwai ’ . A very rare
and intelligent animal. I found it in the fields near my home It will
obey all orders. It learns fast. The Oriental looks at Mogwai and claps
his hands.</p>
<p><strong>oriental man</strong>: And if you are ever in need of a song…
He claps his hands to the creature.</p>
<p>****: Music. Mogwai begins to hum, in an unearthly falsetto. It’s
beautiful. Rand watches with wide eyes. He feels like a child again.</p>
<p><strong>rand -</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>oriental man</strong>: One hundred American Dollars. Cash.
Rand removes five twenties from his wallet. He gives them to the man.
The Oriental smiles and claps his hands. Mogwai jumps onto Rand’s
shoulders. Rand pets it. Mogwai emits a cute giggle.</p>
<p><strong>oriental man</strong>: It never sleeps. It will eat any-
thing… but prefers raw meat.</p>
<p>****: It must always be kept indoors during the day. It lives in
shadow. It hates bright light. Direct sunlight will kill it. Rand nods.
He takes Mogwai from his shoulder and puts it into the box. Rand puts
the box under his arm. The Oriental smiles</p>
<p><strong>oriental man</strong>: Your son will enjoy his new friend.
Rand smiles and exits. The Oriental takes a bite from his raw fish.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Yes, Fred. The Tai-Chan account is definite.
MmmHmm. My plane l eaves in twenty minutes. See you in Pennsylvania. He
hangs up. He picks up his bags and walks to the check- in counter.</p>
<p><strong>the check-in girl</strong>: tags Mogwai’s box and puts it on
the conveyer belt. Rand watches the box disappear through the baggage
chute.</p>
<p><strong>check-in girl</strong>: Don’t worry, sir. Your pet will be
safe. Rand smiles.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Devil. She moves to the next passenger.
Rand stares. Surprised. Confused.</p>
<p><strong>credits begin over various images of this small
town.</strong>: One week before Christmas. It’s snowing hard. A man
hangs Christmas lights outside of his home. His young son helps.
Children ice skate along a large,. frozen lake. A woman trudges through
the snow, to her mailbox. A down parka is over her pajamas. Kingston’s
business district. Chilly gas station atten- dants pump gas into cars. A
Pharmacy owner hangs “Merry Christmas” in his store window. Telephone
line workers share hot coffee from a thermos. The Union Savings and
Trust Bank. Two teenagers push a woman s car from a ditch.</p>
<p><strong>inside.</strong>: Crowded. Several peoplestandin line.</p>
<p><strong>billy peltzer</strong>: a bank teller, writes out a receipt
for a customer.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. deagle</strong>: an elderly woman, walks to Billy’s
window. She’s a real prude. Tight lips. Heavy make-up. Bleached hair.
Cheap fur coat. She hands Billy a personal check.</p>
<p><strong>tracy allen</strong>: another teller, works beside Billy.
Tracy is pretty. Big brown eyes. A sexy smile. Long dark hair. Perfect
figure. 25 years old. Tracy counts out some cash to a customer. She’s
trying to concentrate, to keep her mind on work.. But it’s diffi- cult
when</p>
<p><strong>gary lucia</strong>: the bank security guard, is trying to
make her laugh. He stands by the bank entrance, making funny faces at
Tracy. Gary is 30 years old. Former high school jock. Dark, thick hair.
Deep brown eyes. Muscular. A strong, handsome face. Meanwhile, Billy
gives the check back to Mrs. Deagle.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I can’t cash this, M’am. Your last check
hasn’t cleared.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. deagle</strong>: Don’t you recognize me?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No, M’am. I’m sorry…</p>
<p>****: My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle! My husband manages the.Sparkle
Market! We’ve been banking here for sixteen years!</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: T at’s very nice, M’am. But your c eck hasn’t
cleared and…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. deagle</strong>: That’s the problem with this world.
It’s a mess because of people like</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s not my.fault your check didn’t clear,
M’am,</p>
<p><strong>mrs. deagle</strong>: Don’t get smart with me, oung man.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I wasn’t getting smart, I was…</p>
<p>****: Where’s the president? I want to see the bank president! Billy
rubs his eyes. Tense. Embarrassed. Everyone watches the scene. Tracy.
Gary. The customers.</p>
<p><strong>roland fresco</strong>: the bank’s Vice President, walks over
to Billy and Mrs. beagle. Roland is tall, slender with thin grey hair
and a pencil thin moustache. Friendliness and courtesy are his job. He
smiles at Mrs. Deagle.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: What seems to be the problem, M’am?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. deagle</strong>: My name is Mrs. Julia Deagle. This
young teller is being very rude! I demand that you fire him!</p>
<p>****: Now,-Mrs. Deagle…I’m sure this isn’t that serious. I’m sure an
apology would fix things right up. Wouldn’t it? The woman shrugs.’
Roland turns to Billy.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Apologize to the woman, Billy. Billy leans
to Roland.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I. didn’t do anything wrong.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Just apologize. Roland.leans back and smiles
at Mrs. Deagle. Billy looks at her. He doesn’-t want to do this.
Everyone in the bank is watching him, waiting for him to take a stand.
Billy sighs. He needs his job.</p>
<p><strong>bill°</strong>: I’m sorry, Mrs. Deagle. She nods and smiles.
Roland puts his hand on the woman’s shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>roland</strong>: Come back to my desk, Mrs. Deagle. I’ll
personally take care of your banking problems. Roland walks back to his
office with Mrs. Deagle. Gary chuckles. Tracy goes back to work. Billy
just sits. Angry. Humiliated. He calls the next customer.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Next.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: stands in the lobby, putting on.her coat.
Billy moves to help her.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Let me. He helps her on with the coat.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You look very pretty today.</p>
<p>****: Thanks, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I mean.. .not that you don’t look pretty
every day…But you look especially pretty today.</p>
<p>****: You’re cute. Gary walks up. He puts his arm through
Tracy’s.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Let’s go. I’m hungry. Hey, Peltzer…Whydidn’t
you stand. up to that old bag, today?</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s a book. You read 1t. Billy exchanges a
smile with Tracy. Gary isn’t amused.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: I know that, asshole. I meant what’s it
about?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: King Arthur. . .Sir Lancelot… Knights of the
Round . Table… Dragons…</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Aren’t you a little old for that kinda’
junk?</p>
<p>****: Beats T.V.</p>
<p>****: I’ll take ‘Monday Night Football’ over this crap any day.
C’mon. Let’s go. Tracy gives a wave to Billy. She and Gary walk away.
Billy watches. He draws an imaginary sword from his side. He lifts the
sword and lunges forward. At Gary. Billy sits at a table. Alone. He’s
reading his book. He eats, but his wide eyes never leave the page. He’s
fas- cinated by the story. Like a child. He gets to a funny section.. He
laughs.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: What a nut. Laughin’ to himself. That’s the
kind of guy who’ll shoot a president.</p>
<p>****: I don’t see anything wrong with him. I’m sure he’s very
intelligent.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Yeah, and those are the guys who always crack.
The real smart guys. 6ti He’s gotta be a psycho. 26 years old, still
lives with his parents. Doesn’t have a girlfriend. He’s always alone.
Real weirdo. The others agree. Tracy doesn’t. She likes Billy. Billy
continues to read, totally caught up in his book. Totally caught up in
his fantasy.</p>
<p><strong>car radio</strong>: .And the snow keeps coming, folks. Looks
like we’re gonna have a White Christmas. Another three inches is
expected tonight… Billy looks out of his side window and sees</p>
<p><strong>pete fountane</strong>: walking home from school. Pete is 16
years old. A chunky, pleasant baby faced kid. With his bright orange
down jacket, Pete resembles a tiny snowman. Suddenly, Pete.slips on the
ice. Bam. Right on his ass. His school books scatter over the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Pete…You okay? Pete nods. Billy helps him up.
Pete brushes himself off. Billy is amused by the boy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You want a ride home?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Thanks. That’d be nice. Billy helps Pete pick
up his schoolbooks.</p>
<p>****: Lancelot raises Excalibur and… Wham! He knocks the Black Knight
down ! Then with-another swing… Wham! He finishes him off!</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Wow… Billy digs into his pocket and gives Pete
the copy of “Once And Future King”.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Here. You can borrow it. Pete takes the
book.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Hey, Billy…You know so much about Vikings and
stuff…You should write one of these stories yourself.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Really?</p>
<p>****: ‘Savage Hearts Of The Round Table’. A Trilogy Of Honor.,
Adventure nd Romance by William :C. P.eltzer</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Sounds gre t. When can I read it?</p>
<p>****: I’ve only got about 70 pages done… But as soon as it’s
published, you’ll get one of the first copies. Speci- ally autographed
by the author. Pete smiles. Billy makes a turn. He pulls into the
parking lot of</p>
<p><strong>dougal’s antiques</strong>: A huge, three story home, with an
antique shop set up on the first floor. Billy and Pete get out of the
car and enter the store.</p>
<p><strong>dorry dougal</strong>: the 64 year old storekeeper, stands
behind the counter. Dorry is husky, bald on top, with thick patches of
red hair on his temples. A huge, red moustache sits beneath his bulbous
nose. His arms are thick, hairy. A strong Irish- man.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: Good afternoon to you, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hi, Dorry. Is it ready yet? Dorry smiles. He
reaches to a shelf behind the counter. He removes ,a long object,
wrapped in a piece of green cloth. He rests it on the counter.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: It’s an authentic replica of an Eleventh
Century sword. Billy’s eyes examine every inch of the sword. It’s
beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: I got most of the rust off…But there were a
couple spots that wouldn’t budge. Billy runs his finger along the
blade.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: Careful. It’s sharp. A big smile covers
Billy’s face.- He’s in love with the sword.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What do I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: Two hundred. You can pay me twenty a week.
Billy pulls a twenty from his wallet and pays Dorry. Billy carefully
wraps the sword and puts it under his arm.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Thanks, Dorry.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: My pleasure, son. Billy and Pete exit the
store.</p>
<p><strong>’ he peltzer home</strong>: blends in with the others. But
it’s a little nicer, better kept. A row of colored lights is draped
across the snowy shrubbery. Billy’s Pinto pulls into the drive. He gets
out, sword under his arm. He enters the house.</p>
<p><strong>barney</strong>: a friendly Irish Setter, greets Billy. He
pets the dog and hangs his coat in the hail- closet.</p>
<p><strong>lynn peltzer</strong>: Billy’s Mother. 53 years old. Slightly
heavy. Well dressed. Styled brown hair. A pretty woman. She hears Billy
enter. She quickly pops a valium from a small pill bottle. She calls to
her son.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Billy? Is the’.t you honey?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: sighs.He hates to be called “honey”.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Dinner will be ready in ten minutes. Okay. He
hurries upstairs w Iith</p>
<p><strong>dining room</strong>: Billy sits at the table, eating dinner
with Lynn.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: How was work?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Have you asked that Tracy girl out yet?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I was just curious.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah,.well it’s none of your business.
Nervous,Lynn popsvalfum with her wine.</p>
<p>****: I guess it’s none of my business that your clothes are washed
and ironed, or that you have a hot meal on the table…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. It isn’t. I’m old enough to take care of
that stuff myself. I’m old enough to get a place of my own.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Don’t start that again. Your Father’s coming
home tonight.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Good. I think we should talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: It’ll put him in a bad mood.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No, it’ll put you in a bad mood. Lynn and
Billy exchange a glare. They look down at their food. A few silent,
uncomfortable moments pass. Lynn looks back to Billy. She smiles. Time
for the tender approach. She touches his hand.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Billy, honey…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Stop calling me ‘honey’.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Dad and I just don’t want you to have to
struggle like we did. We want to help, until you can support yourself as
a writer.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Bit it’s gonna take me another- year to
finish my novel. . .and what if it doesn’t get published?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: It’ll get published.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: But what if it doesn’t? Are you gonna take
care of me until I’m old and grey, working on my 25th unpublished
novel?…</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: If it takes that long, yes.</p>
<p>****: Don’t you understand?.. .I’ve got to ’leave now! I rve got to
try and make it on my own now! Before Lynn.can reply, A VOICE
INTERRUPTS.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Is anybody home? Lynn stands and whispers to
Billy.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Please, let’s forget about this. Just for
tonight. Okay? Billy pauses. Finally gives in and nods. Lynn stands. She
pops another valium and exits to greet her husband. We hear them,
exchange an excited “.hello”. They kiss and laugh, glad to be in each
other’s arms. Billy just sits. Burning.</p>
<p>****: Billy .. , Billy walks to his Father. They embrace.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hi, Dad. They hold each other for a second.
Lynn closes the front door. Rand picks up Mogwai’s case. Lynn turn’s to
her husband.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Not now. I’ve got a surprise for both of you.
Come on. He leads them into the living room. Lynn and. Billy exchange a
puzzled glance. They follow Rand.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What is it? A.monkey? A rat?.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Your new pet.</p>
<p>****: Mj Oh, yeah?… Mogwai starts to sing, humming in that unearthly
falsetto.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: He’s singing.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Sounds kind of creepy. Barney still
growls.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Barney! Be a good dog and go up- stairs!
Barney reluctantly hops off Billy’s lap and exits. Lynn stares at
Mogwai.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I think he’s just darling. Mogwai. Rand holds
the creature out to Billy.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Hold him.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Maybe later.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: C’mon. He won’t bite. Billy forces himself to
take the creature. Mogwai nestles close to Billy. Rand smiles at his
son.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: He likes you. Billy looks nauseous. Lynn
stands.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You two look so cute together. I have to take
a picture. Lynn walks to a nearby drawer, opens it and removes-a Kodak
Instamatic. Mogwai is on Billy’s shoulder, licking his cheek.. Billy
hates it.</p>
<p><strong>rand -</strong>: I want you to take good care of him. Lynn
focuses the camera on Billy and Mogwai.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Okay smile. Billy forces a smile. Mogwai still
licks his cheek. Lynn snaps the picture. Flash! Mogwai lets out a high
scream. Frightened of the bright light, Mogwai jumps back, accidentally
scratching Billy’s cheek.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Little bastard. Mogwai scurries back to Rand.
He pets the creature, comforting it</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Shut up. Mogwai stops singing. Billy goes
back to his writing. Mogwai.hops from the shelf. Staying out of the
direct light, the creature moves across the desktop and cuddles up to
Billy’s arm. He jumps back.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Get off of me. Mogwai just looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Get.off`my desk. Billy shines the bright.desk
light into the creature’s eyes. Mogwai screams and jumps. off the desk,
to the floor. Billy looks down at the creature.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Stay down there. Billy goes back to his work.
Mogwai is-bored. The creature leaps up to the bed.. It sees the sword.
Mogwai lifts one end, examining it. It’s too heavy. The sword slips off
the bed and falls to the floor. Billy turns. Mogwai takes a step back.
Guilty. Frightened. Billy picks up the sword. The handle is chipped.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You stupid little… Billy raises the sword
over.Mogwai. He’s ready to kill the tiny creature. Mogwai loo] .s up at
Billy. The creature is shivering. It is frightened. It’s big, green eyes
are watery. Billy suddenly feels sympathetic. He lowers the sword and
picks up the.creature.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry.. .just try to be more careful. Billy holds Mogwai to
his chest. He’s petting it, com- forting it.</p>
<p><strong>car. radio</strong>: It looks like the snow has stopped for
awhile. But don’t put away those ear muffs, more flurries are scheduled
for tonight…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Starting work early today?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Oh, hi. Well, I thought the roads would be
icy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’ve got a half hour before work. Wanna go
have a cup of coffee? She.pauses and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: .and if I sell the novel, I’ll •be able to
quit the bank.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’d love to quit. I’d run straight to the
airport and buy a one way ticket to Paris.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why Paris?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I’ve only seen it in movies and T.V… . But it
seems like it’s got everything that this town doesn’t…Museums…great
restaur ants… Beautiful artworks and architecture… Listen to me, talking
like I’ve been there 10 times. I shouldn’t get so carried away. It’s
only a dream.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hey…Don’t give up on your dreams. They just
might come true. Tracy shrugs and takes a sip of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Can I ask you a personal question? What is it
with you and Gary? Is he your boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: He thinks he is.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Do you think he is?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: No. I think of him more as a friend. But he
thinks of me as a lot more.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: So there’s a possibility…I mean… I.just might
have a chance with you?</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: , Don’t give up on your dreams. They just
might come true. They both laugh.</p>
<p><strong>camera pulls back to reveal</strong>: Standing across the
street, looking into the coffee shop window. He watches Billy and Tracy.
An angry, jealous</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Hello? Is anybody home?</p>
<p>****: n here, Pete. Billy holds the tray of brownies to him.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Want some?</p>
<p>**pete _**: I’m s’posed to be on a diet… He grabs a brownie. He
notices Mogwai’s case.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What’s in there? Pete walks over and opens the
case. Mogwai hops out, onto the bed. The creature giggles. Pete is,
taken aback.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: A present from my Dad. Pete picks up the
creature and pets it. Pete likes Mogwai.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: It’s neat. Billy shrugs. Mogwai sees the
brownies. The creature hops from Pete’s hands, onto the desk. Mogwai
grabs a brownie and starts to eat.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Hey, Billy.. .You think I might be able to
borrow it? Just for a night?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I dunno, Pete…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: C’mon…My Mom will never know. I’ll hide it
under my bed. Pete reaches down to pick up Mogwai. His hand clumsily
knocks over the water bottle. A few drops of water splash Mogwai. The
creature arches its back and lets out a high pitched scream. Billy is
surprised. Pete takes a step back. Scared. Mogwai tenses up. The spots
on its body that were hit with water begin to bubble… .expand…’ Billy
can’t believe his eyes. Mogwai writhes in pain. The spots on its body
expand more, getting bigger, bigger.. .ready to explode. Billy and Pete
stare. Fascinated. The spots burst.</p>
<p><strong>four new creatures</strong>: popout. Clones of Mogwai. The
spots on Mogwai’s body bond together and disappear, as if they were
never there. There are now five identical creatures on the desktop.
Billy and Pete share a shocked glance. Billy grabs the water bottle. He
has to be certain that he wasn’t halucinating. He splashes a little more
water on one of the new creatures. The process begins again. The
creature’s body,contorts. A few lumps form. The lumps expand until…they
burst.</p>
<p><strong>three more creatures are born.</strong>: Billy tries to make
sense out of it all. EIGHT CREATURES stand on.the desk top, examining
their new world. Billy picks up his glass of milk. He splashes some milk
on one of the crealtures. Nothing happens.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: They must only multiply with plain tap
water.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: Wow..•.this•is better than “Twilight Zone Pete
looks at Billy.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Now can I have one?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Huh? Well, yeah. I guess so. Pete grabs one
of the creatures, taking it from the group. It cries out. In a high,
piercing scream. The other creatures leap at Pete. They grab the
creature and bring it back to their group.</p>
<p>****: Maybe I won’t take one. The creatures have moved to the
brownies. They rip the brownies to pieces, devouring them. They’re
giggling.</p>
<p><strong>i rand</strong>: What are you so worried abot?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dad…We don’t know anything about these
things.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: We know they’re cute.. We know..” they’re
intelligent. And now we know they multiply by water.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, but isn’t that pretty weird? I mean, if
I throw water on�Barney over there, we’re not gonna;getjten copies. A
creature licks Rand’s ear. He chuckles.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: All I know, is that I’ve got a million dollars
sitting in my lap.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I’m going to market these things.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh, Christ. C’mo’i,Dad…that’s …</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Just imagine the excitement when word gets
out. Everyone will want a Mogwai of their very own.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Don’t you think we should have them checked
out first? Just to make sure…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: No. If we want to make a big profit, we have
to move:fast I have some investors coming over to the house on Thursday.
Who,knows?…Mogwai could replace dog as man’s best friend. wls from his
corner. Rand continues to play with the creatures. Billy watches.
Skeptical.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Oh, hi Gary. Look, I’m kind of in a hurry.
Gary grabs Billy by the collar and throws him against the car.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: a&lt; ; Listen, Peltzer…she’s my girl- friend.
Keep your hands off. Under- stand? Billy nods.Gary lets him go.He turns
and walks away. Billy straightens his clothes. He glares at Gary.</p>
<p><strong>roy hanson’</strong>: the Biology teacher, stands at the
sink. He’s washing out some used glass j4rs and basins Roy is 35 years
old. Tall. Thin. Black. Good looking. Pete knocks on the door. Billy
enters with him. Roy turns.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Hey, Pete-what’s up?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Mr. Hanson…this is my friend Billy. He wants
to talk to you about somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, sure… .I’m Roy Hanson. What can I do</p>
<p><strong>f</strong>: or you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Well, you’re the closest thing this town’s
got to a scientist… and I need some information about an animal.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What kind of animal?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’s what I’m trying to figure out.</p>
<p><strong>intbilly’s room - later</strong>: The curtains are drawn. The
lights are dim. The eight creatures are on the desk top. Giggling.
Humming in falsetto. Billy enters with Roy and Pete. Roy stares at the
creatures. He is shocked. Delighted.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I’ve never seen anything like this. Billy grabs
the water bottle.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Watch this. Billy squeezes a drop of water on
one creature. Mogwa’ lets out a scream. A lump appears on the creature’s
back. The lump gets bigger…bigger…bigger … Roy watches with wide eyes.
Suddenly, another creature bursts from Mogwai’s body. NINE IDENTICAL
CREATURES now stand on the desk top.</p>
<p><strong>.roy</strong>: Holy shit. He remains-speechless for a few
moments. He looks at Billy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: May.I stay for a while?…Run a few tests?…</p>
<p>****: My parents won’t be home until 7:00. You’ve got three hours.
Roy takes off his coat and opens his black leather case. Billy exits
with Pete.</p>

plays.</p>
<p><strong>billy and pete</strong>: sit on the sofa, watching the T.V.
Roy enters. He sits across from Billy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I discovered some interesting things…</p>
<p>****: The creatures are drawn to water. if they sense water nearby…
they’ll go to it. th y’re hunting for foo or water.. they hate to be
separated. I t ied to move one from the others. They cried out. Clawing.
Screeching.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Yeah…that’s what happened when I tried to take
one.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: If one is separated. The others will
follow.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: They qan’t multiply by water if their
environment temperature is below ’25 degrees- It’s amazing. They have no
bio- logical link with any other species of animal…in the whole world.
Billy gives an uncertain nod.-</p>
<p><strong>rev. 4/30/82 35.</strong>: He gets out of bed. He looks at
his sword, hanging above the bed. He takes the sword from the wall. He
walks out of the.room.</p>
<p><strong>hallway</strong>: Billy walks. Sword in hand. The noises get
louder. Crisper. Clearer. Nervous, Billy descends the dark stairs. He
arrives at the bottom. He stops to listen. The sounds are coming from
the living room.</p>
<p><strong>living room</strong>: Billy enters. He looks to the floor.
Beneath the’Christmas tree. The creatures surround Barney. They have
killed the dog. Billy tries to move. He’s frozen. The creatures are
eating the dog. They look up at Billy. Their bright green eyes are
fiery. Blood covers their mouths. They smile. They giggle. Billy
screams.</p>
<p><strong>close up - a canvas mail bag</strong>: The bag moves.
Squirms. Shakes. The creatures are inside. Rand carries the bag up a
ladder that leads into the attic.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: This should keep them out for the rest of the
niht…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Tomorrow we’ll take them out in the sun…</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: .and.finish them off. Lynn nods. Rand looks at
Billy.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I’m sorry, son. I never expected to…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Forget it. Billy stares coldly at his Father.
Embarrassed, Rand looks away.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: We should all get back to sleep. Rand puts his
arm around Lynn. They walk to their bed- room. Billy looks up at the
attic door. The creatures’ scratching is heard.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: What in the hell?… Billy picks up a broomstick
andl pokes one of the things. Won’t budge. Hard as a rock.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Damn things are stuck to the floor. Rand
picks up a baseball bat. He raises it over his head and swings down,
hard. Against the pod. The bat snaps in two. The pod is unblemished.
Rand rubs his stinging hands. Billy and Rand just look at each other.
Puzzled.</p>
<p><strong>a.</strong>: r?1ND Like a butterfly?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Exactly. Those things in the attic-are cocoons.
Inside,. the creatures are going through some sort of change…a
metamorphosis.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Why did they attack my dog?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Simple. They’re animals. They were hungry.
Aside from water, food is their main concern.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: How long until they hatch?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: A week…a month…I really can’t say.</p>
<p>****: I’m not waiting around to find out.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Billy, don’t be hasty…You’ve stumbled onto a
new life form. What comes out of those cocoons could be a major
scientific discovery…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Screw’science. I want them des- troyed.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Billy …Maybe Mr. Hanson’s got a point…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Dad, they killed Barney. Or have you already
forgotten? Rand just looks’at his son. Lynn pops a valium in the
background.</p>

appears unharmed.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Not even warm.</p>
<p>****: They’re indestructible.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Now what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: I get back from Seattle on Wednesday. I’ll
call some con- struction people. They’ll come in next week and cut these
things out of the floor.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t think we should wait. Let’s do it
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: No. It’s late. I’ve got an early plane to
catch.</p>
<p>****: The attic door is locked. There are no windows up here. Nothing
can get in or out. Rand pats Billy on the back.</p>
<p><strong>rand</strong>: Son, you’ve got to stop worrying.</p>

on his face.</p>

Billy smiles.</p>
<p><strong>a three fingered black claw</strong>: suddenly breaks out of
one cocoon. It clutches at the air.</p>
<p><strong>another claw</strong>: breaks through the shell of another
cocoon. They all begin to hatch., Claws emerge from each one, reaching
for the air.</p>
<p><strong>a loud rattling noise echoes from upstairs.</strong>: to
listen.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: slowly moves to the kitch n doorway. Sh
listens.</p>
<p><strong>the attic door</strong>: The wood surrounding the lock begins
to splinter. It finally snaps. The door pops open. The lock falls to the
floor. A loud thump.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: jumps at the noise. Scared, she runs to the
kitchen phone.</p>
<p><strong>tracy ’</strong>: Billy…I thought you were great. He smiles.
Gary watches the two of them.</p>

two valiums from her bottle.</p>
<p><strong>the attic.</strong>: Lynn exits the kitchen and slowly walks
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Nervous. Sweating. Behind the wheel of his
car. He tries to drive fast, but the heavy snowfall and icy roads
prevent it. Outside, the sun is going down.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: She’s arrived at the top of the stairs. It’s
dark up here. She looks to the end of the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: still driving. He tries to pass a slow truck.
He hits a is spot.</p>
<p><strong>the car</strong>: swerves and spins off the road. It lands in
a ditch. The engine stops.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: tries to start it. Nothing happens. It’s
stalled.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No…Not now… He tries again. No good. It’s
dead. Frustrated, Billy slams his fist on the steering wheel. °</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: standing below the open attic door. She
tightly clutches her valium bottle. She looks up. Nothing but darkness.
Lynn pops another valium. She climbs theladder, into the attic.</p>

It’s dusk. People have begun to turn on their Christmas lights. Billy
runs harder. Faster. His house comes into view. At the e nd o f the
block.</p>
<p><strong>suddenly</strong>: Something leaps out and grabs Lynn by the
throat. A creature. We can’t see it clearly. - It moves too fast. It is
hiddenby the shadows. Other dark figures come at Lynn. More creatures.
They want their share of the food. Lynn watches in horror as the
creatures surround her head. She screams.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: sprints down his driveway. He arrives at the
porch of his home. He opens the front door.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: Dark. Silent. Billy calls out before
entering.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mom?.. Scattered giggling echoes from inside.
Billy flips on the’front hall..light.. A few tiny shadows scatter. They
dash into other rooms. Afraid of the light. Billy’slowly enters. He’s
scared. He looks to the top of the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Mom?… More giggling. Shaking’. Nervous. Billy
climbs the stairs. At the top, he quickly flips on the bright hall
light. Something darts up into the darkness of the attic. Escap- ing the

<p><strong>a creature</strong>: leaps from the attic, into the hallway.
Billy jumps back. Mogwai snarls at him. Mogwai has changed. It stands
two feet tall. The brown fur is gone, replaced by rock hard, rippled
armor. The arms and legs are muscular, covered with the same armor. The
paws have been replaced by claws. The fingernails are sharp. The tail is
long and pointed. Reptilian. It thrashes back and forth. Sharp white
horns have replaced the ears. The green eyes are larger. They bulge.
Evil. Angry.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: huge mouth distorts the face with its wide grin.
The countless teeth are long and sharp. Gleaming white. Fresh blood
drips from them. The giggle remains, undercut with a hungry animalistic
growl</p>

floor. Dead. Billy walks to her. Lynn is covered with bites and
scratches. Billy looks away. Angry. Saddened. He notices the cocoons.

goes white with fear. There’s more. He dashes out of the attic.</p>
<p><strong>upstairs hallway</strong>: Billy walks slowly. Clutching his
sword. Ready for an attack. He descends the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>a creature</strong>: leaps from the overhead chandelier. It
lands on Billy’s back. The creature tries to bite Billy’s neck. Billy
slams his blade ’nto Mogwai. He whacks the creature. Again and again.
Finally, Mogwai falls to the floor. Billy brings down his blade. Hard.
It slices Mogwai’s head off. The creature’s body quivers. It dies. Billy
moves to the living room.</p>
<p><strong>living room</strong>: Dimly lit. The fireplace burns. The
Christmas tree lights flash. Billy enters.</p>
<p><strong>an object</strong>: flies at Billy from across the room. He
ducks. A DINNER PLATE smashes against the wall behind him. Billy looks
to the</p>
<p><strong>china cabinet.</strong>: A CREATURE sits on the middle shelf.
Giggling. It throws another plate at-Billy. He bats the plate away with
his sword. Mogwai continues to throw plates at him. Billy dodges the
plates, making his way to the China Cabinet. There, he lunges forward
with his sword. Bullseye. Mogwai is stabbed. Straight through the
chest.</p>
<p><strong>rev. 4/30/82</strong>: The creature screams, writhing in
pain. It falls from the China shelf to the floor. Dead. Billy slowly
moves across the room. His eyes dart back and forth, looking for
creatures.’ He walks by the fireplace. Three large RED VELVET STOCKINGS
hang from the mantle. Each one is inscribed with a name: BILLY, RAND and
LYNN.</p>
<p><strong>a-creature</strong>: pops out of each stocking. Growling.
Snarling. Startled, Billy jumps back. The three creatures hop to the
floor and move towards</p>
<p><strong>billy:</strong>: He clutches his sword. Tight. Two creatures
leap at him. He spears one in mid-air. He quickly spins around, knocking
the other Mogwai to the ground. He stabs the creature in the throat. He
twists the sword until Mogwai chokes to death on its own blood. The
remaining creature attaches itself to Billy’s leg. It takes a bite from
his calf. Billy cries out in pair. Mogwai stays on. Biting hard. Billy
kicks his leg near the fireplace. Scared of the firelight, Mogwai lets
go. Billy stabs the creature.. He holds Mogwai in the roaring flames of
the fireplace. Mogwai screams until it burns to a crisp. Billy removes
his steaming sword. The charred creature collapses into the flames.
Dead. Billy checks his leg. A small bite. He walks to the kitchen.</p>

flash. THE CAMERA MOVES closer to the tree. TWO LARGER GREEN EYES„shine
from inside the tree. The eyes of ANOTHER CREATURE.;</p>
<p><strong>two creatures</strong>: are inside. They don’t notice Billy.
One has crawled into the large blender. It laps up the left over white
icing. The other sits on the table. It nibbles on the Santa cookies.
Billy looks at the bl!ende1r. It’s’ unplugged. Billy moves quickly. He
dashes across the room and plugs in the blender. It starts with’a loud
whirr. The startled creature spins inside.. Mogwai’s screams die as it
is chopped into a green mush. The remaining creature growls at Billy.
Billy lunges forward with his sword. Mogwai leaps out of the way, onto
the kitchen cabinet. Billy turns to the creature. Mogwai stands in front
of the open microwave oven. Billy pokes at the creature with his sword.
Mogwai takes a few steps back. Billy still pokes at Mogwai, forcing the
creature into the oven. Billy quickly closes theoven door. Mogwai is
trapped inside.</p>
<p><strong>living room</strong>: Billy enters. He looks at the dead
creatures. He sighs. Relieved. They’re all gone. Billy rests his sword
against the wall. He picks up the telephone and dials “0”.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yes, could you connect me with the Sheriff’s
Office?…</p>
<p><strong>a swift shadow</strong>: moves across the floor, behind
Billy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hello? …Is this Sheriff Lucia?…</p>
<p><strong>a claw</strong>: tears the phone cord from the wall.</p>
<p>****: Hello?…Hello?…</p>

from behind.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Hello?… It hisses.</p>
<p><strong>rev. 4/30/82</strong>: Billy turns. Face to face with Mogwai.
Billy glances to his sword. A few feet away. Against the wall. Mogwai
takes a step closer. Billy reaches for the sword. The creature leaps and
lands on Billy’s chest, knocking him to the floor. { .Billy wrestles
with the creature. He tries to grab the sword, but Mogwai is clawing and
biting at him. Billy’s hand finally reaches the sword. He snatches it.
He brings down the blade, into the creature’s arm. Mogwai jumps back.
Wounded. Billy stands. He raises his sword to finish off the creature.
Mogwai dodges theblade, jumping to the window ledge. Billy moves toward
the creature. Mogwai smashes through’the window, escaping into the
night. Billy hurries out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: The blizzard is starting up. Billy arrives
at the broken window. He looks to the ground and sees</p>
<p><strong>mogwai’s footprints in the snow</strong>: They stretch across
the backyards of suburbia, disappearing into the darkness. Following the
footprints, Billy runs after the creature. a cute, blonde-haired,
blue-eyed 8 year old backyard. She is building A snowman.</p>
<p><strong>peggy’s mother</strong>: opens the back door of their home.
She calls to her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Peggy! Come inside! It’s too dark! You’ll
ruin your eyes building the snowman!</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Just five more minutes.. And ‘Skippy The
Snowman’ will be finished. Please, Mommy?</p>
<p>****: Alright, young lady. But if you’re not inside this house in
five,’ minutes…</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: Thanks, Mommy. She goes back inside. Peggy
inserts pebbles for “Skippy’s” eyes.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: running through the snow. Following Mogwai’s
footprints.</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: inserting the final pebble for “Skippy’s”
smile. Peggy takes a step back. She looks over her creation. She
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>peggy 0</strong>: Gee, Skippy…You look cute.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: arrives in Peggy’s backyard. He sees the
young girl’s legs kicking from the snowman’s torso. Billy rushes over.
He grabs Peggy’s legs. A tug of war. Billy pulls Peggy out of the
snowman. Peggy brushes the snow from her face.</p>
<p><strong>e billy</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>peggy</strong>: A monster came out of Skippy the Snowman.
Billy quickly attacks the snowman with his sword. He swings and swings
until “Skippy” is nothing but a pile of snow. But there is no sign of
Mogwai. Billy spots footprints leading away from the snowman. Mogwai has
escaped. Billy runs after the footprints. Peggy watches him disappear
around the corner of the house. Peggy’s Mother opens the door. She is
puzzled by the pile of snow in front of Peggy.</p>

He can’t get to the roof. He watches Mogwai climb into-the building
through small chimney. Billy runs to the front door. He tries to open

<p><strong>hundreds of pairs of burning green eyes</strong>: fill the
gymnasium, shining in the darkness. Like a starry night.</p>
<p><strong>droves of mogwai</strong>: are still coming out of the
swimming pool. Brent is frozen. He tries to scream. The creatures notice
him. Several move towards him. Brent fires his pistol. Useless. There

<p><strong>mr. futters</strong>: a balding, middle-aged man, wearing a
bathrobe and pajamas, answers the door.</p>
<p>****: Billy Peltzer?…What’s going on here?..</p>

<p><strong>mr. futters</strong>: Have you been drinking?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No sir, I…</p>
<p><strong>mr. futters</strong>: And what the hell is that? A sword?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>mr. futters</strong>: And what are-you doing with the
Sheriff’s car? Are you on drugs? Billy starts to explain when</p>
<p><strong>mr. deagle</strong>: the next door neighbor, walks onto his
porch. Deagle is a portly man, with curly grey hair and a beard. He
calls to Mr. Futters</p>
<p><strong>mr. deagle</strong>: Hey, Joe…I saw the police car. You in
some kind of trouble?</p>
<p><strong>mr. futters</strong>: ,No, it’s this Peltzer kid. He thinks

<p><strong>mr. futters</strong>: 1 Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>mr. deagle</strong>: He’s a nut. Went crazy in the bank
today. Called my wife all kinds of names. You smartass son of a bitch.
If I was ten years younger I’d beat the crap out of you. Billy sighs,
frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. deagle</strong>: joins her husband on the porch.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. deagle</strong>: What’s the matter?… Oh, it’s you. Here
to apologize?</p>
<p><strong>mr. deagle</strong>: The boy went crazy, dear. carrying a
sword.</p>

good, and throw away the key. Mr. Deagle puts his arm around his
wife.</p>
<p><strong>mr. deagle</strong>: C’mon back inside, dear. Let’s finish
watching ‘Dallas’. G’night, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>mr. futters</strong>: Good night, Ed. You’ve got ten seconds
to get the hell out of my yard. Then I’m.calling the Sheriff…if he isn’t
out looking for you already. He slams the door and goes inside. Billy
just stands there. Defeated. Frustrated.</p>
<p><strong>a creature</strong>: hisses. Behind Billy. Billy turns.
Mogwai leaps at him. Billy raises his sword and swings. He knocks the
creature down. He stabs Mogwai. Mogwai dies with a long scream. Billy
looks up and sees</p>
<p><strong>the pack of creatures</strong>: moving down Main Street. They
have arrived. Looking for food. Many break into the house across the
street. There are some human screams. Then the house lights go out.</p>
<p><strong>rev. 4/30/82 73</strong>: Several creatures come towards
Billy. Billy runs to the police car. He opens the door and gets inside.

scatter away from she car.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: starts the engine. He squeals out of the
driveway.</p>

<p>****: But, Frank…With everybody out… Who’s gonna be here to answer
the Emergency phone calls?</p>
<p>****: ‘Help! The little gremlins are eating my baby!’ Gary laughs
hard at his joke. They exit the police station.</p>
<p><strong>camera stays behind</strong>: in the deserted police station.
We hear Frank and Gary get into the car and drive off.</p>
<p><strong>then</strong>: A telephone rings. And another phone rings.
And.another. People need help.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Shaky. Nervous. Behind the wheel of the

<p><strong>tracy</strong>: Billy! These things are all over my house…

the ladder.</p>
<p><strong>on the ground below</strong>: a creature jumps onto the
ladder. Tracy. is startled. She nearly falls. Billy grabs. a. better
hold of her. He drops his sword. It falls to the ground and lands in the
snow. The creature looks up and sees Billy and Tracy. A few feet above.
Mogwai begins to climb the ladder, going after them. Billy and Tracy
start to climb up the ladder. But the two other creatures come out of
Tracy’.s bedroom window. They see Billy and Tracy below. They climb oft
after them, down the ladder. Billy and Tracy are trapped. Sandwiched
between the creatures. Billy looks to his sword on the ground. So far
away.</p>

ladder back. It sways. He pulls harder. The ladder tilts to the ground.
Falling. The three creatures are thrown to the ground, into the deep

The creatures dig their way out of the snow. They move towards Billy and
Tracy. Billy snaps up his sword and jumps to his feet. Ready to fight.
He keeps one protective arm around Tracy. The creatures surround them.
Waiting for the right moment to attack. One of the creatures moves
forward. Another leaps behind Billy. Billy lunges forward and spears the
first creature. He quickly reels around, slicing the other creature in
two. Both creatures lie in the snow. Dead. Billy turns to the last
Mogwai. With two swings of his blade, he kills the creature. Billy wipes
the green blood off his sword with his coat sleeve. Breathless, he looks
at Tracy . Hair .hangs in his eyes. Blood runs down the side of his.
sweaty, unshaven face. His dark brown eyes stare at Tracy. The
transformation from meek bank clerk to sexy hero is complete. He
embraces her. They run to the police car and get inside. Billy’starts
the car. He and Tracy drive off into the night.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Hey, C’mon…</p>

guard rail, flips over a ditch and spins to a stop.</p>
<p><strong>billy’s car</strong>: Billy drives, as fast as possible
through the heavy snow. He’s headed out of town. Tracy sits beside him.
She looks out the window..</p>
<p><strong>outside</strong>: The rows of once peaceful, cheerful homes
are now the scenes of frenzied horror. People run out into the night,
screaming for help, only to be dragged to the ground by creatures.
Ravaged bodies lie in the snow. Frozen. An ambulance is overturned on
the roadside. Phone lines are town down. The creatures have made their
way across town. They now attack the last few houseson the block.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: looks away from her window. Tears fill her
eyes. She’s sickened by all of it. Billy holds Tracy’s hand, comforting
her.. Billy notices something.up ahead. He.stops the police car.</p>

<p><strong>outside</strong>: He closes the door. Tracy is safe inside.
Billy walks to the.sheriff’s car. He stays in the safety of the
headlight’s beam. Billy stops a few feet from the sheriff’s car. The
passenger side is crushed. The driver’s side is barely damaged, save for
a dented, jammed door. Gary pounds against-the door. He wants out. Billy
grabs the car handle. He pulls hard. The door pops open. He pulls Gary
out. Gary gets to his feet. He’s okay. Billy looks inside the car. Billy
closes the door.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: What.about my brother? Can we get him out?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He’s dead. Tears fill Gary’s eyes. Billy
leads Gary to the car.</p>

of the light. Gary walks. He looks scared. Helpless. They get to the
police car. Billy opens the door.</p>

kiss. Gary puts his arm around her.. Billy hops into the driver’s seat.
He rests the sword beside him.–He–starts the car and continues to
drive., Gary gives Tracy another kiss. He needs her comfort. Billy just
stares ahead, at the snowy road.</p>
<p><strong>dougal’s antique store - on the outskirts of town</strong>:
Closed.. But the upstairs lights are on. Someone is home. Everything
here looks calm. Untouched. Safe. The police car pulls into the
driveway.</p>
<p><strong>inside</strong>: Billy turns to Gary and Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’re just outside of town… Doesn’t look like
the creature’s got here yet. Let’s go inside and warm up. They exit the
police car.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: comes to the door. He sees the worn, hollow
faces of Gary and Tracy. He sees the bruised and bloodied Billy.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: What the hell happened to you? Billy looks at
Dorry.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: .and they originate from this marketplace in
Hong Kong. Dorrystands and shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: Hard to believe. Like Satan’s come to walk
the earth.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: You see…they’’re drawn to water. Now, if my
hunch is correct… They’ll be leaving town, and heading for the water
tower-which means they’ll have to pass by here tonight. We have to get
help. These things have to be kept under control. If they get to the
water tower .they could spread all over the St ate… maybe the Country.
They’re like inhuman divining rods.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Why didn’t you think of that before,
Peltzer?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I did. But nobody would listen.</p>
<p><strong>gary .</strong>: Maybe if you weren’t such a nut people would
believe you.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: Nowt boys…arguing won’t get us anywhere. Gary
still glares at Billy.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: This is your fau t, Peltzer.</p>

<p><strong>gary</strong>: You did it. You killed all those people..
You’re. a murderer, Peltzer. Billy lunges at Gary. They fall to the
ground. Fighting. Dorry and Tracy break it up.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: If we want to stay . alive… We have to stick
together. Billy turns away. Cooling off. Gary is comforted by Tracy. But
she keeps her eye on Billy. Dorry looks at everyone.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: We should get in touch with the
authorities.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Yeah, and then I’d like to try and get in
touch with my Dad. If we can…</p>
<p><strong>the lights go out.</strong>: Total darkness.</p>
<p><strong>living-room</strong>: Gary’s cigarette lighter illuminates
the room. Everyone stays quiet. They listen. THE GIGGLING of several
creatures echoes from outside.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: They’re here. A frightened Gary holds
Tracy.</p>
<p><strong>gary</strong>: Now what do we do? The giggling gets louder.
Closer. Billy turns to Dorry.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Do you have a place without win dows?… .A
place where we could be safe? Dorry pauses to think.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: The storage room The sound of breaking glass
is heard.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We have to hurry. Dorry leads everyone.out of
the.room…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: We’ll stay ere until daybreak. Gary sits with
Tracy on an old sofa. Dorry sits beside them in an�old rocking chair.

one disagrees. Tracy suddenly notices something. She cries out.</p>
<p>****: Billy!</p>
<p><strong>several creatures’ claws</strong>: scratch through the thin
wood of the storage room door. Thinking fast, Billy moves to a large
cabinet. He turns to Gary.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Help me with this. Gary and Billy slide the
cabinet in front of the door.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: That’llkeep them out. We’re safe now.. Billy
sits back. The �oipjs contipue. Dorrylook at ever y on</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: I’ve only been this scared two other times in

years old. It.was Christmas Eve. My sisters and I were decorating the
tree with our Mother. We were singing caroles…happy …excited… waiting
for Dad to get home from work. A few hours passed, and we started to
worry. Dad wasn’t home yet. My Mother called the office. They said he
left.</p>
<p>****: After about a week… the police gave up. My Mother was close to

<p>****: It was snowing outside. The house was cold. I threw some logs
on the fire.–..That’s when I noticed the smell. The firemen came. They
broke through the chimney top. We were all waiting, expecting them to
pull out some dead cat or bird… Instead, they pulled out my Father.</p>
<p>****: He was dressed in a Santa Claus suit. He had been climbing down
the chimney on Christmas Eve, his arms loaded with presents.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: He was going to surprise us.</p>
<p>****: The coroner said that he lost his footing. He slipped and broke
his neck. Died instantly. His body was lodged in the narrow chimney
shaft.</p>

chilled look on their faces. Dorry just stares. Billy stands and clears
his throat..</p>

sleep. I’ll watch the door. Everyone agrees. Billy moves his chair in

comforting smile.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: I just wanted to say thanks… I mean…If it
wasn’t for you, I don’t know what any of us would have done. Billy
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: is it okay if I sleep here? On the floor
beside you?…I’d feel a lot safer. Billy nods. Tracy moves a carpet next
to Billy’s chair. She lies on the carpet. She closes her eyes. Gary
watches from the sofa. Jealous.</p>
<p><strong>close-up - billy</strong>: The horror of it all finally hits
him. His eyes fill with tears. He cries. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: sleeping in his chair. His hand still holds
the sword on his lap. The others are asleep. Billy’s hand quivers. The
sword drops to the floor. He wakes. Startled. He quickly grabs the
sword. Everyone else wakes from the sound.</p>

<p><strong>billy</strong>: And-what happens when it gets dark? …And
you’re on the road. Alone. Gary says nothing.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. We have to stick together and fight these
things. At least until we can get help… Tracy folds her arms.</p>

cook.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: Could there be other people in town?
Alive?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s.possible. But it’s more important to get
at the creatures. We’ve got the advantage now. It’s daylight.</p>
<p><strong>gary i</strong>: You know where they are, Peltzer?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No…But they’re all gathered in one place. And
the sun rose before they could make it to the water tower. So they must
be holed up between here and there.</p>
<p><strong>tracy</strong>: The old church?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Too many windows. Too much light. it’s got to
be someplace dark. Totally dark.</p>
<p><strong>dorry</strong>: How about somebody’s garage?… Or tool

<p><strong>billy</strong>: No. There’s too many of them.. They’d need a
huge area…</p>
