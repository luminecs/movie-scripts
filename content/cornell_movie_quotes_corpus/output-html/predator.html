<h1 id="predator">predator</h1>
<p><strong>man</strong>: He’s here.</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: You’re looking well, Dutch.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: It’s been a long time, General.</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: We’ve got a real problem here, something
right up your alley.</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: Eighteen hours ago I was informed that one
of our choppers, transporting three presidential cabinet members from
this charming little country, was shot down… …The pilots radioed from
the ground that they were all alive. Their position was fixed by the
transponder beacon onboard the chopper. Here.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: That’s over the border, General.</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: That’s the problem. Apparently they strayed
off course. We’re certain they’ve been captured by the guerrillas.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What have you got in mind, General.</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: We figure we’ve got less than twenty-four
hours to catch up with them. After that, there’s not much hope. We want
a rescue operation mounted tonight. That doesn’t give you much time.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What else it new? When do we leave?</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: You lift off in three hours. There’s one
other thing.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What’s that, General?</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: Someone else will be going in with you.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You know we don’t work with outsiders,
General.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who said anything about outsiders, Dutch?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Last time we danced, it was Lieutenant,
Schaefer.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Dillon, you son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: How you been, Dutch?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You’ve been pushing too many Pencils,
Dillon. Had enough?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: No way, old buddy.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You never did know when to quit.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: That piece of work you guys pulled off at
the Berlin embassy last week was really something. Blew the entry points
on three floors and neutralized the opposition in eight seconds flat.
Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Like the old days, Dillon.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Also heard that you passed on that little
job in Libya.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Wasn’t my style. We’re a rescue unit, not
assassins. This must be good. Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to
come back to the bush. What’s so important?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Those cabinet members are very important to
our scope of operations in this part of the world. They’re about to get
squeezed. We can’t let that happen. I needed someone who could get the
job done, quick and quiet…no screw-ups. I needed the best. The best. So,
I pulled a few strings at the State Department…and here we are.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: The set-up is simple, Dutch. One day job. We
pick up their trail at the chopper, run ’em down, grab the hostages and
bounce back across the border before anyone knows we were there. You’ve
done it a hundred times. Nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: And nothing we can’t handle alone.</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: I’m afraid those are your orders, Major.
Once you reach your objective, Dillon will evaluate the situation and
take charge.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Not to worry, Dutch. I haven’t lost my edge.
They’ve got a head start on us in some real tough country, otherwise,
believe me, it’s a piece of cake.</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: Gentlemen, we’re losing time. You’d better
get your men ready. Good luck, Major.</p>
<p><strong>pilot one</strong>: Redbird Two, Two. Bearing south, three,
five, zero, one o’ckock on the saddle ridge. Over.</p>
<p><strong>pilot two</strong>: Roger, Blue Leader. Three, five, zero, on
your move. Over.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Hey, Billy, how many marines does it take
to eat a squirrel?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Two. One to eat it and one to watch for
cars.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Get that stinkin’ thing out of my face,
Blain!</p>
<p><strong>blain</strong>: …bunch of slack-jawed faggots around here…
…this stuff will put hair guaranteed… …make you a God-damned sexual
ty-ran-toe-sore-ass… just like me.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Our rendezvous points and radio freqs. are
indicated and fixed. AWACS contact on four hour intervals.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Who’s our back-up on this?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: No such thing, old buddy. It’s a one way
ticket. Once we cross that border, we’re on our own.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: This gets better by the minute.</p>
<p><strong>pilot number one</strong>: …roger Bird Two, Two. Reconfirm
insertion at Tango, Charlie, Delta One, zero, niner on the grid at zero,
two, two, mark four by zero. Over.</p>
<p><strong>pilot number two</strong>: Two, Two, leader. Roger your
insert co-ord. Over.</p>
<p><strong>pilot number one</strong>: Leader to Bird Two Two. I bear two
minutes to Landing Zone.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Man, that’s a real bad habit you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>pilot number one</strong>: LZ comin’ up in 30 seconds. Stand
by the rappel lines.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: You don’t know how much I missed this,
Dutch!!! Once you get this in your blood, you never get it out!!!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You never were all that smart…let’s
go!!!</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: The pilots have each got one round in the
head. And whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Took ’em out with a heat seeker.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: There’s something else, Major…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Mmmnnn…?</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: I don’t think that was any ordinary army
taxi…</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: …looks more like a surveillance bird to
me.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Have you picked up their trail yet?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Billy’s on it. Heat seeker. Pretty
sophisticated for half-asses mountain boys.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: They’re getting better equipped every
day.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Major, looks like there were ten, maybe
twelve guerrillas. Looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.
Then a different set of track, over there.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Six others, U.S. issue jungle boots. They
came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Probably another rebel patrol. They operate
in here all the time.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Get ahead, see what you can find. Slow and
easy.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What’s he got?</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Same business, guerrillas hauling two guys
from the chopper…followed by men with American equipment…</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Holy Mother…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: J.S. Davis, Captain, U.S. Army…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Mac. Cut them down.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: I knew this man. Green Berets, out of Fort
Bragg. What the hell were they doing in here? You got any answers for
this, Dillon?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Jesus…this is inhuman. Uh…I wasn’t told of
any operations in this area. They shouldn’t have been here.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Well somebody sent them.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Must have run into the guerrillas …Fucking
animals.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Ain’t no way for a soldier to die. Time to let
‘ol ’painless’ out of the bag.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What happened here, Billy?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Strange, Major. There was a firefight.
Shooting in all directions.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: I can’t believe Jim Hopper walked into an
ambush.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I don’t believe he did, Sir. I couldn’t find
a single track. Just doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What about the rest of Hopper’s men?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: No sign. They never left here Major. It’s
like they just disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Stick with the guerilla trail. Let’s get
it over with. We move. Five meter spread. No sound. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>blain</strong>: Payback time.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: You’re ghostin’ on me, mother fokaaa!…I don’t
care who you are back in the world… You give away our position again and
I’ll bleed you quiet and leave your fuckin’ ass right here. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>blain</strong>: Say, Bull. What’s goin’ down? We got
movement?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: No. Shithead with his trenchcoat and
dee-coda-da ring was makin’ enough noise to get us all waxed. I don’t
like that guy. Don’t like him at my back. I ain’t winding up like those
bastards back there.</p>
<p><strong>blain</strong>: I know what you mean, Bull, but don’t sweat
it, me and ‘ol ’painless’ here are watchin’ the front door.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: As always, bro…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Just killed one of the prisoners. No time
for invitations. We take them, now.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Ready, kid?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: On your nine!!!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Stick around.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Down!!!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Hawk, Get Con. Op. on the hook! Position
and situation, now!</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: You got it, Major!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Any sign of the hostages?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We found ‘em both, dead. And the gear from the
chopper. If they’re Central American, I’m a fuckin’ Chinaman. By the
looks of ’em, I’d say our cabinet minister and his aide are CIA. Another
thing, Major, we were lucky…couple of those guys we waxed are Russians,
military advisors by the look of it. Something big was about to happen
here.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Good work, Mac. Clear the area, no traces.
Get the men ready to move.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Shit…</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: You’re hit. You’re bleedin’, man.</p>
<p><strong>blain</strong>: Ain’t got time to bleed.</p>
<p><strong>blain</strong>: Son of a bitch’s dug in like a Alabama tick…
…jack us around all day.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Hell, dude, we don’t have all day.</p>
<p><strong>blain</strong>: Shit, Pancho!!!</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: What’s your problem, dude?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: This is beautiful! More than we ever
thought. We got the bastards!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: I think this is the one you want.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Two days…that’s all we had. In two days,
three hundred of these bastards would have been equipped with all this.
After they crossed the border, it would have taken a year to stop them.
We’ve averted a major guerrilla invasion, Dutch…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: It was all bullshit. All of it. From the
start…you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: That’s right, I set you up. You’re a veteran
at this, Dutch, I had to.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Why us?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Because I told you, you’re the best. I knew
you could do it but I couldn’t get you in here without a cover
story.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What story did you give to Davis?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: We’ve been lookin’ for this place for
months. The chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down.
Hopper was sent in to get my men. He was just doing his job. When he
disappeared I had to clean this up, I had to stop there bastards. We
were so close, we couldn’t quit. We couldn’t sleep through this one. I
needed you, Dutch, can’t you see that?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: To invade a foreign country, illegally? You
lied, Dillon. Stacked the odds against us. Set us up. You could have
gotten us all killed. You used to be one of us, Dillon, someone I could
trust with my life…</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: We’ve been through a lot together Dutch.
When we were together, no one could stop us, the hottest Goddamned team
the army ever saw. But things changed, I woke up. We’re fighting them in
a dozen Goddamned countries. It’s a fight we can’t lose, Dutch. We’re
all expendable assets, can’t you see that?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: That’s your problem, Dillon. You always
did put ambition before the lives of your men. My men are not
expendable. I don’t do this kind of work. This is your dirty little war,
not mine.</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Major!</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Major, we stepped into some real shit here.
I got a hook-up with aerial surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Movement?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Guerrillas swarming like flies all over the
place. Can’t be more then one, maybe two miles away. Place is going
down, Major.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: How much time?</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Half an hour, maybe less.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Tell Mac we move in five.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: She goes with us.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: She’s too valuable. She’s got to know their
whole network. The whole set up. We take her with us.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: We take her and she’ll give away our
position, every chance she gets. No prisoners, Dillon.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: You’re still under orders, Dutch. You want
to make the call, or should I?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: I’m getting my men out of this damn
jungle, Dillon. She’s your baggage. You fall behind, you’re on your
own.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: This place is too hot for a pick-up. They
won’t touch us until we’re over the border. We can lift at LZ 49, here.
Spotter plane says we’re cut off. Except for this valley.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Looks bad, Major. It’s gonna be a real bitch.
If we follow above the river and then down, here, at this canyon, we
might find a way out.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Not much choice. Pancho, take the lead.
Double time it.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Lock n’ load, watch your ass.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You touch me again, pig, and I will cut off
your balls!</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: It’s a long walk back, make it easy on
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Hey, Dillon, over here.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Dillon, over here.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Yeah, what is it, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: When my people catch you, you’ll wish you were
him.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Dillon, over here.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Dillon, over here.</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Dillon, over here.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’ve seen some badass bush before, but nothin’
like this, man. Little taste ’o home?</p>
<p><strong>blain</strong>: I hear you bro, this is some shit. Makes
Cambodia look like Kansas. Lose your way in here, man, you be in some
kinda hurt.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Shit. Come on…</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Don’t try it.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: You should put her on a leash, Agent Man.
If you can’t handle her, just say the word.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Try that again. Please.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Watch her.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What’s got Billy so spooked?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Can’t say, Major…been squirrely all mornin’…
fuckin’ weird…sometimes I think that nose of his is too good…smells
things that ain’t there.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What is it…?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Billy…What the hell’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Something…in the trees…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Can you see anything… …there?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: It’s…nothing…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What do you think…?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: It’s nothing…</p>
<p><strong>hawkins</strong>: Please…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Look out, behind you!!!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: It’s not her blood.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Major, you’d better take a look at
this.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Hawkins?</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: I can’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What in God’s name…?</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: I think it’s Hawkins.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Where the hell is his body?</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: There’s no sign of it.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Ramirez, ask her what happened.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: She says…the jungle came alive, and took
him…</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: That isn’t what she said… she said… …she
doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Couple of sappers been trailing us all the
way from the camp, Major. Billy heard them. She set us up, ran for
it…They were waiting. I should’ve wasted the bitch when I had the
chance.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Why didn’t they take the radio and his
weapon? Why didn’t she escape?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: They did the same thing to Davis…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: I want him found. Sweep pattern and double
back. Fifty meters.</p>
<p><strong>blain</strong>: Come on in you fuckers…come on in. ‘ol
’painless’ is waitin’…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Contact, 30 Right!!!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I…saw it.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You saw what?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I saw it.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Blain… …Just like the others…no powder
burns, no shrapnel.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: The wound all fused, cauterized…what the
hell did this?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: …Mac!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Mac! Mac! Look at me!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Mac, who did this?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I don’t know. Goddamn it, something…I saw
something/.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Nothing. The same thing. Not a fucking
trace. No bodies, blood, anything.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: We’re losing the light. Mac, I want a
defensive position above this ridge, mined with everything we’re
got.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Yessir.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Put him in his poncho and liner and carry
him back. We’ll bury him in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’ll take him.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: We’ve got most of the flares, frags. and two
claymores just outside. Nothin’s comin’ close to here without trippin’
on somethin’.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Thank you, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: I’m sorry, Bull. It’s never easy. He was a
good soldier.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: The best friend I ever had.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Good-bye, Bro.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Blazer One, say again…</p>
<p><strong>blazer one</strong>: Red Fox, I say again. Your request for
extraction denied. Your area still compromised. Proceed to Sector 3000
for prisoner extraction, Priority Alpha. Next contact at 1030 hours.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Roger, Blazer One. 1030 hours…damn,
bastards.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: We’re still too far in, they won’t risk
coming in for us.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley
is never around when you need them.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: I can accept that, it comes with the
job.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Bullshit. You’re just like the rest of
us.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Shit load o’ good a chopper’d do us in here
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Mac. Who hit us today?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Don’t know, only saw one of ’em. Camouflaged.
He was there… …Those fucking eyes…</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: What, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Those eyes…disappeared. But I know one thing,
Major… …I drew down and fired right at it. Capped-off two hundred rounds
and then the Mini-gun; the full pack. Nothin’…nothin’ on this earth
could have lived…not at that range.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: I’ve got the first watch.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Ask her again. What did she see? What
happened to Hawkins?</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: She says the same thing… It was the
jungle…</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: You know something Billy, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Bullshit. You ain’t afraid of no man.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: There’s something out there, waiting for
us…it ain’t no man.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: He’s losing his cool. There’s nothing out
there but a couple of men that we’re going to have to take down.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You still don’t get it, do you Dillon? He
took Davis… and now he wants us.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: It’s the same kinda jungle, Bro, same moon…
everything… …a real number ten night. Remember Bro? Only you and me, the
only one’s out of the whole fuckin’ platoon who made it out.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …we walked out on top of ‘em. Not a scratch,
not a fuckin’ scratch. No fuckin’ chili-choker got to you, Bro…you were
just too good…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …I promise you this, Bro… whoever he is, I hope
he’s plannin’ to hit us again… …’cause he’s got my name on ’em.</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Got the motherfucker…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: A pig…just a fucking pig…</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Holy shit, Mac.</p>
<p>****: ————————————————————————</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Get a field dressing on that right
away.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Where’s the girl?</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Major, over here.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: The body…it’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Came in through the trip wires, took it
right out from under our noses…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Boar set off the trip flare, Major. No other
tracks.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: How could anyone get through this, carry
Blain out, right under our noses without leavin’ a trace?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: He knows our defenses.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: Why didn’t he try to kill one of us last
night?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: He came back for the body. He’s killing
us, one at a time…</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: Like a Hunter.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: He uses the trees.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Yesterday. What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: You’re wastin’ your time.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: No more games.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know what it was. It…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It changes colors, like the chameleon. It uses
the jungle…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: What’s you name?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Anna.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Anna. He’s hunting us. You know that?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: What the hell do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: We’re going to need everyone.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: What are you talking about? We’ll be out of
here in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: We’re not going.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: That rendezvous is ten maybe twelve miles,
at most! We’re almost home. But the chopper won’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Dillon…This thing doesn’t care who we are,
who she is. We make a stand or there won’t be anyone left to make that
chopper.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: There is something else. When the big man was
killed, you must have wounded it. It’s blood was on the leaves.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: If it bleeds, we can kill it.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: I’m tellin’ you, this little ‘boy scout’
stunt is a Godamned waste of time. We’ve got to get the hell out of
here, now, while we’ve still got the chance.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: He’ll be looking for the trip wires. If
we’re lucky, he won’t see this.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Now what, Dutch. You going to send your
mystery guest an invitation?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You’re catching on, Dillon.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: When I was little we find a man – – like a
butcher. The old ones in the village cross themselves and whisper crazy
things. ‘Demonio, cazador de trofoes…Only the hottest times of the
hottest years…’ Crazy things…This year is grows hot. And we begin
finding our men. We find them sometimes without their skin.
Sometimes…much, much worse. Cazador de trofoes…means the demon who takes
trophies.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: What’ll you try next – cheese?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Satisfied? Now let’s get the hell out…</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: What is God’s name…?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Mac!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Get Ramirez on his feet! Take the girl and
get the hell out of here!</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: No way, Dutch. I’m going. You get these
people and get the hell out of here.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: This isn’t your style, Dillon.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Guess I’ve picked up some bad habits from
you, Dutch. Now don’t argue with me, you know I’m right. Get to that
chopper and hold it for us. We’ll be along.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You know you can’t win this one.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: You know me, Dutch, I never did know when to
quit.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Dillon!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: I’ll see you there.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Right behind you.</p>
<p><strong>billy</strong>: He’s busted up, bad, Major.</p>
<p><strong>ramirez</strong>: I can make it, Major.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Come on, Poncho, we’re getting out of
here. Billy, take the radio, leave the rest. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Come on, you motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dillon, over here.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Dillon, over here.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Mac?</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: Out there. Past the rocks… can you see it?</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: I see it! We’re gonna take this thing.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Take a position over there. I’ll work around
towards you. When I flush him, you nail him…</p>
<p><strong>mac</strong>: …Right, I got a score to settle for the
Bro…</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: We both got scores to settle.</p>
<p><strong>dillon</strong>: Mac…Mac.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Billy!!!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Billy!!!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Get back, into the rocks!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Run! Get to the chopper!</p>
<p>****: ————————————————————————</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: You couldn’t see me.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: One chance, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>anna’s voice</strong>: Look out, behind you!!!</p>
<p><strong>anna’s voice</strong>: …Look out, behind you!</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Anna…?</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Anna…?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Dillon, over here…</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Bleed, you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>schaefer</strong>: Who the hell are you…?</p>
<p><strong>hunter</strong>: Who… …the hell… …are… …You?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Holy, fuck, what was that…?!!!</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: Orbit right…check it out!</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Looks like he’s been through hell…can’t
believe he’s still alive. What the hell went on down there?</p>
<p><strong>philips</strong>: If it hadn’t been for her, he’d be dead
now. That story she told us…I still can’t believe it.</p>
