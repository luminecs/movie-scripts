<h1 id="angels--demons">angels-&amp;-demons</h1>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: – the Ring of the Fisherman, which bears
the official papal seal and by Vatican law must be destroyed immediately
following the Pope’s death.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The Pope’s Chamberlain, or “Camerlengo,”
then seals the papal apartments —</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: — “the time of the empty throne.”</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Somebody pulled us off the grid,
Phillipe.</p>
<p><strong>phillipe</strong>: You hit 36kV down there yesterday. The
whole synchrotron only loads 18.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: And the LEAR’s specked up to 42. It’s all
approved by the Director, you want me to call him?</p>
<p><strong>phillipe</strong>: Waste of power, what’re you extracting,
still ten to the seventh APs a second? How long to produce a gram at
that rate?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: About two billion years. At that rate.</p>
<p><strong>phillipe</strong>: Vittoria.</p>
<p>****: Please don’t blow us all to heaven.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Following the elegy Mass, the body of the
pontiff, borne by the traditional twelve pall bearers will be sealed in
a zinc crypt deep in the Vatican Grottoes along with the bodies of
twenty-five other popes.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Beam on beam collisions are active.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: — the Pope’s elegy Mass, led by Cardinal
Saverio Mortati, Dean of the College of Cardinals —</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Power should be back five by five.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: It is, extraction’s already started.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: The College of Cardinals will lock itself
in the Sistine Chapel for Conclave literally, the word means “with key”
– the process by which the Church chooses a new leader for the world’s
one billion Catholics.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: Professor Langdon?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Swim might help your jet lag.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p>****: Bags under your eyes, up at five a.m., Italian accent… Do I
hear Naples in those Rs?</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: Claudio Vincenzo, Corpo della Gendarmeria
Vaticano.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Vatican Police? I was expecting another
letter. My request for access to the Archives?</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: In fact I was in New York, on vacation. I
got a call in the middle of the night — find Robert Langdon. A matter of
great urgency.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Urgent Vatican business, involving me? I
doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: They said to show you this.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: llluminati?</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: Yes, of course, but it couldn’t be the
llluminati as we knew them, they disappeared a hundred years ago.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Did they? Look at the paper.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: I’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Look again.</p>
<p>****: Which is why you’re here, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: “The Art of the llluminati,” by Robert
Langdon.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Incredible. Either someone just figured out
how to make this, or they found it. Recently. Which would mean the
llluminati have returned. An ancient brotherhood, enemies of the church,
surfacing just after the death of a Pope? I’d pull you off vacation
too.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: It’s worse than just that. Four cardinals
were kidnapped from their quarters inside the Vatican some time between
three and five a.m. this morning. Shortly afterward, the Office of the
Swiss Guard received that document, along with the threat that the
Cardinals will be publicly executed, one per hour, starting at seven
p.m. tonight, in Rome.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Conclave?</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: Was to begin today. We have postponed its
start for a few hours, a story of illness, there are no suspicions.
Yet.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: What do you want from me?</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: The perpetrators of this heinous act sent
that – ambigram, you say? – as a provocation, a taunt. But it may also
be their undoing. If you can help us learn their identity, perhaps we
can stop them.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: Your expertise. Your erudition. And your
involvement with recent Church – shall we say “mysteries?”</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I wasn’t under the impression that episode
had endeared me to the Vatican.</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: Oh, it didn’t. But it made you – what is
the word? Formidable. Formidable. A plane is standing by twenty minutes
from here. Will you come with me?</p>
<p><strong>vincenzo</strong>: If the llluminati have returned and are in
Rome, we will hunt them down and kill them.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Spoken like a Roman Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: Commandante Rocher assures me the Guard
is doing everything humanly possible to find the prefiriti.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: A very long way for him to say very
little.</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: What if you were to begin in their
absence?</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: They are the four leading candidates. If
they’re not present, they’re not eligible. There will be no consensus
without them, wid are we to vote for?</p>
<p>****: The Camerlengo asks how long you can postpone the opening
prayer without making another announcement to the public?</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Two years and three months. The conclave of
1316?</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: He’s be concerned about the public
dimension. People will think-</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: What we tell them to think.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Professor Langdon, welcome to Vatican
City. Ernesto Olivetti, Inspector Generale of the Vatican Police
Force.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I assumed you were Swiss Guard.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: No. The Gendarmerie is responsible for
everything inside the Vatican walls, with the exception of the security
of His Holiness and the Apostolic Palace. That is Swiss Guard. The
Commandante Generale of the Roman Carbinieri has joined us as well, in
an advisory capacity, and the Guarda Nacionale have sent a
representative.</p>
<p>****: So jurisdictionally, this is-</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: A God damn nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Great Castration.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: 1857. Pius IX felt the male form might
inspire lust, so he got a hammer and chisel and unmanned two hundred
statues. These plaster fig leaves were added later.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Are you anti-Catholic, Professor
Langdon?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Me? No, I’m anti-vandalism.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: I urge you to guard your tone in there.
The Swiss Guard is a calling, not a profession, and it encourages a
certain – zealotry. Commander Rocher, the head of the Guard, is a deeply
spiritual man, and he was close to the late Pope. Understood?</p>
<p>****: I just hope I can help.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: So do I. You were my idea.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Ms. Vetra? I’m Commander Rocher, Commandante
Principale of the Swiss Guard. Thank you for coming. And Professor
Langdon?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: That’s right. Rocher looks him up and down,
so, you’re Langdon.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Thank God, the symbologist is here.
Ms. Vetra, this way, please.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: There’s been a development. We received
another threat from the kidnapper.</p>
<p>****: – canister was stolen from our lab around midnight last night.
The intruder killed my research partner, Leonardo Bentivoglio, and
mutilated him in order to bypass security.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: I’m quite familiar with incendiaries,
Ms. Vetra. I haven’t heard of antimatter.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: It’s new, energy research technology. It
uses a reverse polarity vacuum to filter out anti-matter positrons
generated in particle accelerations in the Large Hadron Collider at
CERN.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: And what might cause it to fall out of
suspension?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: The battery going dead. Which it will. In
six hours and eleven minutes.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: It’s wireless. It too was stolen. That
could be anywhere inside the Vatican walls.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: You’ve got to find it.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: We’re a bit preoccupied with four missing
cardinals at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: You don’t understand. An annihilation is a
cataclysmic event. It would be a blinding explosion, equivalent to about
five megatons. The blast radius alone would be –</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: “Vatican City will be consumed by
light.”</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Those are the exact words the kidnapper
used.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We will destroy your four pillars… brand your
preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science… and then bring
your church down upon you. Vatican City will be consumed by light.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: It’s an ancient llluminati threat. The
destruction of Vatican City through light. The four pillars – he
probably means the kidnapped cardinals. You didn’t mention they were the
preferiti. The favorites to be chosen as the new Pope. Play it
again.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: We will destroy your four pillars… brand your
preferiti and sacrifice them on the altars of science…</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Stop it there.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: He said they’d be killed publicly. In
churches.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Revenge for La Purga.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: La Purga?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Don’t you guys read your own history? 1668.
The church kidnapped four llluminati scientists and branded their chests
with the symbol of the cross. To “purge their sins.” Murdered them and
left their bodies in the street as a warning to others to stop
questioning church rulings on scientific matters. It was after La Purga
that a darker, more violent llluminati emerged. This sounds like
retribution. Is there any more?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: …. and then bring your church down upon you.
Vatican City will be consumed by light…</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Path of Illumination?</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Professor, this is not the appropriate
moment to-</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Your petition has been denied seven times,
Mr. Langdon.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: This has nothing to do with that,</p>
<p>****: The Path of Illumination is an ancient trail through Rome that
leads to the Church of the Illumination, a secret place where llluminati
members could meet in safety. If I can find the Segno, the sign that
marks the start of the Path, I’m willing to bet the four churches along
it are where he intends to murder your cardinals. If we can get to one
of them before he does, we can stop it. But to find the start of the
path, I need to get into the Archives.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Even if I wanted to help you, access is only
by written decree of the curator and the Board of Vatican
Librarians.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Or by papal mandate.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Yes. But as you’ve no doubt heard, the Holy
Father is-</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: What about Il Camerlengo? Let me talk to
him.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: The Camerlengo? He’s just a priest here, the
former Pope’s Chamberlain.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Doesn’t the power of the Holy See rest with
him during tempe sede vacante?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: His Holiness once told me that a Pope is
a man torn between two worlds… the real world and the divine.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Of course, but it could be anywhere, and the
safety of the cardinals is my primary concern at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: The Sistine Chapel is a fortress, as
long as the cardinals are in conclave, your security concerns are at a
minimum. Devote as much of your resources as possible to a search
for-</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Signore, if you’re about to suggest we make
a naked-eye search of all of Vatican City, I must-</p>
<p>****: Commander. Though I am not His Holiness, when you address me,
you are addressing this office. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Yes, Padre,</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Good. Now – you said the image on screen
was illuminated by artificial light. May I suggest methodically cutting
the power to various sections of the City. When the image on your screen
goes dark, you’ll have a more specific idea of the device’s
location.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Only the director of CERN. But Leonardo
kept detailed journals; if he told anyone else about what we were doing,
he would have made a note of it.</p>
<p>****: Do you have these journals?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I can have them flown here from Geneva in
an hour.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Mr. Langdon. You’re correct that I may
grant you access to the Archives.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Thank you, Padre.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: I said you’re correct that I may, not
that I will. Christianity’s most sacred codices are in that archive.
Given your recent entanglement with the church – I need to ask you a
question first.</p>
<p>****: Father, I simply believe that religions can often-</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: I didn’t ask if you believe what man
says about God, I asked if you believe in God.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I’m an academic. My mind tells me I will
never understand God.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: And your heart?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Tells me I’m not meant to.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Be delicate with our treasures.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: The archives are this way.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Professor Langdon!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: “A shining star at the end of the Path.” My
thoughts exactly.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: If we find this bomb, can you deactivate
it?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: No, but I can change its battery, as long
as it has more than five minutes of life. That would give us another
twenty-four hours to get it back to</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Both. You’re a physicist?</p>
<p>****: Bio-entanglement physics. Interconnectivity of life
systems.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: What are we looking for in the
archives?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: A little book written by Galileo.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Galileo was llluminati?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: And a devout Catholic. He thought science
and religion weren’t enemies, but two different languages telling the
same story. He wanted like minds to be able to find the Church of
Illumination, but he couldn’t exactly advertise its location, so he
created a coded path. An unknown llluminati master sculpted four
statues, each a tribute to one of the four fundamental elements – earth,
air, fire, water – and put them out in public, in churches throughout
Rome. Each statue held a clue, pointing to the next. And at the end of
the trail was the Church of Illumination.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: What makes you think he’s going to murder
the cardinals in the churches?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The llluminati called those four churches
by a special name – L’Altare di scienza. The altars of science.</p>
<p>****: “Sacrifice them on the altars of science,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Oh. Oh, wow.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Vatican Police aren’t allowed access to
the archives, only Swiss Guard. Lt. Chartrand will meet you inside. I’ll
be here when you’re done.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: You’ve been informed of the new
situation?</p>
<p>****: May God’s mercy be upon us.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: And the other cardinals?</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Await your word.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: May I ask your guidance, Padre?</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: My belief is we should proceed with the
sealing of conclave.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: At this hour? That would be highly
unorthodox.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: And yet within church law. It’s in my
power, I’ve been chosen Great Elector.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: The cruelest honor in Christendom.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: The only ambitions I have are for my
church. St. Peter’s church, which is under attack at its most vulnerable
moment. This is not a coincidence. Is it possible our enemies hope to
distract us from our sacred task?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: The church will not fall in a day. We
may be wise to consider evacuation.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: That is exactly what they want, publicity
and panic. We must not give them oxygen for the media fire.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: What of the safety of the cardinals?</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Surely there is not an elector present who
values his physical being more than the unbroken leadership of the Holy
See.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: And the people in St. Peter’s
Square?</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: They care as deeply about their church as
we do. Their faith will sustain them.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: But if their faith does not protect them
from an explosion?</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: We’re all bound for heaven eventually, are
we not?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Spoken like one who has enjoyed the
blessings of a long and full life.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Signore, do not confuse the power of the
office you temporarily hold with your true place here in the Vatican.
You were a favorite of His Holiness, but His Holiness is with his Father
now.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Mea culpa.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Seal the doors.</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: The chambers are hermetic vaults, oxygen
is kept at lowest possible levels. It’s a partial vacuum inside. More
than ten minutes in the vault is not recommended without breathing
apparatus.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Take a moment. If you feel double vision,
double over.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Feels like I’m… scuba diving… with the
wrong mixture.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Plenty of time.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: You have no idea what you’re missing.</p>
<p><strong>lamasse</strong>: Conclave will go on without us. The voice
of God will not be silenced.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: I was referring to my tea. Last chance,
I’d be happy to make you a cup.</p>
<p><strong>lamasse</strong>: May God forgive you for what you’ve
done.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: Father, if God has issues they won’t be
with what I’ve done – – but with what I’m about to do.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: – confiscated from the Netherlands by the
Vatican shortly after Galileo’s death. I’ve been petitioning to see it
for almost ten years. Ever since I realized what was in it.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: What makes you so sure the Segno is
there?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The number 503. I kept seeing it over and
over in llluminati letters, scribbled in the margins, or sometimes just
signed that way, “503.” It’s a numerical clue, but to what? Five, of
course, is the sacred llluminati number – the pentagram, Pythagoras, a
dozen other examples in science – but why three?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: D3. Galileo’s third text. Dialogo.
Discorsi.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Diagramma della Verita. The Diagram of
Truth.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I know about Dialogo and Discorsi –
Galileo laid out his theories about the earth revolving around the sun,
and the church forced him to recant. But what was this?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: This is where he got the word out. The
truth, not what the Vatican forced him to write. Smuggled out of Rome
and printed in Holland on sedge papyrus. That way any scientists caught
with a copy could simply drop it in water and the booklet would
dissolve.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: A bit.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Finger acids.</p>
<p>****: Movement of the planets… elliptical orbits…
heliocentricity…</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Do that again.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: English? Why English?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: No one spoke it at the Vatican. It was
considered polluted. Too free- thinking, the language of radicals like
Shakespeare and Chaucer.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Sorry, Professor. No time.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Ah, what the hell.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Twenty minutes till eight, where are we
headed?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I’ll know in a minute, give me the
paper.</p>
<p>****: From Santi’s earthly tomb with demon’s hole…</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Where did you get that paper?!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: ’Cross Rome the mystic elements unfold.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: We borrowed it.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The path of light is laid, the sacred
test…</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Are you insane?!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Let angels guide you on your earthly
quest.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: You removed a document from the Vatican
Archives?!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Huh? Oh, um – well, she moved so
fast.�.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: The first marker sounds like it’s at
Santi’s tomb.</p>
<p>****: Sounds like.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: But who is Santi?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Raphael.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Raphael? The sculptor?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Santi was his last name.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: So the path starts at Raphael’s tomb!</p>
<p>****: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Raphael is buried at the Pantheon.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Is the Pantheon even a church?</p>
<p>****: Oldest Catholic church in Rome!</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: I’ve just pulled a dozen of my best men from
Vatican City during conclave and left the search for the antimatter
device in the hands of secondary officers. You’d better be right.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I believe I am.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: The Pantheon is one of the busiest tourist
spots in Rome, how could he hope to get away with it? It’s
impossible.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: As impossible as kidnapping four cardinals
from Vatican City? The poem is precise.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: The poem. Unbelievable. I’m basing this
operation on an American’s interpretation of a four hundred year old
poem.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: The information we have clearly refers to
Raphael’s tomb, and Raphael’s tomb is inside that building.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Pantheon is your one chance to catch
this guy.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: One? I thought you said four. A pathway,
four markers. We’ll have four chances to catch him.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: You would have, a hundred years ago. The
Vatican had all the pagan statues in the Pantheon removed and destroyed
in the late 1800s. Whatever marker was there to lead us to the next
church is gone now. The path is dead. This is your chance.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Separate approaches. Cars to Piazza della
Rotunda, Via degli Orfani, Piazza Sant’Ignazio, and Sant1Eustachio. No
closer than two blocks, no uniforms, three minutes. Understood?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Wait a minute, you’ll scare him off.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: They’re not in uniform.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I’m sorry, two weightlifters in matching
black suits and earpieces, they’re hardly disguised.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: There’s no time to get undercover men
here.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Fine. I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: I’m not sending a wom-</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Tourists have cell phones, don’t they? Hi
honey, I’m at the Pantheon, you should see this place!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: You can’t send her in there alone.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: I don’t intend to.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: You’re crushing my hand.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: A nervous newlywed?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Ancient newlywed.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Try harder.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: You really know how to use that gun gave
you?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I can tag a breaching porpoise from forty
meters off the bow of a rocking ship.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Thought you said you were a physicist,</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I am. Long story.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Make it short.</p>
<p>****: Can’t be done. What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Seven minutes to eight.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Was that Mickey Mouse?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Long story.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Make it short.</p>
<p>****: Can’t be done.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The oculus. That could be the “demon’s
hole” in the poem.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Why are the tombs at an angle?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: To face east. Sun worship.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: But this is a Christian church.</p>
<p>****: New religions often adopt existing holidays to make conversion
less shocking. December 25th was the pagan holiday of the Unconquered
Sun. Made it a handy choice for Christ’s birthday.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: You’re saying Christianity is repackaged
sun worship?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Where do you think halos came from? Not
just sun worship though, the Catholics borrowed Communion from the
Aztecs, canonization from Euphemerus, the cruciform from the Egyptians
—</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: No wonder they don’t like you around
here.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Just trying to keep the conversation
lively.</p>
<p>****: Check the recesses. I’ll go left. See you in a hundred eighty
degrees.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Raphael’s tomb! But –</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: What are you talking about?!</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: He was moved here, in 1759. A century
after Diagramma was published!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: That’s not possible, the poem said-</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Where was he originally buried?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I don’t know… Urbino, I think… Santi’s
earthly tomb… what else could it possibly… Santi ’s tomb…</p>
<p><strong>docent</strong>: Does anyone have any questions?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Yes! Did Raphael Santi ever design a chapel
with an ossuary annex and angel figure commissioned by the Catholic
Church?!</p>
<p><strong>docent</strong>: I’m sorry, I… I can only think of one.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: One’ll do.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Wrong? What do you mean, wrong?!</p>
<p>****: The first altar of science is the Chigi Chapel, in the church
of Santa Maria del Popolo, about a mile from here! It used to be called
Capella della Terra, Chapel of the Earth. Earth, the first element! This
is it, I’m certain.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: You were certain of the Pantheon.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Please, we have four minutes!</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Back to the Vatican?! You can’t!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Commandante, if you care at all about your
church-</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: My church? My church feeds the hungry,
comforts the sick and dying. What does your church do, Professor? Ah,
that’s right, you haven’t one.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: This is the place.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: The Freemasons? Are Illuminati?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Illuminati were infiltrators. There
isn’t a powerful organization on earth they didn’t place members in.
Look at a dollar bill some time. A pyramid, an occult symbol
representing convergence upward, with the eye of illumination above it,
and beneath it the Latin for “New World Order.”</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: The United States government was
infiltrated by Illuminati?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: FDR’s vice-president was a high- ranking
Freemason. Convinced him the words in Latin actually meant “New
Deal.”</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Eight o’clock!</p>
<p>****: No, no, it’s an annulus!</p>
<p>****: The chapel is in one of those apses.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Pyramids. In a Catholic church. This is
it.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Anybody got a flashlight?</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Can you tell what it is?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Not from up here.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: More or less.</p>
<p>****: I call as my witness Christ the Lord, who will be my judge that
my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be
elected.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Eligo in summum pontificem –</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: The first ballot has failed.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Get that body out of there and search the
rest of the building.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Earthly symbology… everywhere…</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Why the hell didn’t you figure this out in
the first place?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Is it Raphael?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The chapel is. But the sculptures are
Bernini.</p>
<p>****: The unknown Illuminati master was Bernini.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Didn’t he work for the Church?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Almost exclusively. It means the Illuminati
even infiltrated the Vatican. They hid in plain sight.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Habakkuk?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The prophet who predicted the annihilation
of the earth. This is the first marker.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Southwest… it points southwest…</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: You’re sure this time?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I need a map. One that shows all the
churches in Rome.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Robert!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The black rectangles with crosses are
churches, and none of them intersect the line until it comes to an end,
right in the middle of St. Peter’s Square.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Your theory doesn’t hold up, Professor.
Michelangelo designed St. Peter’s, not Bernini.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Basilica is Michelangelo, but the
square is Bernini. The second marker must be a statue in the square.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: It’s ten minutes till nine! Can we go any
faster?!</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Not unless we want the full attention of the
world press.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Another obelisk. We’re close.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: There must be a hundred statues up there,
which one is it?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: How in God’s name would anyone make a
sculpture about air?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: He’s still alive!</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Clear the square.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: When did this call come in?</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Three, four minutes ago. The same voice as
on the tape. We’re analyzing the accent now, Alsatian is our best guess
at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: And he actually claimed responsibility
for the death of His Holiness?</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Not personally, but he said it was the
Illuminati. He said they murdered him.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: That’s ridiculous, the Holy Father died
of a stroke. Did he say how they claim to have done it?</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: The Pope’s own medication. A drug known as
Heparin?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: The Pope took Heparin?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: He had thrombophlebitis. He took an
injection once a day. But no one knew that.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Someone knew.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: His Holiness had health concerns; he was
subject to seizures as well. But he took steps to make sure he was –
watched. For safety. That’s all he wished to be made public, and that’s
all we should discuss.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Heparin is lethal in the wrong dosage. An
overdose would cause massive internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages. At
first it might look like a stroke, but in a few days his body would show
signs, we could easily-</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Ms. Vetra, in case you’re unaware, papal
autopsies are prohibited by Vatican Law. We are not about to defile His
Holiness’s body just because his enemies claim to-</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Of course we’re not. We’ll make a public
announcement refuting this absurd claim.</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: I’m afraid that’s out of the question.
Cardinal Mortati has insisted this entire matter be kept internal.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Cardinal Mortati shouldn’t even be aware
of this, he’s locked in conclave.</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: His final instructions before sealing
the doors were very clear – no outside communications unless absolutely
necessary.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Cardinal Mortati will remember that he
is Dean of the College of Cardinals, not His Holiness himself.</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: As you say. Yet, technically, now that
Conclave has begun, it is his privilege and duty to control public
announcements. I’ve drafted a short release about the incident in the
square, but any other statements are specifically prohibited. For that,
the Cardinal has asked me to remind you – we have a chimney.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: As you say. Commander Rocher, the search
for the device?</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: We’ve turned the power off and on to about
twenty percent of Vatican City. Nothing on the video yet.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Mr. Langdon, you’ve been right so far,
if belatedly, about the Path. It’s now nine fifteen, how quickly can you
find the next church?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The line of the breath in the carving
points due east, directly away from Vatican City, but there are five
lines, so there’s room for error.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Escort him.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: The journals I asked for. I’d like to stay
here and study them. If Leonardo told anyone else about our project,
that could be the killer.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: It would surprise the hell out of me.</p>
<p>****: – a statement just released by the Vatican expressing sympathy
for the family of the mugging victim, a tourist from Dusseldorf –</p>
<p>****: — who is now confirmed dead. Vatican Police have a suspect in
custody, and after photographing the crime scene —</p>
<p>****: — will allow the crowds of faithful back into St. Peter’s
Square, where security will be doubled.</p>
<p><strong>bbc reporter</strong>: Sadly, the Vatican spokesman points
out, where crowds go –</p>
<p><strong>american reporter</strong>: — so often follows crime. We’re
trying now to get the name of the tourist who was- wait a-</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: What are you looking for this time?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Assets.</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: I beg your pardon?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Artwork is valuable, and corporations tend
to keep track of their holdings.</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: The Catholic Church is not a corporation,
Signore, it is a beacon, a source of inspiration for one billion lost
and frightened souls.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Sure sure, I get that.</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: Cfmmander Olivetti said I was not to
leave your side this time.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Wasn’t me, it was her,</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: What sort of signs?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I’m sorry?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: If the Holy Father were given an
overdose of Heparin… what signs would his body bear?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Bleeding of the oral mucosa. His gums.
Postmortem, the blood congeals and turns the inside of the mouth
black.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Even though he died fourteen days
ago?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: It wouldn’t show up until at least a week
after his death.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: He was… very important to me.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Please come.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: You don’t smoke, do you?</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: A little bit.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Sit down before you fall down.</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: “Moved at suggestion of the artist.”</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Moved to another church? At Bernini”s
suggestion?</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Fire.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Fire.</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: Electronic.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: To see my father.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: I was orphaned when I was nine years
old. A bombing in Madrid – Basque separatists protesting the visit of a
Catholic archbishop.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: He died?</p>
<p>****: Fourteen days ago.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: Walls… lead-lined… no signal.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: If the Holy Father was murdered, the
implications are profound. Vatican security is impenetrable, no one from
the outside could have gotten anywhere near him.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Meaning it was someone on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: We can trust no one</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Father… Holy Father… You told me when I
was young that the voice in my heart was that of God. You told me I must
follow it no matter what painful places it leads. I hear it now, asking
me the impossible. Give me strength. Forgive me. What I do, I do in the
name of everything you believe.</p>
<p><strong>swiss guardsman</strong>: Signore, by law we are at your
command. But we are also bound by-</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: I ask your forgiveness for putting you
in this position. Vatican laws are established to protect the church.
But it is in that very spirit that I command you to break them now.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Are you out of your minds?!</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Please. In the car.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Someone tried to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Do you know where the next church is?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Then get in the car!</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: We had no idea that –</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: You heard me ask permission! You assigned
me an escort! Don’t try to tell me you didn’t know I was in there!</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Of course I knew, but we had no idea that
portions of our white zones are</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Or there is the other possibility.</p>
<p>****: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I want to speak to the Camerlengo.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Il Camerlengo is unavailable,</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Unavailable? Why?</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: He’s found evidence that the Holy Father
was indeed murdered. He is seeking guidance.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: From whom?</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: From God.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>olivetti</strong>: Please. Make an effort.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: The journals. Where are they?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Unseal the doors.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Signore, do you realize that for the first
time in Vatican history, a Camerlengo has just crossed the sacred
threshold of conclave after sealing the doors?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: There has been a development.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Please… a moment… if I…</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Since the days of Galileo, the church
has tried to slow the relentless march of science, sometimes with
misguided means, but always with benevolent intention. Still, they call
us backward, ignorant.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: The promises of science have not been
kept. We’re a fractured and frantic species, moving down of destruction
in the name of progress.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Science and religion are not enemies.
But there are things that science is simply too young to understand. We
are here to lead, but how?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Shall we cloak ourselves in silence and
secrecy, as in the past? Or do we open the doors, take down the
blackened curtains, and speak to our flock?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Signores, I ask, no, I pray that you
break this conclave. Open the doors.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Evacuate St. Peter’s Square.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Tell the world the truth.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The cleat, on the wall! Get something to
stand on!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Polizia!</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: Gendarmeria Vaticano!</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: My son… God answers all prayers.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: The College will not break conclave.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: We can’t hide this anymore. The burning
church –</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: A despicable act of terrorism. Father
Simeon will make a suitable announcement lamenting the loss of life. May
I suggest you direct your energies to helping the Swiss Guard confront
the possibility of this explosive device, and leave church leadership
–</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: Eminence. There is a growing fear that
without the four prefiriti, a two- thirds majority for any candidate may
be impossible. Unless –</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Speak plainly.</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: It is the recommendation of many that
you ask to be removed from your post as Great Elector –</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: If it is God’s will, may His will be</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Those journals are private property.</p>
<p>****: They are material evidence in a Vatican investigation.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I am an Italian citizen and I have a right
to-</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: This isn’t Italy. It isn’t even Rome. The
Vatican is its own country, with its own laws, and when those journals
crossed our border they became our property. You will get them back when
I have decided they contain nothing of value to this investigation.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Do you have something to hide, Commandante
Rocher?</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Do you, Doctor Vetra?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Let angels guide you on your lofty
quest…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Professor?</p>
<p><strong>roman cop</strong>: Langdon, is it?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: What direction is that?</p>
<p><strong>roman cop</strong>: Direction? West, I think. Mr. Langdon,
we’ve confirmed with the Vatican that they invited you into this
investigation, but what I-</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Map.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: We’re here… Piazza Barberini…</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p><strong>roman cop</strong>: Professor, I need to know what you saw
here.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Fire and death. Show me where Santa Maria
del Popolo is.</p>
<p>****: The Church, it was the first altar of science.</p>
<p><strong>roman cop</strong>: Professor, I am asked to escort you to
the Vatican immediately. Commander Rocher has asked to see you.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Water.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: Were it up to me, it would not be this
way. It is a sin to kill with pain.</p>
<p>****: But I am a sinner.</p>
<p><strong>roman cop</strong>: Professor! The Vatican insists that-</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Vatican is about to see its fourth
Cardinal murdered tonight.</p>
<p><strong>south african reporter</strong>: – possibility of terrorism,
as the church has now confirmed arson at one of its oldest and holiest
churches</p>
<p><strong>asian reporter</strong>: – resulting in at least six
confirmed deaths –</p>
<p><strong>brazilian reporter</strong>: – initial rumors that one of the
dead was Cardinal Ebner of Frankfurt –</p>
<p><strong>american reporter</strong>: – been refuted by the Vatican,
which has asked international media not to engage in, quote, “wild
speculation”–</p>
<p><strong>french reporter</strong>: – as conclave goes on, with no sign
of agreement on a new pope yet.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: At 11:15, if the church is still in
peril, give the order to evacuate the cardinals. But with dignity, let
them exit into St. Peter’s Square, with their heads held high. I don’t
want the last image of this church to be frightened old men sneaking out
a back door. If Cardinal Mortati protests, escort him bodily. Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>swiss guardsman</strong>: If you think it is the right thing,
Signore.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: I’m certain it’s the wrong thing, and I
will be removed from my post for it. But I also know we have no
choice.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Let angels guide you…</p>
<p><strong>roman cop</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The marker’s no good without an angel,
pointing to the final-</p>

<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: Si?</p>
<p><strong>second cop</strong>: Per favore?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: Non posso.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Cardinale Guidera?</p>
<p><strong>cardinal gu</strong>: Si…si…</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Church of Illumination. It’s where you
were being held, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>cardinal guidera</strong>: Castel… Sant’Angelo…</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: Langdon says Cardinal Guidera will be
killed in Piazza Navona. He’s on his way there with two Carbinieri.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Send everyone we can spare.</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Staying here to continue the search for the
explosive.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: You’re all right?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I’m all right, what about you?!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Cold and wet but alive. Where’s Rocher?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I don’t know. He took the journals, he’s
hiding something.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: This is it. The Church of Illumination is
somewhere in the castle.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Vatican used this place for centuries
as a hideout, a prison for enemies of the church – there are passages
and catacombs everywhere. It makes sense, the Illuminati infiltrated the
Church’s own stronghold. Bernini was chief architect here, he left clues
everywhere, it’s even surrounded by a pentagonal park!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: A traforo. Commanders on horseback used
them to ride directly into a castle from the outside.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: It’s a dead end.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Back to search the outer castle.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: No… no, it has to be here!</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Robert, it’s a dead end.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Bring a flashlight.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Do you still have the gun?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: You told me to give it back.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Ignore me any time you like.</p>
<p>****: Leads to the Vatican. Or from it. An ancient escape route.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: An angel.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Get on the radio and put the word out.
Conclave is to remain sealed.</p>
<p><strong>swiss guardsman</strong>: But the Camerlengo gave the order
for evacuation at eleven fif-</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: I’m countermanding it.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: That door stays SHUT! Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>swiss guardsman</strong>: Yes sir.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: We have thirty minutes left, I can still
change the battery if we can find the cannister.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: There’s a fifth brand.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Two crossed keys.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: The symbol for the Vatican?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The papacy.</p>
<p>****: They’re going to kill him. Before they blow up the Vatican
they’re going to kill and brand the pope himself.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: But there is no pope.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Technically, there is.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: The Camerlengo?! We have to-</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: Please place your gun on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: You could have been long gone by now.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: Some do God’s work for love, others for
money. Which do you take me for?</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: You’re not one of them.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Neither are you. I was expecting a
fanatic.</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: When they call me – and they all call me –
it is so important to them that I know what they ask is the Lord’s will.
Or Allah’s, or Yahweh’s. And I suppose they’re right. Because if He were
not vengeful, I would not exist, would</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Why didn’t you kill us when you had the
chancer</p>
<p><strong>mr. gray</strong>: Because no one asked me to.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: We’ve got to get to the Vatican.</p>
<p><strong>swiss guardsman</strong>: The Camerlengo says he will grant
you an audience.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: I’d like to see him alone.</p>
<p><strong>swiss guardsman</strong>: That’s impossible, sir. No one-</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Have you forgotten who you work for?!</p>
<p><strong>swiss guardsman</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Have you come to make me a martyr?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Men of God.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: We’re under St. Peter’s Square.</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: I demand to speak to the Camerlengo.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Senza chiave! A one-way portal, the only
access is from the other side!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Camerlengo is in danger!</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: You bastard! You sanctimonious-</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: For safety.</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: I need a Medevac to St. Peter’s Square,
right now!</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Order the evacuation. We only have
nineteen minutes.</p>
<p>****: The keys. They’re upside down.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: You think it’s a sign?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Everything has been a sign, why should this
be any different?</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: St. Peter.</p>
<p>****: The first pope, he was crucified upside-down, on Vatican Hill.
Right beneath where we’re standing.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: “Upon this rock I will build my
church.”…</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Or bring it down upon itself.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Upon this rock I will build my
church.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: St. Peter’s tomb is the very core of
Christendom.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: The bomb is in St. Peter’s tomb!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The ultimate infiltration.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: I can still change the battery if we
hurry!</p>
<p><strong>chartrand</strong>: The grid is still cycling – the power to
this section must be down.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Oil lamps. Grab one!</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: What’s down here?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Necropolis. City of the dead.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: It must be here! It must be!</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Set it down flat.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Heat decreases battery life. We may have
less than five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: If I pull the power with less than five
minutes, the residual charge won’t hold suspension. We should leave it
and get clear if we can. At least if it goes off down here the damage
will be-</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Father, please!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: – in St. Peter’s Square where, despite a
bomb threat and order of evacuation, the crowd is actually growing in
size as we await –</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: There it is!</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>swiss guardsman</strong>: Signore Mortati, he is alive! The
Camerlengo is alive!</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Praise God.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Do we have time for that story now?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Do I have someone to tell it to?</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Signores… you are no doubt aware that by
Holy Law the man is ineligible for election to the papacy. He is not a
cardinal, he is a priest, a chamberlain. And there is the matter of his
inadequate age. I’m sorry, the protocols of conclave are not subject to
modification. I will not call a ballot on this matter.</p>
<p><strong>african cardinal</strong>: But Signore, you would not call
the ballot. Surely you remember – you gave up your post as Great
Elector.</p>
<p><strong>second cardinal</strong>: They are singing in St. Peter’s
Square! What happened here tonight transcends our laws!</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Does it? Is it God’s will that we abandon
reason and give ourselves over to frenzy? Discard the rules of the
church?</p>
<p><strong>third cardinal</strong>: Perhaps they need not be
discarded.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: “Acclimation by Adoration.”</p>
<p><strong>third cardinal</strong>: Si, signore!</p>
<p><strong>second cardinal</strong>: Of course! Election by Adoration
occurs when all the cardinals, as if by inspiration of the Holy Spirit,
freely and spontaneously, unanimously and aloud, proclaim one
individual’s name.</p>
<p><strong>third cardinal</strong>: And the law states that Adoration
supersedes all other eligibility requirements. The candidate need only
be an ordained member of the clergy.</p>
<p><strong>but!</strong>: He must be present in the Sistine Chapel at
the moment of election.</p>
<p><strong>swiss guardsman</strong>: Please wait here while we arrange
your transportation. May I get you anything?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Leonardo’s journals. I want them back.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: For safety.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: The Holy Father was subject to seizures… but
he took steps.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: For safety.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: For safety.</p>
<p><strong>vittoria</strong>: Where’s that?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: That…is the papal office.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: The Pope spent a lot of time in
contemplation, alone. If he was worried about seizures, he must have
asked Rocher to install a camera without telling anyone. To keep an eye
on him. For safety. And maybe –</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: The scientist kept journals? So?</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: You figure prominently in them.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Leonardo wasn’t just a physicist, he was a
Catholic priest. Deeply conflicted about the implications of his work
and in need of spiritual guidance. About a month ago, he requested an
audience with the Pope. But you’d know that, because you granted the
audience, and were present during it.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: The fool thought he had duplicated the
moment of creation.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: And the Holy Father urged him to go public.
His Holiness thought the discovery might actually prove the existence of
a divine power – begin to bridge the gap between religion and
science.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Science. The new God. Ignore the weapons
and chaos and madness.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: But you saw the Pope’s position as a
softening of church law. An old man’s weakness. Your father’s
weakness.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: He raised me to protect the church. Even
from within.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: So you brought an old enemy back from the
dead to frighten people.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: Nothing unites hearts like the presence
of evil.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: It didn’t work, Father.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: It isn’t finished.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: I’ve informed Father Simeon of what I
learned and he’ll get word to the Cardinals the moment conclave
opens.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: I was planning on doing this alone.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Put that down.</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: But perhaps it’s better that you’re
here.</p>
<p><strong>rocher</strong>: Put it down!</p>
<p><strong>fr. simeon</strong>: You bastard! You sanctimonious-</p>
<p><strong>camerlengo</strong>: I have been summoned by the College of
Cardinals.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Gently. But within our walls.</p>
<p><strong>bbc reporter</strong>: Church sources now confirm that
Camerlengo Father Sebastian Guttierez has died of internal injuries
sustained in his heroic fall –</p>
<p><strong>brazilian reporter</strong>: – which has spurred calls for
his immediate canonization and sainthood. The Vatican also announced the
death of three of its cardinals in the fire at Santa Maria Delia
Vittoria –</p>
<p><strong>american reporter</strong>: – but all eyes here are on the
papal balcony as we await the appearance of the new Holy Father, who,
despite terrorist attempts at disruption –</p>
<p><strong>swiss guardsman</strong>: A token of thanks from His
Holiness.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: This should help you complete your
scholarly work, Professor.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I – yes, I – of course.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: When you write of us – and you will write
of us – may I ask one thing?</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I’ll try.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Religion is flawed, Mr. Langdon, but only
because man is flawed. Including this one.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I hear you’ve chosen the name Luke. There
have been Marks and Johns, but never a Luke.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: It’s said he was a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: Is that a message? Science and faith all in
one?</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: The world is in need of both. Science can
heal, or science can kill. It depends on the soul of the man using the
science.</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: You’ll lead wisely.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: I’m an old man. I’ll lead briefly,</p>
<p><strong>langdon</strong>: I – don’t believe He sent me, Father.</p>
<p><strong>mortati</strong>: Oh, my son…</p>
