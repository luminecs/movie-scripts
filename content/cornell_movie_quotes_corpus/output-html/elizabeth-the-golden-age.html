<p><strong>ext. title sequence p 1</strong>: Painted images of the
Elizabethan age -</p>
<p><strong>caption</strong>: The most powerful ruler in Christendom,
Philip of Spain, has sworn to return all Europe to the Catholic
faith.</p>
<p><strong>caption</strong>: Only England stands in his way: a weak
impoverished nation ruled by a woman.</p>
<p><strong>caption</strong>: Philip prepares to obey the will</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: 1</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway/salon, escorial palace - day</strong>: 3 3</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: me. The time for our great</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: At last.</p>
<p><strong>ext. balcony, escorial palace - day</strong>: 4 4</p>
<p><strong>ext. thames - day</strong>: 5 5</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: eople passing on the river bank point and wave,
smiling, cheering. They see the Queen now. They call out.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Why do you go among the people, majesty? I
tell you plainly, you will be murdered! Every Catholic in England is a
potential assassin!</p>
<p><strong>int. privy chamber, whitehall palace - day</strong>: 6 6</p>
<p><strong>hatton</strong>: Be warned by the atrocities in France!
God-fearing Christians murdered by Papist cut-throats inflamed by hatred
of the truth!</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: We know the Catholics take their orders from
Spain. The Spanish speak openly of Mary Stuart as</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Mary Stuart is a Queen cast out by her
own ungrateful nation.</p>
<p><strong>hatton</strong>: With respect, majesty - a</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Mary Stuart is my cousin. She is our
guest. And she is under our control.</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: But while she lives, majesty, she is a
beacon that draws our enemies’ eyes and hopes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: While she lives?</p>
<p><strong>hatton</strong>: She is the poison at the heart of England.
The poison must be cut out.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’d have me make a martyr of her. What
is her crime?</p>
<p><strong>ext. thames - day</strong>: 7 7</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Treachery, ma’am. All Catholics are
traitors! Their loyalty is to the Pope of Rome.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: How many Catholics are there in England,
sir?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Immense numbers, majesty!</p>
<p><strong>hatton</strong>: We believe half the nation clings to the old
superstitions.</p>
<p><strong>int. privy chamber, whitehall palace - day</strong>: 8 8</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What would you have me do? `Cut out’ half
the people of England?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: We must act, majesty. Our inaction is taken
to be weakness.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: If any of my people break the</p>
<p><strong>hatton</strong>: Until the day they rise in rebellion!
Majesty, we have proven reason to fear every Catholic in the land -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Fear creates fear, sir. I will not punish
my people for their beliefs. Only for their deeds. England love their
Queen. My constant endeavour is to earn that love.</p>
<p><strong>ext. royal barge, thames - day</strong>: 9 9</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: The people are agitated.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What people?</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Your bishops are preaching that God is
showing his displeasure- the Queen being still unmarried - some are
saying infertile -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What nonsense!</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Dangerous nonsense. Mary Stuart has a
son -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Why does everyone torment me with</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: So long as you have no issue.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Produce an heir and there’ll be no more
talk of Mary Stuart.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Isn’t it customary to obtain a</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Not too soon, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: There are husbands to be had.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: I’ll want the marriage if I want the man.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Austria. France. Sweden.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Why stop there? Turkey has a Sultan.
China has an Emperor. What sort of man do you want?</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: I confine myself to the possible.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: An honest man. With friendly eyes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: That’s where you and I differ,
Walsingham. I find the impossible far more interesting. And good legs.
You’ll want good legs.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: And sweet breath.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: So that you can kiss him without
choking.</p>
<p><strong>lizabeth</strong>: Ship builders are being recruited in
Spanish ports at double wages. The sea wall at Dover is cracking.
There’s no money to rebuild our defences. I don’t need advisers to tell
me my business.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: They care for your safety, majesty. The
threats to your person are real.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And they know very well that if I fall,
they all come tumbling down after me.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Let’s pray, Bess. May we have wisdom not
to fear shadows in the night, and courage when the day of danger truly
dawns.</p>
<p><strong>omitted</strong>: 10 10</p>
<p><strong>ext the tyger, english channel - day</strong>: 11 11</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Let England know we’re back, Mr Calley.</p>
<p><strong>master gunner</strong>: Run out and prime. From the bow
number one gun, on my word -</p>
<p><strong>int. queen’s private quarters - night</strong>: 13 13</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: Bess begins the process of stripping away her
make-up.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Lines round my mouth. Where did they come
from?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Smile lines, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Smile lines? When do I smile?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Now you have smile lines too.</p>
<p><strong>13a 13a</strong>: The royal bed, immense and ornate.
Elizabeth lies here small, awake, and alone.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: `Elizabeth! The angels weep for you,
Elizabeth! Why do you close your ears to the voice of your loving
God?’</p>
<p><strong>13b 13b</strong>: Foresters at work felling great trees,
working rhythmically, in pairs. From all round echoes the same sound, of
axe on timber.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: `Elizabeth! You are leading the souls of
your people to Hell! Turn back! Marry me, and save England!’I spoke to
her just as I speak to you now.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: But she did not listen. She made me a speech
about the virtues of virginity. Me! Virginity! She has brought this on
herself.</p>
<p><strong>p</strong>: hilip surveys the scene through the carriage
window with a shudder.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: Every tree that falls hurts me. I lose a
part of myself. I am cursed with sensitivity. I feel too much.</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: Your majesty has a merciful soul.</p>
<p><strong>philip</strong>: I sacrifice my country’s forests to save the
souls of a lost nation. That is true mercy. England is lost to darkness,
Father. I bring light.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: N THE CARRIAGE - On Reston’s face as he stares at
the fires. He speaks half to himself, out of the depths of his own
fanatical certainty.</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: The light of purifying fire.</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: My time has come, majesty. Send me home.</p>
<p><strong>13c 13c</strong>: Establishing wide shot of chartley
Hall.</p>

<p><strong>int. mary stuart’s quarters, chartley hall - day</strong>: 15
15</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: This is so pretty I’m inclined to send it as a
present to my dear cousin Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It is an intimate garment, of course. But even
Elizabeth must have the occasional intimate moment.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: My Queen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Our friends write to give us hope.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: Soon England’s true believers will rise up
against the bastard usurper Elizabeth, and slit her throat, and throw
her down to hell.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: That’s enough, Annette. Slit her throat?
Please.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: And when the bastard usurper is dead, my
lady will be queen.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Here’s my noble jailer, come to smack my
hand.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Have I sinned again, sir?</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: No, no, my lady. Unless beauty is counted a
sin.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, you jailer. I don’t trust you.</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: Not jailer, my lady, please. Warden.
Protector. Friend. You are the Queen’s guest.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: See how I pass my time in my lonely
prison.</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: Charming, ma’am. Distractingly charming.</p>
<p><strong>int. armourer’s shop, london - day</strong>: 17 17</p>
<p><strong>armourer</strong>: So what’s it for, my young friend? Not for
shooting rabbits, I’m guessing.</p>
<p><strong>savage</strong>: We live in dangerous times.</p>
<p><strong>armourer</strong>: We do indeed.</p>
<p><strong>savage</strong>: The conspiracy gains strength.</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: I ask for your forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>ext. whitehall palace - day</strong>: 18 18</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: bustle of activity, a ripple of anticipation -
`She’s</p>
<p><strong>babington’s pov</strong>: the crowd, the wall of BODYGUARDS,
the cluster of COURTIERS and LADIES, and in their midst, Elizabeth,
almost completely masked as she passes by. Alongside the Queen, among
her maids-of-honour, is Bess Throckmorton; behind her, Walsingham.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: God bless your majesty - God love you! - See
her sweet face!</p>
<p><strong>aleigh</strong>: A puddle in the way, majesty.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: A puddle…</p>
<p><strong>royal servant</strong>: The Queen is at her prayers!</p>
<p><strong>18a 18a</strong>: The Queen at her prayers, her mind
elsewhere; privately amused.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: A puddle…</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: She spoke to me. You have to give me
that.</p>
<p><strong>calley</strong>: Oh, I do. The Queen spoke to you. One word -
but she spoke.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Two words.</p>
<p><strong>calley</strong>: You’re made. A dukedom at the very
least.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Did you see the girl behind her? I’ve been
at sea too long.</p>
<p><strong>int. great hall, whitehall palace - day</strong>: 19 19</p>
<p><strong>alsingham</strong>: Thousands are dying every day of famine
in Ireland. Another rebellion is a distinct possibility.</p>
<p><strong>courtier</strong>: Francis of Valois, majesty.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You have the plans for the new docks?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Here, majesty.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: We still need to keep France out of the
arms of Spain.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Let me think on it. What if enemy ships
should sail up the Thames? Can the docks be closed?</p>
<p><strong>howard</strong>: Not closed, majesty. But the gun positions
here, and here, have full command of the channel.</p>
<p><strong>courtier</strong>: King Erik of Sweden, majesty.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What again?</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Still madly in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Still mad, you mean. . Where’s Bess?</p>
<p><strong>courtier</strong>: Ivan, Tsar of all the Russias, known as
“The Terrible.”</p>
<p><strong>int. antechamber, whitehall palace - day</strong>: 20 20</p>
<p><strong>doorkeeper</strong>: You’ll have to see the Lord Chamberlain,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: And when will he come out?</p>
<p><strong>doorkeeper</strong>: There’s no way of knowing that, sir.</p>
<p><strong>int. great hall, whitehall palace - day</strong>: 21 21</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Late again, Bess.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: I beg your majesty’s forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Given. Once.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: The puddle man is outside, majesty.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: My suitors.</p>
<p><strong>courtier</strong>: The Archduke Charles of Austria,
majesty.</p>
<p><strong>hatton</strong>: The younger brother of Maximilian II, the
Holy Roman Emperor.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: A cousin of Philip II of Spain.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: He’s rather sweet.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: More your age than mine, Bess. How old is
he?</p>
<p><strong>hatton</strong>: Young… I believe, majesty. An</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: And it would put Philip on a leash.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I become almost enthusiastic. Send for
him. Where is he, then?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: How much longer do you think I can play
this game?</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Virginity is an asset that holds its
value well.</p>
<p><strong>lizabeth</strong>: Diplomatically speaking.</p>
<p><strong>don guerau</strong>: Majesty, this man is a notorious
pirate.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Indeed?</p>
<p><strong>don guerau</strong>: Spanish treasure, stolen from Spanish
ships. You will see.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: aleigh kneels before the Queen. Elizabeth
gestures for him to rise.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Well, sir. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Walter Raleigh, your majesty.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: A gentleman of Devon.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: The honour to be in the presence of my
Queen, whose radiant beauty is the boast and glory of the English
people.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, well, here you are.</p>
<p><strong>aleigh</strong>: I’m just returned from the New World,
majesty. I have claimed the fertile coast in your name, and called it
Virginia, in honour of our Virgin Queen.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Virginia? And if I marry? Will you change
the name to Conjugia?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I ask for your gracious permission,
majesty, to return to the New World with your royal warrant, to found a
colony under the laws and protections of England.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: lizabeth’s eye has fallen on the native
Americans.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Americans, majesty. They long to be your
newest subjects.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Have they no ruler of their own?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: None to match England’s Queen.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: These gentlemen are welcome. See that
they’re treated well.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I also come bearing gifts for your majesty,
from the New World.</p>
<p><strong>don guerau</strong>: The fruits of piracy, majesty. The true
property of the realm of Spain.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Let’s see, shall we? What do you bring
me?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Mud, and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Mud and leaves?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Patata, majesty. You eat it. Very
nourishing.</p>
<p><strong>aleigh</strong>: Tobacco. You breathe its smoke. Very
stimulating.</p>
<p><strong>don guerau</strong>: Forgive me, majesty, I find the air has
become stale. I am sensitive to the smell of open sewers.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Continue.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Gold. You spend it. Very satisfying.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Courtesy of a Spanish ship, that found
itself unable to complete its journey.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: The fruits of piracy after all, it
seems.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Philip of Spain is no friend of England,
majesty. The more gold I take from him, the safer you will be.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Well, well. A political pirate. A
logic-chopping pirate.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: And your majesty’s most loyal subject.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: But not my best dressed. W</p>
<p><strong>int. hallway, whitehall palace - day</strong>: 22 22</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: What did you think of her?</p>
<p><strong>calley</strong>: Terrifying.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: But magnificent.</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: `Mud and leaves’! I nearly died!</p>
<p><strong>ess</strong>: `Patata! You eat it!’</p>
<p><strong>margaret</strong>: She liked him. I could tell.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Well, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I’m glad to have the opportunity to thank
you. Without your help, I’d still be in outer darkness.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: I did very little, sir. You’d already caught
the Queen’s eye.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Then I thank you for the very little.</p>
<p><strong>avage</strong>: Salve regina, mater misericordiae, vita
dulcedo et spes nostra salve…</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: His weakness endangers us all. He can’t go
on with us. And we can’t leave him behind.</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: Who will help him?</p>
<p><strong>savage</strong>: Ad te clamamus, exsulaes filii Evae. Ad te
suspiramus gementes et flentes in hac lacrimarum valle -</p>
<p><strong>babington</strong>: Make your peace with God.</p>
<p><strong>savage</strong>: No, Tom! Don’t kill me! I don’t want to
die!</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: Si ambulam in medio umbrae mortis, non
timebo mala -</p>
<p><strong>reston and others</strong>: Quoniam tu mecum es, Domine.
Virga tua et baculus tuus, ipsa me consolata sunt -</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: ANG! Savage falls dead.</p>
<p><strong>int. walsingham’s house - evening</strong>: 24 24</p>
<p><strong>servant</strong>: Visitor waiting, sir.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: You look terrible. Don’t they feed you
in Paris? How are your studies? Learned the secrets of the universe
yet?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: These are dangerous times to be
questioning the ways of God. You must take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: My needs are simple.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: You’ll dine with us? You’ll lodge with
us?</p>
<p><strong>mary walsingham</strong>: William!</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Look at you! All grown up.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: William. This is a pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’ve been away too long, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mary walsingham</strong>: You come with me, William.</p>
<p><strong>rsula</strong>: He’s not still a student, is he?</p>
<p><strong>int. living room, walsingham’s house - night</strong>: 26
26</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Have you spoken to the Queen?</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: I speak to her daily.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: You know what I mean. You’ve done enough. No
man could do more.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: I can’t leave court yet. The Queen needs
me.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: So you’re to die in harness like a pack
horse, are you? And for what? Mary! William!</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: These are difficult times-</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: It’s always difficult times.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: William, come and tell us all the new
ideas in the University. Will the great breach in the church ever be
healed?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I doubt it, brother. Compromise is out of
fashion. On both sides they say there can only be one truth, and one
God.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Sit, sit.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: ere by me, William.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: What do they say in Paris of the Pope’s
call for holy war?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Many welcome it.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: I don’t understand why we must all hate each
other.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Truth will always hate falsehood,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why do we have to talk about war? Tell us your
nice news, William. Are you married yet?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Then we must find you a nice sensible English
wife.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, no. I won’t be staying long. I must go
back to my studies.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Not too soon, I hope. Every man deserves
a rest.</p>
<p><strong>ursula</strong>: Listen to him! When did you last rest, I’d
like to know? He won’t listen to me. Not a thought for his health. You
tell him, he’s your brother. He’ll die at his desk, out of sheer
selfishness.</p>
<p><strong>int. great hall, whitehall palace - day</strong>: 7 27</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: ourtiers exchange smiles at his efforts. The
Spaniards sneer openly. But Elizabeth takes the charade with due
gravity.</p>
<p><strong>lizabeth</strong>: Your highness does me great honour. Shall
we eat our dinner? It should prove almost as restorative as my love.</p>
<p><strong>court lady</strong>: So tell me, Mr Raleigh, in your sea
battles - how do you sink an enemy ship? You shoot holes in its sides, I
suppose.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: No, ma’am. A sunk ship is of no value. The
object is to capture and command.</p>
<p><strong>court lady</strong>: And how do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Surprise. Speed. Irresistible violence.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I think you’re not as accustomed as I am
to eating in public. I have a secret. I pretend there’s a pane of glass
- eine Glasscheibe - between me and them.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: he moves one hand before her face, indicating an
imaginary pane of glass. As she looks, she sees Bess staring at someone
- follows her gaze - and is amused to find that the object of her
attention is also Raleigh.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: They can see me, but they can’t hear me,
or touch me. You should try it.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Bess.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He interests me. Talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Him, my lady?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Him.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: His highness is tired after his
journey.</p>
<p><strong>archduke charles</strong>: No man can be tired in the
presence of so lovely a Queen.</p>
<p><strong>e</strong>: lizabeth speaks so only he can hear, in
German.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: young friend. But don’t you</p>
<p><strong>court lady</strong>: I adore the natives you brought back
with you. I don’t suppose you could get one for me? They’re not
dangerous, are they?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: That depends what you propose to do with
them.</p>
<p><strong>court lady</strong>: I’d dress him up in mulberry- coloured
silk and have him walk behind me, carrying my cloak.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: The pirate is not too bored by the vanities of
the court, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: A simple sailor, dazzled by the bright
lights.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: If you can bring yourself to leave the dazzle
of the bright lights for a moment -</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: rawn away by the brightest light of all.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: That can only mean the Queen.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I don’t presume to raise my eyes so
high.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: It seems you’ve presumed after all.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: It seems you’re determined to think the
worst of me.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Tell me what it is you really want.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: What every man wants. Money. Fame.
Love.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: In that order?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Each leads to the next. The money will buy
and equip ships for a return voyage to the New World. The success of my
infant colony there will make me famous. The fame will bring me
love.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: It seems rather a long way round.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: There are benefits along the way. It is
something, after all, to take a blank on the map and build there a
shining city.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Which you will no doubt name after
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: No doubt. B</p>
<p><strong>ess</strong>: Well, then. I am answered.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: May I ask a question in return?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: How am I to win the Queen’s favour?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Why should I tell you that, sir?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I’ve little enough to offer, I know. But
whatever I have to give - ask, and it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: My advice to you is, say what you mean to say
as plainly as possible. All men flatter the Queen in the hope of
advancement. Pay her the compliment of truth.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I don’t even know your name.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Elizabeth Throckmorton.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: A second Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Everyone calls me Bess.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: he goes back to the Queen, as Elizabeth is rising
to leave. She speaks to the company.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: His highness the Archduke informs me that
my charms overwhelm him. He will retire to his private quarters to
rest.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He’s a sweet boy. I don’t want him hurt
by your schemes.</p>
<p><strong>int. queen’s private quarters - day</strong>: 28 28</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I suspect him of being a professional
charmer. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: He is certainly charming, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: There are duller professions. And what is
it he hopes to gain by his charms?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: He hopes for glory in his New World. He dreams
of building a shining city.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: It’s refreshing to meet a man who looks to a
world beyond the court.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: So it is. We shall let him come
again.</p>

<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do stop snivelling.</p>
<p><strong>annette</strong>: The Warden, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The Warden? My Warden?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What have you done now, you bad man? Sent away
my laundress? How am I to have clean clothes? Or do</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: That was not my motive, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: How am I to send my intimate letters?</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: Through me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And you will read them.</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: With respectful admiration.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Am I to have no privacy?</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You disappoint me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: The Queen orders these measures for your
protection.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The Queen! Am I not a Queen too? What if I
wish to write a love letter? Is Elizabeth to be sent a copy? Is she so
starved of lovers that she must feed on mine?</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: The Queen grieved when your husband died,
ma’am. As she grieved when your second husband</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Tormentor! Is that Elizabeth’s order too? That
you torment and mock me?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: They say she’s a beautiful woman.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She’s called the virgin queen. Why is that,
sir? Can it be that</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: My friend, forgive me. You are my friend, are
you not?</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: I am your servant, ma’am, and your
admirer.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I shall send no more letters. I shall stay
here quietly, in my prison. With you.</p>

<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: You live with fear, in the grip of fear -
fear of storms, fear of sickness on board, fear of the immensity. What
if you never escape? How can you escape? There’s nowhere to go. So you
must drive your fear down, deep into your belly, and study your charts,
and watch your compass, and pray for a fair wind - and hope.</p>
<p><strong>33a 33a</strong>: Now Elizabeth is with Raleigh again,
listening as he goes on speaking to her, now directly.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Pure naked fragile hope, when all your
senses scream at you, Lost! Lost! Imagine it. Day after day, staring
west, the rising sun on your back, the setting sun in your eyes, hoping,
hoping -</p>
<p><strong>hatton</strong>: Majesty, the Archduke and the court are
waiting.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Let them wait! Go on, Mr Raleigh. You
were hoping.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: At first it’s no more than a haze on the
horizon, the ghost of a haze, the pure line corrupted. But clouds do
that, and storms. So you watch, you watch.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Then it’s a smudge, a shadow on the far
water. For a day, for another day, the stain slowly spreads along the
horizon, and takes form - until on the third day you let yourself
believe. You dare to whisper the word - land!</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Land. Life. Resurrection. The true
adventure. Coming out of the vast unknown, out of the immensity, into
safe harbour at last. That - that - is the New World.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: The Queen does not have a private
life.</p>

therefore forgive me, sir, if after much thought and prayer I decline
your offer of marriage.</p>

<p><strong>bess</strong>: Well? Are you satisfied with the Queen’s
favour?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: She listened as if she understood me.</p>
<p><strong>ess</strong>: Then I shall expect some gratitude. R</p>
<p><strong>aleigh</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: I expect I’ll think of something.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Mr. Raleigh.</p>
<p><strong>35a 35a</strong>: Elizabeth and Raleigh walk together around
the perimeter hallway, dwarfed by vast murals.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I like your immensities. Your ocean is an
image of eternity, I think. Such great spaces make us small. Do we
discover the New World, Mr Raleigh, or does the New World discover
us?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: You speak like a true explorer.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I like you, Mr Raleigh.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: And I like you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You know, of course, that when I like a
man, I reward him.</p>
<p><strong>aleigh</strong>: I have heard that.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And what have you to say about it? R</p>
<p><strong>aleigh</strong>: Reward my mission, majesty, not me.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is the mission not the man?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Leave me free to like you in return. That
can be my reward.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I think it must be hard for so great a
Queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Now you become dull.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Mine!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You have - the stronger horse.</p>
<p><strong>y raleigh</strong>: ours carries the lighter load.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: The Queen does not give way to
others.</p>

doesn’t know his place yet</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Have you ever known your place,
Mr. Raleigh?</p>

<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And can sailors not be lovers?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Ah, I see. You like love better</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: When I marry, I marry for my country.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Some…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’ve yet to meet your equal?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I would want someone who knows me as I
am.</p>

want someone to share your joy when you’re happy.</p>

Thank you for coming, dear Bess.</p>

letters. You know what would happen if I was caught.</p>
<p><strong>throckmorton</strong>: I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Do you need more money?</p>
<p><strong>throckmorton</strong>: My father is a tired old man. We don’t

<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: See! You lie! You don’t want me on your
ship at all. You’re a liar!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Would you like to go to sea, Bess?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Majesty?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I’m afraid that’s not possible. Women bring
bad luck on board ship.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh, do they?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Lock up a hundred men in a space smaller
than this room, for months at a time - Men have needs. A beautiful woman
like you would drive us all mad.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Men have needs?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Then let them stay on land and see to
their needs. Mr Raleigh is eager to sail away to his infant colony,
Bess. We must persuade him to stay a little longer, mustn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>42a 42a</strong>: Raleigh is leaving. Walsingham has been
waiting for him. He falls into step beside him.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Mr Raleigh. A word of advice. The Queen
chooses to show you favour. You naturally wish to take advantage of
that. Don’t ask for too much.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: You think all I want is money.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: I hope all you want is money.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: You think I’m a cynical adventurer, with
little breeding and less education. You’re wrong. I’m a cynical
adventurer with little breeding and an excellent education.</p>

<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is it true, Bess? That I’ve never known
the simple pleasure of being liked for myself?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: I hope you believe that I like you for
yourself, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Is anybody ever liked just for
themselves? Are you? I doubt it. Men like you because you’re pretty. And
because you have the ear of the Queen.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: No doubt, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Him too. He likes you because he wants my
favour. You do realise that?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Yes, my lady.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And the other thing too, of course. But
all men want that. Male desire confers no</p>

what I can’t have. You’re my adventurer. Don’t be afraid. It’s all over
so soon.</p>

Throckmorton?</p>

names. But if you won’t help me, perhaps your father will.</p>

<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s a plan for the invasion of my
country. Two armies landing on the coasts of Sussex and -</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Norfolk.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And Norfolk. Mary Stuart is to be set
free, and placed on the English throne.</p>
<p><strong>don guerau</strong>: I know nothing of any invasion
plans.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I refer to this plan as the Enterprise of
England. It should more accurately be called `la Empresa di Inglaterra’,
because it’s a Spanish plan. The plan of your king, my one-time
brother-in- law, Philip II, to attack my country.</p>
<p><strong>on guerau</strong>: Attack? It is my country that is under
attack! Your so-called pirates attack our merchant ships daily! Do you
think we don’t know where their orders come from? The whole world knows
that pirates sail up the Thames all the way to the royal bed!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You will leave my presence, sir! Go back
to Spain! Tell Philip that I don’t fear him, or his priests, or his
armies. Tell him if he wants to shake his little fist at us, we’re ready
to give him such a bite he’ll wish he’d kept his hands in his
pockets.</p>

<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Tell the Queen that I will</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: The Queen asks me to assure you -</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I need no assurances. I’m no courtier and
never have been. I’ve lost my appetite for playing games that it seems
I’m too stupid to understand.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: That is unfair -</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: You call me unfair!</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Let me speak!</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: The Queen shouts at you once, and you sulk
like a child. I thought you more of a man than that. And I thought you a
better friend to the Queen. Her every move is watched by a hundred eyes.
Assassins plot to kill her. Enemies prepare to overwhelm her country.
And you say she’s playing games?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You ask permission to go.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Yes, majesty.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You plan to return to the New World. To
your colony. For two, or three, or four years.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: If your majesty grants me your royal
warrant.</p>

<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: You know why.</p>

and hideous that you can’t even look me in the face?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Why do you talk like a fool when you’re
anything but a fool?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: My friend, forgive me. I’m a vain and
foolish woman. At court it’s all a game. I like to be admired. I require
it. I grow accustomed to it. But it’s all - nothing.</p>

<p><strong>w</strong>: ell, Dr Dee. Here I am again, back to consult the
wisdom of your charts.</p>
<p><strong>int. dee’s house - dusk</strong>: 63 63</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: The alignment of the planets is most unusual
this year. Mars is due to take the ascendant three days after the
anniversary of your birth - your majesty was born on September 7th - and
I see that twelve days before the anniversary of your birth -</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: - there will be a full moon - the moon which
-</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: - governs the fortunes of all princes of the
female gender.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Princes of the female gender.</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: I mean to say, a prince who is also a
woman.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, Dr Dee. I am following you. So what
does it all mean?</p>
<p><strong>ee</strong>: It means the rise of a great empire, majesty.
And it means convulsions, also. The fall of an empire.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Which empire is to rise, and which is to
fall?</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: That I can’t say. Astrology is, as yet, more an
art than a science.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Nothing more, Dr Dee? No more specific
calamities that we can guard against?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He means, Will I be assassinated?</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Queens are mortal.</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: Elizabeth is mortal. The Queen will never
die.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You see, Francis? This is a mystery. He
has no patience with mysteries. W</p>
<p><strong>alsingham</strong>: What I don’t know, I can’t use.</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: And yet mysteries have power. Have you not
learned that?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Francis. Leave us for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And the private life of this prince of
the female gender, Dr Dee? What do the stars foretell there? Or is this
too a mystery?</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: These are matters of state, majesty.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Do the stars not foretell matters of
state?</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: For such a prediction, I must look in a
different chart.</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: Wonderful… Out of such suffering, to have
forged such strength… You will need all your strength in days to come…
And love… So much love…</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: But you doubt yourself, my child… I’ve not seen
fear in</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: Something has weakened you…</p>
<p><strong>dee</strong>: But I’m no prophet. I see no more than the
shadows of ghosts.</p>

consummatum est! It is finished.</p>
<p><strong>67a 67a</strong>: Bess lies restlessly asleep. Suddenly she
gives a start and wakes. She stifles a scream with her hands. On the far
side of the room, sitting watching her in silence, is Walsingham.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Please! I’m innocent! I’ve always been a loyal
servant of the Queen. I’d never betray the Queen, never -</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: But you have, my dear. And you do. We
both know that.</p>

<p><strong>ancing master</strong>: When I push like this, my lady, give
a jump into the air.</p>

trust him.</p>
<p><strong>dancing master</strong>: And round - and round - and round -
and down!</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: a Volta, Mr Raleigh. The jump. I require all my
ladies to learn it. You see how fearless Bess is.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: You like your ladies to jump at your
command?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Sometimes. Do you think that wrong?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: No, no. You’re the Queen. You are to be
obeyed.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: To tell you the truth, Mr Raleigh, there
are times when I’m tired of being always in control.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: You don’t mean a word of it. You eat and
drink control.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Do you say so?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Bess, you must try a dance with Mr
Raleigh. He’s eager to show us his skill.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: No skill at all, majesty. I don’t know the
steps.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh, it’s very simple.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You stand like this, with your hands
firmly clasped here - and when she jumps, on the eighth step, you swing
her round - once, twice, three times - and you’re back to the beginning.
What could be simpler?</p>
<p><strong>dancing master</strong>: Your majesty knows the dance better
than I.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: So come, Mr Raleigh. Take your position.
I am to be obeyed.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: As your majesty wishes.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Hold her tight. I don’t want her dropped.
Play!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Leave her alone, Walsingham. I want both
of them left alone.</p>
<p><strong>ary</strong>: Am I a danger to England even when I pray?</p>
<p><strong>aulet</strong>: As always, ma’am, my concern is for your

she prays for me?</p>

<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Where have you been? We haven’t seen you
for days.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I met up with some old friends.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: From Paris, no doubt.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: And now you’ve come back.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Do you know, I can still remember the
day you were born?</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: I was eleven years old. And you, this
helpless bundle. I looked at you in your crib, with your little wrinkled
face, and I loved you from the first. I vowed then to look after you. I
watched you grow up with your head in the clouds, always a dreamer. I
couldn’t follow you there. And now I’ve failed you, haven’t I? Forgive
me if I haven’t loved you enough.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Did you really think I didn’t know?</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Was it for money? At least tell me you
got a good price.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: illiam shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: What then? What would you murder your
own brother for?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Eternal life.</p>

<p><strong>paulet</strong>: And you, ma’am, are under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Me? What has any of this to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>aulet</strong>: That’s the trouble with intrigue, isn’t it?
With so many secrets, you can never quite tell who’s on who’s side,
until the game ends.</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: My own invention. Theatrical, but effective.
My master has every letter you’ve written.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Your master?</p>
<p><strong>paulet</strong>: Walsingham.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Traitors. I’m surrounded by traitors. Who am I

<p><strong>mary</strong>: Only my little one…</p>
<p><strong>int. prison - day</strong>: 77 77</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Ready to die, I see, Jesuit.</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: I have done what I was sent to do.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Why was the gun not loaded?</p>
<p><strong>alsingham</strong>: What was the Jesuit sent to do?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: To kill the Queen. You know it. You know
everything.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Not quite everything.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’ve told you all I know. Go ahead and kill
me. Take what’s left of me. I don’t care any more. All my life you’ve
had everything and I’ve had nothing. So finish it. There’s a better
world waiting for me. We’ll all be judged in the end, brother. Even
you.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: You’re no martyr. You weren’t even much
of a murderer. Go back to France. Back to your dreams. Never let me hear
of you again.</p>
<p><strong>reston</strong>: Send me home.</p>

is chestnut in colour. Her eyes are hazel. They say she’s beautiful. But
people lie. They say I am beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: She plotted to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, it’s true. I’ve read her letters. I
too was a prisoner</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: So do we all.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I can be merciful. But she</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: She’ll go on lying til you cut</p>

<p><strong>bess</strong>: I used to be quieter, majesty.</p>
<p><strong>int. great hall, fotheringay castle - day</strong>: 80 80</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Who are you to sit in judgement on me? By what
authority do you condemn a Queen? God alone has made me what I am. He is
my only judge. Raise your law above God’s law, and what law remains? In
your vanity and ignorance you set loose the monster of misrule. You know
neither who you are nor what you do. But I know who I am. I die as I
have lived - trusting in the mercy of my God - a Queen.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Must die? Mary Stuart must die? Where is
it written? Who dares to</p>
<p><strong>alsingham</strong>: Majesty, this is no time for mercy -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Don’t preach at me, old man. Look at you!
You can hardly stand. Go home to your wife. Go home to your bed.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: The law must have its way.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: The law is for common men, not for
princes.</p>

<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: No. You don’t need me to instruct you in
your duty.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: My duty? Was it my father’s duty to
murder my mother? I would be</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Since when were you so afraid?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes, I am afraid. I am always afraid.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: You fear your soul will be touched. Royalty
is close to immortality. Kill a Queen - and queens are mortal.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You understand me well.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: We mortals have many weaknesses. We feel
too much. Hurt too much. And all too soon, we die. But we do have the
chance of love.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Do we? Do we really?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I owe England my life. Don’t ask for my

<p><strong>lizabeth</strong>: How have you failed me? What am I to
forgive you for?</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Philip of Spain is a God-fearing man. He
cannot make war without just cause. He sent the Jesuit to kill a Queen.
But not you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Not me!</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: The Jesuit’s mission was to draw Mary
Stuart into the murder plot. He knew I was reading her every letter. He
waited until she wrote the words that sealed her guilt.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: And I ordered her execution. I murdered
God’s anointed Queen. And now God’s most dutiful son makes holy war to
punish me.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Forgive me, majesty. Let me go.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Yes… Go…</p>

<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Thank you for coming at this late
hour.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: We’re at war. Who knows when we’ll meet
again. If we’ll meet again.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: May the Lord God preserve England’s
Queen.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: The same God in whose name Philip wages
his holy war. Philip is a righteous man, and righteous men love to
destroy. They burn whole worlds to make them pure, and leave behind -
ashes.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: He’ll not burn England.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He may. His Armada is invincible, they
say. If London falls, I fall. If England is lost, I am lost.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Never!</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Never? It’s night. My thoughts turn dark.
Don’t you ever think that one day, perhaps one day soon, you too will
die?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: The closer I come to death, the more I want
to live. The hungrier I am for life.</p>
<p><strong>lizabeth</strong>: You’re right. We must live while we
can.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Why be afraid of tomorrow? Today’s all we
have, and all we know.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Today. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Now.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I wish -</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I’ve never known a woman like you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: In some other time, in some other world,
could you have loved me?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: I know only one world. In this world, I
have loved you.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Then there’s… something you could do for
me - something I’ve not known for a very long time - if you felt so
inclined -</p>
<p><strong>lizabeth</strong>: Something not to be spoken of afterwards -
to be forgotten - but just for now -</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: A kiss?</p>

But I ask for nothing. Is that understood? Your life is your own.
Nothing will change.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: What is this, Bess?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: I’m -</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: You’re pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: No one knows. My plans are made. I shall ask
the Queen for permission to leave court. I shall live quietly in the
country with - with my child. The Queen must know nothing.</p>
<p><strong>aleigh</strong>: Where will you go?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: To my mother’s house.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: I’m a ward of the Queen. I can’t court a man
without her permission. I can’t marry without her permission. As for
having a child -</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: When were you planning to leave?</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: As soon as I’m allowed.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Am I not to see you again? What’s to become
of the child? Bess -</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Hush! We’ve no choice. You know it as well as
I do.</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: All I know is nothing’s as it should
be.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: Please listen. You once said to me, `Whatever
I have to give, ask and it’s yours.’ Do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>raleigh</strong>: Of course I remember.</p>
<p><strong>bess</strong>: I ask that you forget me. Go to your ship. Do
your duty. Forget me.</p>

<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: They plan to cross the Channel in

Thames.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: That is so.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Our forces defend the Thames</p>
<p><strong>hatton</strong>: We have three, possibly four thousand,
majesty.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: If the Spanish fleet reaches Calais in
strength, the combined armies will be beyond our power to resist.</p>
<p><strong>lizabeth</strong>: Therefore, the Spanish fleet must not
reach Calais.</p>

through our naval defences. We must be prepared for the worst.</p>

entourage following behind.</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: How did you know about the numbers of
the Dutch barges, majesty? I don’t recall supplying you with that
information.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You may observe, Walsingham, that I don’t
see my way with only one eye. Nor do I hop along on only one leg. Why
then would I rely on only one source of information?</p>

from me! I am your Queen! You ask my permission before you rut - before
you marry - before you breed! My bitches wear my collars! Do you hear
me? How dare you be with child!</p>
<p><strong>walsingham</strong>: Majesty, please! Dignity - mercy -</p>

<p><strong>dee</strong>: The forces that shape the world are greater
than all of us, majesty. How can I promise you that they’ll conspire in
your favour, even though you are the Queen? But this much I know. When
the storm breaks, each man acts in accordance with his own nature. Some
are dumb with terror. Some flee. Some hide. And some spread their wings
