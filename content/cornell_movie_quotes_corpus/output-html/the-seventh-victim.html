<p><strong>i runne to death and death meets me as fast,</strong>: AND
ALL MY PLEASURES ARE LIKE YESTERDAY. -</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Amo, arias, amat, amamus, amatis,
amant.</p>
<p><strong>second girl’s voice</strong>: One times nine is nine. Two
times nine is eighteen. Three times nine is twenty-seven. Four times
nine is thirty-six</p>
<p><strong>third girl’s voice</strong>: Do, no, mi, Pa, sol, la, ti,
do.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowood’s voice</strong>: Come in, please.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. low0od’s voice</strong>: Here we are, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowood</strong>: I have a most painful matter to discuss
with you, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowood</strong>: Your sister - - have you heard from her
lately?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn’t write often.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowood</strong>: Have you any other relatives, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No. Jacqueline brought me up. Somehow I never
felt I needed other relatives.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowood</strong>: That makes it all the more difficult
��</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Difficult? Has anything happened to
Jacqueline?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowood</strong>: We don’t know, Mary. We’ve been unable
to get in touch with your sister.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don’t
you try Mrs. Redi?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowood</strong>: I have written repeatedly to Mrs. Redi.
She vouchsafes no information whatsoever. It is six months since your
tuition has been paid, Mary. Naturally, it is impossible for you to stay
on here as a paying pupil.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>mrs lowood</strong>: Miss Gilcrist and I have talked it over.
You can remain here and work with the younger children as a sort of
assistant teacher. These Valentine cut-outs for instance �- – it’s
something you could do.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But, Mrs. Lowood, I can’t just stay here not
knowing what’s happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York – if I
saw Mrs. Redi myself –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowood</strong>: I doubt if you’ll get anything out of
that woman. But if you’d like to try, I’ll advance you the money to make
the trip to New York. Of course, my dear, if you don’t find your sister,
you can always come back here.</p>
<p><strong>nary</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>miss gilcrist</strong>: Mary, don’t come back. No matter if
you never find your sister -� no matter what happens to you – don’t come
back.</p>
<p><strong>miss gilcrist</strong>: My parents died when I was a pupil. I
left, as you are leaving, but I didn’t have courage – one must have
courage to really live in the world – I came back.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowood’s voice</strong>: Gilcrist!</p>
<p><strong>french student’s voice</strong>: Je cherche Tu cherches Ell
cherahe Nous cherohons Vous cherchez Elba cherohent</p>
<p><strong>mrs. lowood’s voice</strong>: Agnes — ! John Quincy Adams did
not follow John Adams as President.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: Build thee more stately mansions, 0 my
soul, As the swift seasons roll; Leave thy low-vaulted past! Let each
new temple, nobler than the last Shut thee from heaven with a dome more
vast, Till thou at length art free, Leaving thins outgrown shell by
life’s unresting sea;;</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi’s voice</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: It seems all right, Joseph. You see, we
do keep up the quality of La Jeunesse products in spite of Jacqueline’s
absence.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But you must know someone who has seen or
heard of my sister.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Your sister had many friends –but they
were not my friends. I was only the manager of her plant.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mrs. Redi, there’s one thing �-with Jacqueline
gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the
receipts? How do you sign checks–?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Mary, I’m amazed. Didn’t Jacqueline tell
you? She sold the business to me at least eight months ago. It’s my
business now.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Yes �� and I must say I’ve done very well
with it – perhaps even better than Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: There’s nothing you can think of – old
letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find
Jacqueline?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Leave me your address, and if I find
anything, I’ll get in touch with you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m stopping at the Chatsworth.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Thank you, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Why, Mary –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Hello, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: How’s Miss Jacqueline?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know. That’s why I came to see
Mrs. Redi. I’m trying to find her.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You mean Miss Jacqueline’s gone, and you
don’t know where she is?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I don’t get this. Miss Jacqueline was
always so fond of you – she was always talking about you -� had your
picture in her office.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I know. For the first time I’m beginning to be
frightened. I almost feel as if I’d never known my sister.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Nothing’s happened to her. It’s just that I
can’t understand her not getting in touch with you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can’t understand it at all.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well, don’t worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline
only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me
to – an Italian place down in the Village �- “The Dante.”</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: “The Dante?”</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: It’s on Peary Street. Just ask the people
who run it. They’ll remember her. People who see Miss Jacqueline never
forget her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll try there.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m worry to bother you. I want to ask you
about my sister.</p>
<p><strong>romari</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I thought you might know her. She was seen
here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.</p>
<p><strong>romari</strong>: I don’t know no Gibson. This is a
restaurant. Many people come here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She’s very beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I wish I could tell you what she looked like –
I know you’d remember her, She is tall –with dark hair –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Once you’d seen my sister you’d never forget
her.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: Giacomo – la bellisslina madonna �-</p>
<p><strong>romari</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: Let me look at you – you could be her
sister</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes �� yes, if she made that much impression
on you, I’m sure it was Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: She’s not been here for a long
time.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But she was here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car
comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome
man with her, and the chauffeur The lady rents one of our upstairs
rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never
comes back –not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but
always alone and just to eat.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You mean she just came here, rented the room,
locked it, and left?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: Yes – and pays the rent every
month.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Could you let me see that room? If it is hers,
there might be something there to help me find my sister.</p>
<p><strong>romari</strong>: No – the rent in paid. The lady asked us to
promise, I wouldn’t open the door.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s important</p>
<p><strong>romari</strong>: Fo come ti pare. To desiderare sempre di
vedere che cosa c’era in quella stanza.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: He says he always wanted to see the
inside of that room anyway.</p>
<p><strong>policeman’s voice</strong>: I tell you, young lady, when a
thing like this comes up, you’ve got to go to the police. What do you
think people pay taxes for? I ain’t just to keep us chasing after crooks
and regulating traffic. We’re supposed to help everybody. You gotto go
to the police about your sister, Miss.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’ve had some experience with the Bureau of
Missing Persons</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Yeah – well, Mr. Hoag, lost persons are
the concern of the Missing Persons Bureau.</p>
<p><strong>romari</strong>: You’re a poet, Jason. You stick to your
poetry.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: In a way that makes everything my
business.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Were you going to make a suggestion?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes. I was going to tell you to look into
your own heart – do you really want to find your sister?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: Ah, my Jason – always laughing – always
trying to help others. He’s a good boy, Miss – he just talks that
way.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m a good boy, but no one listens to what I
say.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: You do what I tell you, young lady, and
go to the Missing Persons Bureau for your sister.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If you’ll give me the address.</p>
<p><strong>first voice</strong>: She was only sixteen –</p>
<p><strong>first policeman’s voice</strong>: Had she ever run away
before?</p>
<p><strong>second policeman’s voice</strong>: What did he have on when
last seen?</p>
<p><strong>second voice</strong>: He went out without his hat or his
coat. It’s very cold for such an old man -�</p>
<p><strong>third policeman’s voice</strong>: Any identifying marks or
characteristics, scars, amputations, tattoo marks, speech
impediments?</p>
<p><strong>third voice</strong>: No, none.</p>
<p><strong>policeman’s voice</strong>: Any further details?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She sold her business about eight months ago
to Mrs. Esther Redi.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: What relation are you to the missing
person?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sister.</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Sign here.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: I’m Irving August, private investigator. I
think I can help you. Here’s my card.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: The name may not mean anything to you, young
lady, but say the word and I’ll have your sister for you in forty-eight
hours.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You can?</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Look, sister’, Manhattan is only nine miles
long and four and one half miles wide. I ain’t never been off it. I know
it like you know your own back yard. You get me a small retainer –say
fifty bucks, and I’ll get your sister for you. I guarantee</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I haven’t any money but I’ll get a job and
–</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Lady, this kind of work costs money. I got
to cover all the hospitals, the morgue – that’s the first place you got
to go and it ain’t pleasant – the morgue -�</p>
<p><strong>radeau</strong>: You know who I am, August?</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Sure I do.</p>
<p><strong>radeau</strong>: Then you know that if I give you a little
advice, it’ll be good advice.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Yeah �- sure.</p>
<p><strong>radeau</strong>: That girl was looking for Jacqueline Gibson.
I’d forget it if I were you.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Okay, Mr. Radeau, it’s forgot.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Hey, Danny, get me the file on Jacqueline
Gibson, will you?</p>
<p><strong>miss summers</strong>: Whom do you wish to see?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. Gregory Ward, please.</p>
<p><strong>miss summers</strong>: And what is it about, Miss Gibson?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: A personal matter �� I was given Mr. Ward’s
name –</p>
<p><strong>miss summers</strong>: May I ask who gave you his name?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The morgue ��</p>
<p><strong>gregory’s voice</strong>: Do you feel all right?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I feel like an idiot �� fainting in a
stranger’s office.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: We’re not exactly strangers, Mary.
Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No…At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory
Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: The Morgue? No wonder you fainted. I wish
you had come to me first.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Then you know where Jacqueline is?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: But I’d give a great deal to know.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I love your sister, Mary. I love her very
much.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: It’s easy to understand now, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: A man would look anywhere for her, Mary.
There is something exciting and unforgettable about her -� something you
never get hold of �- something that keeps a man following after her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew
her. Today I found out such strange things ��frightening things. I saw a
hangman’s noose that she had hanging -� waiting �� I feel as if I’d
never known her.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: At least I can explain that, Mary. Your
sister had a feeling about life �� that it wasn’t worth living unless
one could end it. I helped her get that room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Weren’t you afraid?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Afraid she might commit suicide? People who
commit suicide don’t talk about it. That room made her happy in some
strange way I couldn’t understand. She lived in a world of her own
fancy. She didn’t always tell the truth. In fact -� I’m afraid she
didn’t know what the truth was. There were many things about Jacqueline
I didn’t understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with
her �� to see her �� to touch her �� in order to be happy. It’s hard to
explain to a youngster.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m not a youngster. I can understand.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: The colors returning to your cheeks. You
look as if you were coming back to life. Are you sure you didn’t faint
because you were hungry?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know…I didn’t have lunch.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: It’s nearly six. Time for dinner, I’d
say.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But I reel guilty. It doesn’t seem right for
me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You can’t make it your life’s work looking
for Jacqueline. ) You’ll have to do other things… live…get some
enjoyment out of life. I hope you’ll let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you.. .goodnight.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Goodnight, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: I’ve been waitin’ for you Miss Gibson. I
want you to know I’ve decided to take your case.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. August, I’m not at all sure -</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Look. Don’t say a word. I’ve taken an
interest in you and I’m willin’ to put up my time to help you. Besides,
I think I know where to find your sister.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Wait a minute. This has got a lot of angles.
You’ve got to take it easy. Do you know a Mrs. Redi?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. She bought my sister’s business.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: That’s what she told you. I looked it up at
the Hall of Records. Your sister deeded her the business as an outright
girt.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: That’s what I tried to find out. I went to
La Jeunesse �� – used a phony health inspector’s badge �� they let me go
through the works – all but one room. That room was locked. I’d like to
see the inside of that room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You think my sister is there?</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: You can’t tell.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Can we go there now?</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Sister, you can’t just go breaking into
places. There’s a night watchman down there and locks on the door.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If my sister’s in that room, it won’t make any
difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: I don’t know if I want to go with you or
not.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: I don’t like this.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Which room is it?</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: It’s the last door at the end of this
hall.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: You scared?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You could go on, Mr. August. You could open
the door. I’d stay right here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s only a little way, Mr. August.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: I’d like to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: We can’t stand here all night.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You could go and open the door.</p>
<p><strong>august</strong>: Listen ��</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. August – the night watchman</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: The night watchman – he is in the salon.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. August, what is it? What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. August –</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: You know where you’re going, lady?</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: You’ve been to the end of the line and
back again – hope you enjoyed the ride.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please — please ��</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I want your help, please.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: These men in there �� don’t let them get
out.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: What’s the matter now?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: One of them has been murdered!</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: What men?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But they were there.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vendor</strong>: Wuxtra! Murder! Murder! Read all about
it!</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: This is about another murder �� a woman at
Fifty Second Street</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But you do believe me?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: The important thing is, the police won’t
believe you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I saw him on the floor. He was cut -� –here.
The blood was running out. He was dead. I’m sure of it. Then on the
subway I saw him �� white �� and the men holding him up between
them.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Yes, of course �� but the police would say
you’d probably had a bad dream.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He was a kind little man in his way �� and I
made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Drink your milk.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t like to be ordered to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t intend to treat you
like a child.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But you have treated me that way.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I won’t do it again. We’re friends. I’ll
never order you about again.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: However, I won’t say that I’ll not take
charge occasionally, and I’m going to take charge new. I’ve a job for
you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: A job?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You told me you were pretty good with
youngsters. Today I bumped into an old friend of mine, Mrs. Wheeler She
runs a settlement house down in the Village and is looking for a
kindergarten teacher.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: It’s not much money, but it’s enough to
live on. You’d have to move out of that hotel and into a furnished
room.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem
nice.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: The people at the restaurant?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: If you want, I’ve time to take you down to
see Mrs. Wheeler right now.</p>
<p><strong>miss summers</strong>: Mr. Ward will see you in just a few
minutes. Won’t you wait, Dr. Judd?</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>miss summers</strong>: Dr. Judd?</p>
<p><strong>miss summers</strong>: Are you Dr. Louis Judd?</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>miss summers</strong>: I read your book. The one in which you
wrote about the cure for drinking.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: You’re not a dipsomaniac at your age?</p>
<p><strong>miss summers</strong>: No. It’s my father – I wanted to talk
to you – you wrote about cures –</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t practice any more. I
find it easier to write about mental illness and leave the cure of it to
others.</p>
<p><strong>miss summers</strong>: Mr. Ward is free now, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: There are any number of other
psychiatrists who can help your father – dipsomania is rather
sordid.</p>
<p><strong>miss summers</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: I’ve come from Jacqueline. She needs
money.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I thought you told me you didn’t know where
she was.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: I didn’t. She came to me a few days ago.
To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She
thought you might lighten that burden.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: If Jacqueline wants money she can come to
me herself.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: I’m afraid she can’t do that, Ward. It
would endanger her.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: What sort of danger?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I’d like to tell you. I would tell you, but
I’m fond of Jacqueline, I don’t want her to run any risks.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: This is nonsense! Unless I know where
Jacqueline is, and how she is, I won’t give you any money.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: You’re a curious man. You’re willing to
jeopardize Jacqueline’s life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You come to me with some wild story about
her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I
want to know where she is.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: It’s not just for myself I’m asking. Her
sister is here. The kid’s half crazy with anxiety.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: As a man, you distrust me �- perhaps you
believe me as a physician.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: Well, then I can tell you that in addition
to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her
sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: But why? She’s been ill –erratic, but I’ve
never heard of anything like that!</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I told you I was speaking as her physician –
not as anything else – You can believe me or not, just as you
choose.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: How much does she want?</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: She could use a hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I’ll give you a check.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: She can only use cash.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I haven’t got that much in cash.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: How much have you got?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: About forty-five dollars.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: For the time being, I imagine that must
do.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Tell me, how is Jacqueline?</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: Oh, as beautiful as ever.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: But tell me –</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: She’s nervous, naturally, under the
circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: What circumstances?</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: You know that I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. judd</strong>: As her physician and I am speaking as her
friend now, too, I warn you that it would be extremely dangerous to
attempt to see her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What brought you down here, Greg?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Oh, I had business with a man… but I missed
him -�</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well, I’m glad you came to see me.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Can I wake up now, Miss Gibson?</p>
<p><strong>nary</strong>: You first have to go to sleep, Nancy. Then you
can wake up. We’ll have to talk quietly.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Happy here?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Everything has turned out so well for me - - I
have a nice job – friends - - except the one thing I came to New York
for - -to find Jacqueline –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s not knowing that makes it so hard. This
way, whenever I walk along the streets I think I see her. I see some
woman, peer into her face and find a stranger. I dream of her at night.
It’s terrible to say – but if she were dead it would be easier. There
would be some certainty about it.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Miss Gibson, I’m tired of resting.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What have you done about Irving August?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Oh, I’m making investigations.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’ve never believed a word I told you about
Mr. August.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Look, Mary, now that I know you better, I
think I can be more frank with you. I don’t believe you. I still can’t
understand the reason for such a wild tale. It’s like some of
Jacqueline’s stories.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Greg, it isn’t a wild tale. It’s true. If
there were only some way –</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: There is a very simple way. Got a telephone
book?</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Is it fifteen minutes yet?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, Nancy. You’ve got to sleep two more
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: May I speak to Mr. Irving August?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I’m very sorry. Thank you..</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You were right. Irving August has been
missing for three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Mama, see. Miss Gibson helped me. It’s a
table.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Beautiful. We show it to papa tonight.</p>
<p><strong>second mother</strong>: Did Michele eat her soup today?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She’s been an angel.</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Mama. Wait for me.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Angelo. Wait.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheeler</strong>: Well, Mary, aren’t you the popular
one. You’ve a visitor again.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. Ward?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheeler</strong>: No, not this time. It’s a gentleman
called Judd – Dr. Judd.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know anyone by that name.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. wheeler</strong>: He asked for you, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Dr. Judd?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Yes, Miss Gibson. I’ve come to take you to
your sister.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Don’t be so amazed. It’s a very ordinary
matter. I’m Jacqueline’s physician… Mr. Ward told me you were in town
and Jacqueline has sent me to bring you to her.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You know where she is?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: If I didn’t know where she was, could I take
you to her? Get your hat and coat. We haven’t much time.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: It’s my cloven hoof. It trips me up
sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Cloven hoof?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Yes. You know the devil and all his minions
are marked that way.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: It’s amid such marble splendors as these that
Jacqueline dwells.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: You can take either stairway – I prefer the
left �- the sinister side.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: She’s not here. She’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I don’t know why she left. She knows she
shouldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: She’s gone. She’s left me to meet them alone.
I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What makes you so nervous, Dr. Judd. Who are
they?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I can’t stay here. I’ll have to leave you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jacqueline!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Is this her?</p>
<p><strong>radeau</strong>: Nope. Where’s Jacqueline Gibson?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>radeau</strong>: She was just here. Where’s she gone?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I tell you I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>radeau</strong>: That’s funny. You went out with her, came
back alone, and don’t know where she went.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why do you want Jacqueline? What right have
you to question me?</p>
<p><strong>radeau</strong>: Young lady, I’ve got all the right in the
world. I’m Paul Radeau, private investigator, and I have been hired to
find your sister by her husband, Gregory Ward.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Husband –</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What ho, wench! Would you keep a benighted
traveller waiting?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: Jason, my pet ��</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Bella Romari If I were not seated, I would
embrace you in three movements like a sonata. Ah, my wonderful one. Fly
with me tonight. We will take your coffee machine and live with the
gypsies.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: Oh, this funny man. He is a very funny
man, but I love him.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What are you thinking of, Bella? Can I eat
dry?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: Oh, the wine. I have forgotten the
wine.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Look, Mary, just because I kept a secret
from you doesn’t make me a monster. Please look at me, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Can’t I make you understand? The secret
wasn’t mine in the first place. It was Jacqueline’s. I don’t know why.
She never wanted anything from me – not even my name ��</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Please �- I can’t explain things like this
to your right ear.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason
Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Who the devil is he?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: A poet. He’s sitting right over there. That’s
his table �� the one at the feet of Dante.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: He seems all right. Look, Mary. It was
something I couldn’t tell you. Remember how you came to my office that
first day, frightened and broken up? I asked you if she had spoken about
me. You said “no.” Then how could I tell you that we were married – and
afterwards – I couldn’t tell you because –</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Why do you bring me wine, beautiful ones when
you yourself are intoxicating.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You’re my favorite audience, Bella.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: Why can’t everyone be happy like we are
– laugh and have good times. Look at that poor little one � so sad
because she can’t find her sister. And that man with her -� he doesn’t
make her laugh �� he just sits and talks.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We are happy, Mrs. Romari, because you have
everything �� and I am happy because I have nothing to lose.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: But you should make her laugh, Jason.
Come, make jokes for her. I’ll bring your food to their table.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You could have told me any time you were
Jacqueline’s husband.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Things changed, Mary. The reasons for
finding Jacqueline changed. I want to find Jacqueline to settle
things.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What things? Why?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: You two are so sad. Your food will not
digest, and your wine will sour. You must laugh to eat well. I have
brought Jason to make you laugh.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Mr. Hoag, this is Mr. Ward.</p>
<p><strong>mrs romari</strong>: Sit down. I’ll get the rest of your
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m under orders to make you laugh. In
Mrs. Romari’s mind my poetry and humor have some strange affinity which
they don’t have in fact. She wants me to play the fool for you, and
suddenly, Miss Gibson, I feel as sad as you do.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Well,then I have spoiled your dinner – “your
food won’t digest, and your wine will sour.”</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You will have to make all the jokes, because
I’m going to be very serious.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m going to find your sister.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I don’t think that’s a good subject for
jokes, Mr. Hoag.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: But I’m not joking.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Don’t be ridiculous. For months I’ve had
the best private detective in New York looking for Miss Gibson.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: But I’m better than a detective. I have an
understanding of people - and a love of them – an understanding of the
city - -</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You don’t even know Jacqueline Gibson.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: But I understand her. That may be more
important.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: It may make very fine poetry, Mr. Hoag, but
it doesn’t make good sense.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mary, when you first came here, I told you to
look into your heart. You didn’t listen to me. You listened to the
policeman instead. You didn’t find your sister, did you?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Look here, just because Mrs. Romari asked
you to amuse us.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: This city is my world. I know every
rat-infested corner of my world and every starlit chamber of its purity
and greatness.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You don’t even know where to start - -</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: One starts by beginning. Beginnings lead to
an end.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: This is the part of New York I love. It is
old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt
Whitman…Edna St. Vincent Millay… Eugene O’Neill…in their time they’ve
all lived here.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: All very nice but, what are you going to do
- listen at every house in New York for Jacqueline’s voice?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m looking for a party – a merry party.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Well, that’s illuminating.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Only music. It leads, but we cannot
follow.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Riddles now.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Wait. This is a party.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Now, if you’ll all take your seats,
Miss Randall will show us the slides she took of Woods Hole Marine
Institute this summer.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Sounds dull, doesn’t it? My ear is perfectly
trained. I can tell the brand of liquor and the quality of the guests
from the noise they make.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: That sounds more like it. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>judd’s voice</strong>: Shuffle the cards well, Natalie. This
is a trick of telepathy not card manipulation</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Now pass me the cards.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Gladys, you hand the deck to Louis
while I answer the door.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Jason! How nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I have brought some friends, Natalie. May we
all come to your party?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mrs,. Cortez, Mary Gibson and Mr. Ward.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: It’s so nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You’ll have to excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Mrs. Freeman, yours was the Jack of Spades.
Gladys, yours was the Seven of Diamonds, and Mrs. Gosden, the Queen of
Hearts -�</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: How do you ever do it, Louis?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Hello, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Where is Jacqueline Gibson?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: What a peculiar question.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I saw you with her last week. I knew you’d be
here tonight. Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: My dear fellow, it’s neither your business to
ask, nor mine to tell.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Wait. Look over there.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: See that girl? That’s Jacqueline’s sister.
It’s because of her I ask.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: But why come to me?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Because there was another girl� years ago – a
nice girl. She lived on Barrow Street. I saw her with you once -� I saw
her with you twice and then I never saw her again. That’s why.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: She was my patient.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: What was she to you?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I don’t think that you would understand if I
told you.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I think I understand without your telling me.
I know something of your history, Jason. I know that you haven’t written
for ten years.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’ve lost my knack.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: After that wonderful first book �- after all
the adulation and the good reviews?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I would have given anything if I could have
written that book. You had all my admiration and respect � once.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Now that you know me, you must feel
free to come often.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Hello, Ward.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: My dear Miss Gibson –</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Gibson? Are you Jacqueline’s sister?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes. Do you –</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Know her! My dear, we were intimate! The
times we used to have together! I bet she never told you about that –
you’re too young.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I’m afraid you don’t understand. Miss
Gibson’s sister is missing ��</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: Missing? Well, no wonder. When she took up
with Louis Judd she went out of circulation, like that!</p>
<p><strong>gladys</strong>: My dear, have I said something?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: No. You’ve just turned the dagger in the
wound - - a beautiful job.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: There are too many people here. I think
Jacqueline may be lonely –? for me.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You see, Mary, I’m not quite a fool.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: At least you knew about Dr. Judd.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And you knew he’d be here.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes. And now that I’ve shown you that I know
that much, and can guess more – will you trust me to look for
Jacqueline?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I want you to look for Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’m a terrible failure, Mary, – a book clerk
by day and a poet by night, and not a very good one - but if you’ll
trust me – at this one thing I won’t fail –I’ll find your sister.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You have such lovely hands, Miss Gottschalk.
So slim and capable –</p>
<p><strong>miss gottschalk</strong>: Oh, Mr. Jason. I really shouldn’t
be doing this, you know. It’s against the rules. When did you say you
wanted them?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I want to see what they read so I’ll know
what kind of books to give my friends as presents. There’s nothing nicer
for a gift than a book.</p>
<p><strong>miss gottschalk</strong>: Who was the first one –
Mrs. Redi?</p>
<p><strong>miss gottschalk</strong>: N - o - p - q - r - r - Redi. Here
it is.</p>
<p><strong>miss gottschalk</strong>: And the other was Judd?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes, Dr. Louis Judd.</p>
<p><strong>miss gottschalk</strong>: It’s here, too.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Would it be asking too much, Miss Gottschalk,
for you to get me these books?</p>
<p><strong>miss gottschalk</strong>: No, not at all, Mr. Jason.</p>
<p><strong>miss gottschalk</strong>: Why, Mr. Jason. Most of these books
are on the closed shelf. You have to get permission.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I wouldn’t want to take them out. I just want
to look at them.</p>
<p><strong>miss gottschalk</strong>: Well, since, you’re over twenty
one��</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mimi!</p>
<p><strong>mary’s voice</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s terribly sweet of you, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I have something even better.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jason’s voice</strong>: A parallelogram with a split triangle
in its very center.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But for what, Jason?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: To unlock mysteries – to unravel the thread
that leads to Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I suppose I’ll have to explain. Go on with
your washing.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I have been at the library.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But you’re always at the library.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I went as a detective. I found out that
Mrs. Redi reads the same books as Dr. Judd.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t think that’s so revealing.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: But who is Judd, a psychiatrist. It’s quite
natural that he should read books on the history of old religious
societies. But why should Mrs. Redi, a woman with a beauty parlor –?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: That’s it. And this figure –she traced it.
The book I saw at the library had been marked “perfect” by the library
inspector in March. Mrs. Redi had it out in April. No one else had read
it since.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m at sea, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Such a simple matter. This figure is the
symbol of the Palladists.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s all clear to me now – so clear.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I thought it would be, but just to be sure,
I’ll tell you that the Palladists are a society of Devil worshippers
–</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Devil worshippers!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Look. I’m serious. It’s a real and vary
earnest society – a dangerous society…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Some time before those nice white gloves are
dry you’re going to go and find out a few things about Mrs. Redi.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Oh, Jason, I scared you. Maybe I could scare
some information out of Mrs. Redi or perhaps Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I can’t see much fun in teaching school.
Why don’t you go into the beauty business.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But I like teaching school.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well, if it’s fun for you, it’s all right.
I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren’t too crabby.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Redi’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: She seems rather an odd woman to me.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: She’s a pretty good sort.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What does she do with herself after business
hours?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely
and unhappy.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I guess most people are.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Well, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: In the old days, it would have been on the
house.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your
hair.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Do you know what this is, Frances?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I ought to know.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>frances’ voice</strong>: It’s Mrs. Redi’s new trademark.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Of course, I should have known. That figure
has been puzzling me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Hello, Mary. It’s nice to see you. No
news of Jacqueline?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: What did she want?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: I did her hair.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: What were you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Nothing! That’s absurd. I heard you
laughing and talking, She was asking questions.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: She was just asking about you - Whether it
was nice to work for you or not.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: And that was all?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No. She asked about the trademark.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: What did she want to know?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: She showed me a drawing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: You fool! That symbol is us – us. She was
asking about us.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: But I’ll stop her questions ��</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I know the others – Redi, Fallon, Leo, Bruns.
But I would never have guessed it of you, Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: One believes -� it’s like any other
religion…</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I’d hardly describe It that way �- The worship
of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: It seems right to us.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I know the theory behind the movement. If one
believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must
believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice
�� that’s it, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Because you are intelligent – that’s
why they sent me to you –</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I think I can give you a more practical reason
for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline’s
psycho-analyst.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: I always thought it was a more intimate
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Perhaps, Natalie, this is a bargain you’re
offering me –I am being allowed to join – to buy safety by betraying
Jacqueline – is that it?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: I haven’t said anything of the
sort.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: But you would like to know where she is?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Yes. There are certain punitive
measures…</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I can imagine. But you did say you came to me
as my friend –that you were concerned for me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: I’m afraid you have mistaken my motive,
Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I have no sympathy for either good or evil. I
have only curiosity – a professional curiosity. What unhappy people most
of you are!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Are we? I thought I was very gay.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: A gay lot -� Redi, for instance. I don’t know
what her sorrow is, but her life’s an empty one. She’s had to have this
to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to
follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you…</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: I was a great dancer…</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: A strange collection. You’re like the false
god you worship… fallen angels, all of you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Life has betrayed us. We’ve found there
is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil’s own sake.
We’re not wicked. We commit no violence, unless…</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Unless what?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: No, you draw no secrets from me, as you
drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You’re clever,
Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are
only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: It would be a charming experience. She might
only protest half as much.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: You’re very flippant and perhaps wise,
but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: What is truth?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Those are the first words I have ever
heard you say without mockery and contempt.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi’s voice</strong>: Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: This is Mrs. Redi, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll be out in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: That won’t be necessary. I haven’t much
to say.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: If I were you, Mary – I’d go back to
school. I’d make no further attempt to find Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: It will make you unhappy to find
Jacqueline. It would put her in danger — great danger –</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: I can almost feel your doubt about what
I’m saying, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can’t give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no
matter what you’re hinting at.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: I have no intention whatsoever of
hinting. Your sister, Mary, is a murderess. She killed Irving August –
stabbed him out of fright when he discovered where she was hiding.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: I had to help get rid of the body. You
saw it on the subway. And I warn you, Mary – go back – you don’t know
what you’re doing, or what dreadful things you might bring about by
looking for your sister. You go back to school - - go back and forget
Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: I’m sorry to be late, Natalie.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: We haven’t even begun tea yet.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Won’t you pour, Mrs. Redi?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Sorry. I’m nervous. This is very trying
for me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us
– but how could you tell �-</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: I should have known. She had no sincerity
�- no real belief.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Cream or lemon, Frances?</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Lemon.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Miss Rowan, do you take cream?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Please, Natalie, would you mind
pouring?</p>
<p><strong>miss rowan</strong>: You shouldn’t be nervous. There is
nothing personal or vengeful in what we are about to do. We have only to
make a decision.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swift</strong>: But it can be such a horrible decision.
I found peace here. I know that a large portion of that peace came
because we are all pledged to non-violence. Now this –</p>
<p><strong>miss rowan</strong>: Our founder must have known when he
wrote these seemingly contradictory rules -� the rule of non-violence
and the law that whoever betrays us must die – he must have known.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: But I can’t understand it.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Some of us, Frances, must believe without
understanding.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: I went back through the history last
night. I read about Johann Rozenquartz – I read what he wrote –</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: I can quote it fully, Mrs. Redi. “We will
avoid violence. For once undertaken, violence becomes its own master and
can lead to either good or evil.”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: But he also wrote –</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: I can quote that too; “Those who shall go
out into the market place and let their tongues speak of us, and give
knowledge of our being and our deeds, whom-so-ever doeth this shall
die.”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. swift</strong>: Since the founding of our order there
have been six betrayals and six deaths. And now there is Jacqueline ��
she is the seventh.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: You can’t do anything to her– you mustn’t
hurt her!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: But she betrayed us, Frances.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: She never betrayed us. She was only going
to a doctor – a psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: But she told him, Frances. She told him
about us.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: I know this is difficult for you. I know
that you love her.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: She didn’t betray us!</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: Even if I believed that, I would still
consider her dangerous. There is the matter of Irving August’s death.
Without consulting me, Mrs. Redi was ill�advised enough to have the body
removed by Leo and Durk. This makes us all a party to the crime. What if
there is a trial? What if Jacqueline is asked how the body was removed?
Do you think, Frances, she would keep silent?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: It is a very real danger and one which
forces our decision.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: What about Judd – he knows about us.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: He will come to us of himself �� the
man is evil.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: And Jacqueline’s sister?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: I have taken care of Mary. I’ve spoken to
her. She’s going back to school.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: Then it is decided. Leo and Durk and I
will make our plans.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mary!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Mary This is so wonderful!</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Your being here – your coming so unexpectedly
-� it’s a wish come true –</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I want you to see my room. I want you to see
all of it.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But it’s a small room, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s grown big with time – I’ve lived here
with the Romari’s for ten years – the room’s become part of me. I want
you to see it �� to know me better.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: My books –</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: My furniture –</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: My window - - through which I see the
world.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s beautiful – that searchlight - the stars
–</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It’s not a searchlight �� it’s a sword blade
cutting the blue cloak of a prince �- not stars –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jason, I’m going back to Highcliffe. I came to
say good-by.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I thought your coming up here to the third
floor to see me �-that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to
be good-by. Why?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I have to go �-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: But you’re happy here – you like your work
�-</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It isn’t that – you said, “have to go.” What
could compel you –</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t make me tell you, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just
good-bye isn’t enough for a friend.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I had begun to write again -�that’s whet I
was doing when you came in.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It’s because of Jacqueline �� I can’t go on
looking for her –</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You went to see Mrs. Redi… She told you
something – what was it?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a
man.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: And you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I have to. It was Irving August – everything
Mrs. Redi said -� it fits in with what I saw -� she even knew I’d seen
his body on the subway.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: If it is true � there’s all the more reason
for you to find Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: And Gregory – he loves her.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: He loves you, Mary, and you’ll have to tell
him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: He’s Jacqueline’s husband. I can’t</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You can’t tell him – you can’t even dream of
loving him – you feel guilty for not having had love enough for
Jacqueline to save her from whatever it was that took her away – I know
that feeling.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: But you’ve got to tell him about Jacqueline
�- if only for the practical reason that he’s a lawyer and will know
what to do. I’m going to phone him.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: She’s got to be found. That’s the first
step. She’s got to be found so that she can give herself up to the
police.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: We’ve tried so long to find her.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Judd could tell us – if he would.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Do you think he knows about this?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: He’s clever and he’s cautious in his way.
If he knew I think he’d advise her to do what I want �- surrender
herself to the police �� stand trial �� I don’t think he knows.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: We could tell him.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Could you find him?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I suppose so. I can pick him up
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jason, I sometimes wonder ��you’re so sweet to
me �- so kind and sympathetic – I don’t know how I can ever thank
you.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Thank me? You don’t need to thank me.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Verse – verse that I wrote. I need it.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Don’t bother going up. I can do this all
night, Jason. Watch.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Following me to find Jacqueline?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Uh�huh.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Well, it won’t work. Love and understanding
won’t make a good detective out of a recalcitrant poet.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Actually I want to ask two favors of you –
one as a poet �� one as a detective.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: It sounds strange, and I’m going to be very
wary.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Some time ago you spoke about my writing
again. I want your help. I’d like you to bring this to your
publisher.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk
as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe�laces; now this sudden
humility.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I should like people to read what I’ve
written.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: And this poetry �� like the poetry you wrote
before extols the passion and beauty of life?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness
of God and the greatness of all His works.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I hope it finds as much favor as your other
book – but somehow I doubt it – the time is out of tune.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Why not let your publisher judge that?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Wait �- there is that other favor.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I’d forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Tell me where Jacqueline is -� we’ve got to
find her.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: You don’t expect me to do that do you?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Yes. When I tell you.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Tell me what?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You’ll have good enough sense to tell us
where she is -� when you know she’s a murderess. She killed a man.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Tell me, why this sudden desire to publish �
to awaken like Byron and find yourself famous.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I think it’s time.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: No other reason �� no woman ��not the little
Miss Gibson?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I’ll do all I can to help. I’ll go to my
publisher tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Wait. I’ll call her.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Jacqueline, this is Judd.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline’s voice</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Judd. I’m here with your sister. Come on
down.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: Mary!</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You’re safe. Nothing is going to hurt
you.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Your husband seems very sure of that.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Yes. I’m very sure there’s only one way to
protect you – to help you you’ve got to come with us– let me do all that
I can as a lawyer to straighten out Irving August’s death.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: You know?</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You must come with us, darling. You must let
us help you.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: For me -� this seems to be the end of a
delightful relationship.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Here, this will put some life into you.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: It’s like coming back to life.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Jacqueline, it would be so much easier if
you would tell me just what happened. I’d know what to do for you.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Please, Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: You know about the Palladists – you know
who they are – what they are. I was one of them.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Jacqueline was always a sensationalist, trying
to seize onto something – anything – in order to find happiness. Through
Mrs. Redi she stumbled onto the Palladist movement �- it appealed to
her.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: I wasn’t happy with them – wanted to
break away �� was miserable. I went to Louis for help. They felt that I
had betrayed them. They wanted me to die – to kill myself. They kept me
locked up at La Jeunesse. I was there such a long time.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: You can Imagine the effect of such
imprisonment on Jacqueline.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: I was terrified. The darkness in the
corners of the room –the little noises. Then one night the door opened –
a man came in �� tip�toeing in. I had a scissors in my hand – I struck
at him, I ran away. He was lying in the hall with the blood around
him.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Don’t. We know what happened. Don’t go on.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Any court in the land would understand.
We’ll wait a few days – let you rest – then we’ll go to the police.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It will all be over in such a little while,
Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I thought I might close up the apartment –
maybe get a place in Connecticut.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’d love that, Jackie. Remember that last
summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Yes. You could become a country wife – fool
around with petunias and pullets.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at
the station.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: All right Jacqueline, I thought you’d like
it. We could just stay on at the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: I never liked the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I like it. I’ve always loved the story – man,
knowing that he couldn’t have the woman he loved and wooing her for his
friend. We’re friends, aren’t we, Gregory?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: It’s been a hard evening for both of you.
Perhaps you’d better take Jacqueline to your room, Mary.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Good night, Jacqueline – good night,
Mary.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I’m afraid this is no time to play Cyrano, my
friend. What was in your mind?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I wanted to get things clear for Jacqueline.
Let her know –</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Let her know what?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: That you love Mary.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: She’ll have to know some time.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Not from me.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I suppose, Jason, that you’ll speak for your
friend – – and your poetry will speak for you.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Perhaps</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Good-bye, darling. I’ll only be gone until
three.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: If you get lonely, go down and see
Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: I won’t get lonely.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: You’ll be all right?</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez’ voice</strong>: Louis Judd! I’m amazed to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>judd’s voice</strong>: I’m sorry, Natalie. I wouldn’t have
disturbed you if it weren’t for a matter of grave concern to me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: I thought nothing concerned you,
Louis.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Is it about Jacqueline?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: No. She’s no longer under my care.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I don’t know how to begin this, Natalie.
Perhaps it’s best to just plunge in. I want to join you.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: We always knew you’d come to us,
Louis.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: But I’m not coming to you out of deep
conviction, I’m coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in
the power and the rightness of things that are called good.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: I never thought you did.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I’ve talked nonsense. I’ve scoffed and hooted
– but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the
balance of power.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: You’re even sentimental about it. What
made you change your mind?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: These. They’re Jason’s poems, and they’ve been
rejected by m publisher.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: This is incredible I It must be some
sort of a joke.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I’m very, very serious.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: But you have never liked Jason. You
always laughed at him - -quarreled with him –</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: And I love and admire him more than any man I
ever knew. I read these poems. He’s lost his talent and his was a really
great gift. What I have to do today – to bring him this rejected
manuscript -�will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and
the most disillusioning.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: This is the most amusing thing I have
ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it �� your failure with
Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: No, she’s with her sister,</p>
<p><strong>mary and children’s voices</strong>: Oranges and lemons Say
the bells of St. Clemens You owe me five farthings Say the bells of
St. Martin When will you pay me Say the bells of St. Bailey That I don’t
know Says the great bell of Bow.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Here comes a candle To light you to bed Here
comes a chopper To chop off your head.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes, this is Mary…</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: But she couldn’t have gone out. No. Are you
sure it wasn’t Jason she went with, or Mr. Ward? Two men? No.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll get home as soon as I can,
Mr. Romari.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Children, I want you to be very good and very
quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She’s going to take over this
class for a while.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: Why</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Because I have something very important to
do.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.</p>
<p><strong>nancy</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>bruns</strong>: The acceptance of a secret is an obligation
and in this case my dear, the obligation carried with it the necessity
of dying if one betrayed that secret. You understand that don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: Yes, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>bruns</strong>: Then, you also understand that you must
die.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of
ending it all, I can’t understand why this should be so difficult for
you. You have only to drink a little.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Yes, Jacqueline. You were always talking
suicide - - of ending your life when you wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: When I wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>bruns</strong>: It doesn’t matter. You want to now. You
should want to. It’s your obligation, your duty.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: You have only to stretch out your hand,
take up the glass and drink a little.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: It won’t hurt.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: No. No. No.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Both Harrison and Conroy read your stuff. They
felt as I did –old fashioned sentiment – weak –</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: You take this all very well, Jason. I thought
you’d be much more bitter, but tell me -� why is it you were suddenly
moved to publish? You wanted to bring fame to lay at her feet. And
now?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I don’t suppose you’ll ever tell her, will
you?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: She is very young – I have an old habit of
failure. It would be a bad habit to bring to a marriage.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: A book of successful verse might have changed
that, eh?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: It might have.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: You have a strange kind of courage, Jason.
Perhaps you have courage enough to hear what I have been keeping from
you all these years.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: That girl you loved -� that other patient of
mine -� she didn’t disappear. She’s in an asylum -�a horrible, raving
thing. I never wanted you to know.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: -��and all the while you’ve been my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: May I have some water? I’m thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>bruns</strong>: Drink.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bruns</strong>: You won’t get any water and you won’t get any
rest. You may as well drink.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: There’s nothing to live for. Jacqueline.
Remember �� you gave me La Jeunesse.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: It may not mean anything to you,
Jacqueline but what about your youth, your beauty? It’s all going, and
you were proud. Prouder than I ever was of my dancing Jacqueline. I
remember when this happened -� This robbed me of my dancing �robbed me
of my skill. I remember how lost I was until I found peace. You have
lost that peace, Jacqueline. You have betrayed evil. There’s nothing
left.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: There’s my husband.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. redi</strong>: Little you care about him.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: If you like, I’ll go with you to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I’d like that.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jason.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I can’t find Gregory. I’ve been trying to find
him.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What’s wrong, Mary?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out
this afternoon with two men he’d never seen before.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: They may have been friends of hers.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: No, She wouldn’t have gone with anyone unless
she were compelled. All these months of hiding have made her frightened
of the streets and people. I wonder –</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: They may have found her. Mrs. Cortez -� this
morning I told her Jacqueline was no longer under my care.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Would they hurt her?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: You’d better go to your room, Mary and wait
for us.</p>
<p><strong>bruns’ voice</strong>: Go ahead, Jacqueline Go ahead!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. cortez</strong>: It is late -�</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: Drink Jacqueline! Drink! You’ve got to
drink. There’s nothing else. Drink! Drink! Drink! I can’t stand this.
You’ve got to.</p>
<p><strong>frances</strong>: No, no. I couldn’t see you die. You were so
good to me -� so good to me. I was never happier than when I worked for
you �� never.</p>
<p><strong>bruns</strong>: You can go. The decision was against
violence. There may be another decision �� today - �tomorrow �� and we
will find you, but now you can go.</p>
<p><strong>bruns</strong>: I told you you could go.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: Please. Please. Let me down. There’s a
man following me.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: I shouldn’t wonder, Babe. I shouldn’t
wonder.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: I’m serious �� help me.</p>
<p><strong>dancer</strong>: I’ll help you to a beer and a sandwich. Come
along, babe, come along.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: Now that you’ve hounded and worried her half
to death, you don’t oven know where she is. At least tell me, has she
been here?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: She was here for a little while.</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: And what happened?</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: Nothing. She left here an hour or so ago.
She may even be home now. Why don’t you try it?</p>
<p><strong>judd</strong>: All right, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: The devil worshipers – the lovers off evil.
It’s a joke-�a pathetic little joke.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: We’ve not asked your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I propose to give it to you anyway. You’re a
poor, wretched group of people who have taken the wrong turning.</p>
<p><strong>mr. bruns</strong>: Wrong? Who knows what is right or
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I can prove you wrong so simply Listen: Our
father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come, thy will
be done On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread
Forgive us our trespasses as we Forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation But deliver us from evil For thine is the
kingdom, the power And the glory forever. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I’m Mimi – I’m dying.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: Yes. It’s been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I
hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time -�closer and closer. I
rest and rest and yet I am dying.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: And you don’t want to die. I’ve always
wanted to die – always.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I’m tired of being afraid -� of waiting.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: Why wait?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I’m not going to wait. I’m going out – laugh,
dance –do all the things I used to do.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: And then?</p>
<p><strong>mimi</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jacqueline</strong>: You will die.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari’s voice</strong>: Death, why hast thou made life
so hard to bear, Taking my lady hence? East thou no whit or shame? The
youngest flowers and the most fair Thou hast pluck’d. away and the world
wanteth it.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say
that, Jacqueline is on her way here -</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Gregory �� you’d better take Jacqueline with
you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: It’s what I should have done yesterday.
I’ll take her away somewhere where she can rest.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Mary.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I
love you -� you know that?</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Perhaps, later, when things are settled,
when Jacqueline’s well again – maybe we can arrange things
differently.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I’ve never loved any one before, Gregory, and
I do love you -� you must know it – but Jacqueline’s my sister �� whom I
had lost and have found again….</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: I know �� I shouldn’t have told you�</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: No, I’m glad….at least I’ve heard you say
it…</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: I hate people who try to peddle comfort.
But,Mary, you shouldn’t mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of
the agony of a disordered mind. It’s better this way.</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I keep telling myself that.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: Well, tell yourself, Mary, that this is a
world that doesn’t pass with the passing of any one of us. All three of
us are going to start afresh.</p>
<p><strong>gregory</strong>: You and I have new hopes �� and new plans
can come from them ��</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Not I �- I am alive, yet every hope I had is
dead, Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I
could speak like Cyrano -� “My courage like a white plume” � and all the
other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might
understand,</p>
<p><strong>mary</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Good. We all understand each other. You,
Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to
do. Both of you -� you’re off to work.</p>
<p><strong>jason</strong>: Off with you. You can’t sit here in this
cellar with the sun shining.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. romari</strong>: Ah! Good! They have all gone! Now you
and I can laugh and joke again.</p>
