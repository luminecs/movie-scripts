<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: We’re out of Capt’n Crunch.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just give him toast.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: We got no butter, we got no jelly.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Listening for the trucks.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Are they really coming?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Where’s dad?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Where’s dad?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know how he found it, T.J.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Found what?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: The money?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I locked it in my glove compartment.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: That was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, I see that now, but the trucks were
coming before the bank opened.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Did you tell him you had it?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Duh? No, I guess he just sniffed it out.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Jesus Christ! The glove compartment!? That’s
the stupidest place you could have put it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He hasn’t bought a scratch card in almost
thirty two months. I thought it would be okay!</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Did he leave anything?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: What are you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: You could look for him?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He could be anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: We should look for him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: The Rez,</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: With more than four thousand dollars, he’s
probably in Atlantic City by now.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: So let’s go, let’s find him before he blows it
all.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I just can’t do it anymore.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: But he’ll lose it all.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: T.J., we can’t make him stop.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: He stole our money. Call the Troopers.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s not stealing if you take it from your
family. Anyway, he made some of it, too.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: So you’re just gonna sit there?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Another Christmas in the tin crapper.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Is it here?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, little sleepy head.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Is it here yet? `Cause I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Wait a sec-</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Get down.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’re all ready for ya’.</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: We’ll need the balloon payment to
unload.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We have it, it’s just that they called Troy
from Titus last night. That’s where Troy works. The ski place? And
anyway-</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: Have you got the $4,372 dollars or
not?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It was some emergency with the lifts. So he
took off without thinking with the money. Completely forgot you were
coming. So as soon as he gets back-</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: When’s he gonna be back?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: As soon as he can get here, I’ll just run it
down to you.</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: This is the second time you’ve dragged
me out here. If you don’t come up with it by Christmas, you’ve lost your
fifteen hundred dollar deposit.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Look, Mr. Versales, I have a good job at ALL
FOR A DOLLAR. They’re probably gonna make me a manager after Christmas
so I can handle the payments if you just leave the house-</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: Call me when you have the balloon
payment.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll call you…</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Wait, where are they going?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Listen to me. We’ll get them back.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: But why are they leaving?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Ricky, I’ll get them back. I promise,
honey.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: That’s our house!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’re gonna get it back.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You better hurry or you’re going to miss the
bus. Let’s get your clothes on, Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: I can get a job you know.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re 15, T.J.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: They won’t ask any questions.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re finishing school.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Come on, you don’t think we can live on what
you make at All for a Dollar do you?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re going to school.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: I bet I could make more than you do.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Where’s daddy?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Aren’t we even gonna look for him?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No! I’m going to work and you’re going to
school.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The only thing that changed is that your dad
started gambling again. Everything else is the same.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Where did he go?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He had to take a business trip.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Aren’t you even gonna look for him?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: And miss a day of work? No. Not again. We just
have to live our lives. Now go get your backpack.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Go on!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: When is daddy coming home?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know, Ricky.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: I can’t believe you’re not even gonna look for
him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Where? Where do I look?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: The reservation.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I told you, he could be in Atlantic City by
now.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: The glove compartment. That’s so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re going to school.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Wait, wait.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Here. Lunch money.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Matt. Could I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I need to come on full-time.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: I see you as a short timer.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: A short timer. Not here for long, not really
committed.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: When I started you said it would be six months
before I could come on full-time. And that was two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>matt</strong>: It’s my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Well, I mean, you know, I do show up. Pat’s
late everyday. She’s late now. She’s always late.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: See ya’ tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>mohawk teenager</strong>: Fill it up?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just three…uh, no…two seventy one, two, three,
four.</p>
<p><strong>mohawk teenager</strong>: Two seventy four.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Make that seven seventy four.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Did you see a Blue Acclaim come in here last
night?</p>
<p><strong>mohawk teenager</strong>: Blue Acclaim…no, but I only worked
until 9 PM. You can ask inside.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>mohawk teenager</strong>: Did you want to support our
Mosquito Lacrosse League. It teaches basic Lacrosse skills to the kids
three to five.</p>
<p><strong>mohawk teenager</strong>: Thanks, anyway. Have a good
day.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Thank you. Oh God, thank you, thank you thank
you…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: Sunrise session is almost over. Next
session starts at 10:30.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I just need to look inside.</p>
<p><strong>ticker taker</strong>: It’s $5 dollars for admission.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t want to play, I just need to look
around for a second.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: I’m gonna need the five.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll stand right here at the door. I won’t even
go inside. I just need to see if my husband’s in there.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: You still gotta pay admission.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’s gambling away the money for our house.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: What does he look like?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Long brown hair. Tall. Skinny. Ponytail.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: He’s not in there.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Can I just look?</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: I told you, lady, he’s not in
there.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s my car.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What are you doing with my car?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That? I found it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You stole it.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: The keys were in it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So you just took it…?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’ll just see what the troopers say about
that.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Go ahead, they got no jurisdiction here. This
is Mohawk territory.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You can cut the bullshit and give me my keys
now.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Troy, are you in there?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: If you’re in there you better come out.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Troy? Versales says as long as we get the money
in by Christmas we won’t lose the deposit. I think we need to talk about
this, so come on out. Troy? Troy?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not kidding, honey, come on out.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: The Tribal police don’t like people shooting
holes in other people’s houses.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: This is New York State so quit the bullshit and
give me my damn keys!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: This camper belongs to my brother in law. He
won’t like this.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Then you should quit stealing cars.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it
got on a bus.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Did you see where the bus was headed?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: New York or Buffalo, I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not leaving this here.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I got a friend who might buy that.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s not for sale.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He’ll pay more than it’s worth.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Maybe two thousand.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He’s always looking for cars with button-
release trunks.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He don’t need papers or anything.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Does he use them to rob banks or something?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: All I know is he pays good for a car like
this.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Where does he live?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Through the woods. Not far.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s in it for you?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He’ll give me something for finding it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: If you try anything, I’m not afraid to use
this.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Turn up there.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Where that stump is.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: There’s no road.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: There’s a path.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s not far.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Not too fast. There’s ruts.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not crossing that!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Don’t worry they already put out the Christmas
trees. There’s no black ice.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s Canada.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No, it’s Mohawk land. The Rez is on both sides
of the river.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What about the border patrol?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: There’s no border.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m still not crossing that.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Don’t worry, it’ll hold a Plymouth. I’ve seen
semis cross it.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: The only other way is the Cornwall bridge and
they won’t let you take that. .</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: They plow it and everything.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: This is so fuckin’ stupid.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Not too fast, there are ruts.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You gotta pick up some speed to get up the
bank.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s just on the other side of those
trees.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Honk the horn.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Just keep your mouth shut.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Just keep it shut. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Thunder! SHUT UP!.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Get back under there!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Hi, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: He don’t like whites, Lila.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: And your late.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: I shouldn’t even be dealing with you.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I know. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Count it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Just count it.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: How much is there?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Twelve hundred.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Wait, who the fuck are they?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Just back up.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not moving until those people get out of my
trunk.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I’ll give you half. Now let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m not taking them over the border. That’s a
crime.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: There’s no border here. This is free trade
between nations.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: This isn’t a nation.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Why’d your husband leave you?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Maybe he wanted a younger women.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That’s what usually happens.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I never have to worry about that. My husband
is dead. Went down in the river on a run. They never found him. Probably
tangled in river weeds.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You better slow down there are ruts out here.
You could get stuck in one.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Keep going.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What if the troopers stop us.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: They won’t stop you. You’re white.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Pull around back then wait for him to come to
the window.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Roll down your window.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Count it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Twelve hundred.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Turn down there.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Stop here.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Now open the door.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Now get out.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You can’t have my car.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You can’t have my car.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Fuckin’ bitch!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Little bitch!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I told you not to use that thing when I’m not
here.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: If I get it working I can sell it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t care. Don’t use that thing when I’m not
here!</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Rentaworld called. They’re coming to get the
TV if you don’t pay by four tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Did you find him?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Where was the car?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: At the bus stop on the Rez.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: I bet he went to Atlantic City.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You don’t know that.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Yeah, but you could figure it out. Just find
out what buses came through last-</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: And then what? Chase him across the country.
Miss work. No.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: What happened to your face?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: What, did you get in a fight with
somebody?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It was no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: You got in a fight, for real?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Some Indian chick tried to steal your Dad’s
car.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: No way. I say we go back there and kick some
Mohawk ass.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Where’s your car?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll get it tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: You left it on the rez? That’s so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I didn’t have a tow rope.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: I still say we go back there and kick some
Mohawk ass.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Forget it T.J. Did you and Ricky eat?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: That would be kinda miraculous since there’s
no food in the house.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: There’s food.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Popcorn and Tang.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hi, Lila</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Mike.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How’s life at the Bingo Palace.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Good. How’s business?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Oh, you know, okay.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: How much for that one?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Come on, Lila.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: What?! I’ve been saving up.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You know what.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Does Bernie Littlewolf run your whole
life?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, but he said not to sell you a car.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I gotta walk down 37 with the semis kickin’ up
snow and mud in my hair just to get to the work.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: For you, all I got are two Chevettes,a Horizon
and a Civic.</p>

-Mrs. Bonaparte, I have good news.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: -I’m the business manager of Mr. E.F.
ThreeRivers and I have been authorized to inform you that you have
inherited money. -Are you still there? -Wait, I don’t WANT any money, I
want to GIVE you money. -That’s right. You have inherited money from his
computer fortune. -He was the second richest man next to Bill Gates. -He
left you Twenty-six thousand seven hundred and fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>fifty dollars!</strong>: -Oh no, you have no obligation
whatsoever, Mrs. ThreeRivers, just a small processing fee of 29.00
dollars will authorize me to send out your first payment of
thirteen-thousand three hundred and seventy five dollars. -You can put
it on any major credit card. Of course, you can always refuse the money.
-Sure, I can hold.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Are they always there?</p>

spending three months in jail.</p>

nights of smuggling. But back then it was cigarettes and everybody did
it. Some of the troopers were into it, too.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Smuggling?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yeah. But when they lowered the tax on
cigarettes in Canada most people got out of it and the rest switched
over to Chinese.</p>

<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: -Hi, is Mitch there?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: -Hi Mitch. It’s T.J. No, T.J. from school.
Yeah, man. Right. Uh, I was wondering if you still needed those numbers

bag.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It didn’t feel like there was anything in that
bag.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We gotta go back.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I can’t believe they put their baby in a duffle
bag.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I can’t believe you left it out there.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: If you’d let me search it I would never have
taken it-</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We gotta go back.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I know! I know that.</p>
<p><strong>mitch</strong>: That’s what you wanted, right?</p>

<p><strong>ray</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Tap the bottom of his feet.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s what they did to get Ricky breathing
when he was born.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t want to touch it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Well, I can’t hold it and drive.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t think it matters.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: At least put him next to your body. That will
warm him up.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: But it’s too late.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just do it! We can’t give it back to her
cold.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh shit. What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Calm down. Just pull over.</p>

him one, so keep your mouth shut.</p>

<p><strong>lila</strong>: He was dead.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay, whatever, you brought him back to
life.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That was the Great Spirit, not me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: All I know is Kmart is closed and I got nothing
for under the tree.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Look, I don’t have time for that. I can’t get
deep about every little thing. I just have to keep on going. I only need
one more run to have enough for my double.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Merry Christmas or whatever.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s that?</p>

<p><strong>ray</strong>: Well, I don’t want you hanging around him. That
kid is bad news.</p>

<p><strong>ray</strong>: Look , Mister, I got more important things to
worry about than toys. I’m trying to get our doublewide.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Oh, yeah. I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, you can lose the attitude. Anyway, Kmart
was closed by the time I got off work.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I told you to be careful with the microwave,
didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Bernie!</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: Is there a Ray Eddy here?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: Can I speak to you outside for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I haven’t gotten the light fixed-</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: It’s not about that. I just have a
few questions.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: This is about the woman who was with
you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: How long have you known her?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Not too long. She looks after my kids.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: She’s a smuggler.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Wow. That’s a shock.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: Yes, well, there is that element on
the Reservation I’m sure you know.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, I’ve heard about it but I didn’t know she
was involved.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: How did you happen to meet her?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Uh, I think there was a sign for a baby sitter
at the Wolf Mart. That’s where I get my gas.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: I just thought you should be aware
of that. She’s known to have smuggled illegal immigrants into the
country.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: If I were you I’d find a new baby
sitter. You don’t want her around young kids.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: Well, you have an enjoyable
Holiday.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Thanks. You, too.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Why is the police man here?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: T.J. could you come out here for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: What did he want? Did something happen to
Dad?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Then what did he want?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Did you have a fire last night?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: The pipes froze so I fixed `um.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You fixed um?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Did you happen to use the blow torch?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Look at this. We can’t live here anymore!</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: It’s just a tin crapper.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, it was our house.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: So, we’re gettin’ a new one, right?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Jesus, you could have killed yourself and your
brother.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: It’s not yours, he gave it to me.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Are you gonna shoot me now, too?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Put that thing down!</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Maybe he didn’t like gettin’ shot in his own
house. Maybe that’s why he left.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Some accident you shot him in the foot.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He spent the food money on scratch cards,</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: So, he’d done it before.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Gimme that thing.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: T.J. come on now.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: You can’t have it. It’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He was clean for 23 months.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I didn’t know how else to keep us together. I
mean…he’s a good dad when he’s not gamblin’.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Yeah, awesome dad. Robs us and takes off a
week before Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: The game’s over. They’re verifying the
last winner.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: That’s okay. I still wanna buy a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: I can’t sell you one.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I got money.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I just want to buy some scratch cards.</p>
<p><strong>ticket taker</strong>: Go to Wolf Mart, they sell `um
there.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I quit smuggling.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: T.J. set the trailer on fire.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He didn’t mean to, but the pipes froze and he
got that damn torch out – which I told him not to do touch when I wasn’t
there – and he tried to thaw them out-</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I got glasses and now I can see up close.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: There’s a hole in my bedroom floor. We gotta
move.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I just need one more run to get the double.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Look you can have the Acclaim. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What is it then?!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Are you still mad about that baby? `Cause it
wasn’t all my fault, ya’ know. I mean who puts their kid in a duffle
bag?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You’re gonna need a lot of money to take care
of a one year old baby.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I got enough.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah, but you gotta get him first.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll help you. You can even borrow my gun.</p>
<p><strong>angle from bingo palace entrance</strong>: The Ticket Taker
watches the Acclaim drive away.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You should see the inside.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: How many bedrooms?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Three. And it’s got a jacuzzi tub in the master
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Wall to wall carpet?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh yeah. But the best thing is the insulation.
The pipes can never freeze.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: …what I think you’ll find with the
Commodore – and you’ll be the judge – is that the vinyl wall covering is
perfect for small children. There is never a need to repaint or even
touch up-</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I wanna schedule a delivery.</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: Give me just a second.</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: Is this all of it?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s three thousand but I want it delivered
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: I told you all or nothing.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Take it as a deposit. All you have to do is
show up. If I don’t have the rest you keep it.</p>
<p><strong>versailles</strong>: Can’t argue with that. You’ll have to
sign something, though.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Blow the horn.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Heat wave!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You got a run for us, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: It’s pretty slow after Christmas. Unless you
wanna to go off the Rez, there’s a guy up in Montreal who’s usually got
heads.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: How far?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Twenty miles or so. But…you gotta watch out
for the Mounties and the Surete. and…this guy deals in ya’ know
girls.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Have you ever been there?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: A few times. Have you?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No, Troy didn’t like to travel. He liked to
work in his shed, mostly.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Up there. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Can’t miss that.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Oui?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Bruno.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You looking for a job.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: No, Jimmy called-</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Oh yeah, Jimmy. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Put your hands up.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Okay we go.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: D’is way.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: D’at your car?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Open the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We need to get paid, first.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You only got six hundred here.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You get the rest at drop off.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s six hundred apiece.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: That’s the deal I make with Jimmy, now you
want to change?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s twelve hundred.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You want to make a problem?</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: …because you’re not making a problem for me.
And you’re making a problem for them. Let me show you something.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Let’s just go.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay. We’ll take them.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just open the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You must be the brains of the operation.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I want the rest.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: I don’t have any more.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Go get it.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: Give it to her.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Let’s get out of here. I’ll give you the rest
of the money.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No. But thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You’re gonna get us all killed.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Put it there.</p>
<p><strong>bruno</strong>: You aren’t so smart as you look.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He shot me.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: You should’a just taken the money from me?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m tired of people stealing from me. Is it all
there?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We gotta get outta here, first.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Just COUNT IT and make sure it’s all there!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Is it there?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It’s all there.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Slow down a little. We gotta keep it under the
speed limit.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We gotta get off this road.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Slow down!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We gotta get off this road!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How much farther to the reservation?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Just up at the tree line.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What the hell? We’re on the reservation.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: They can’t arrest us but if they catch us
they’ll take the money.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Shit!</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: That ice is black out here.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Will it hold us?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dispatcher</strong>: …the Quebec Surete in pursuit of a
vehicle with New York State plates, identified as a blue Plymouth
Acclaim and the suspects are two women, suspected to be carrying
illegals…</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: We gotta crawl out the window.</p>
<p><strong>angle</strong>: Trooper Napoli gets in his cruiser and heads
down the bank toward the women, lights flashing.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hi Mom.</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: Jimmy, I told you not to bring no more half
frozen people in here off the river.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: We just need to borrow your oven, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: I don’t see how I can get any baking done.
I’m supposed to be baking 200 doughnuts for pee wee Lacrosse and now I
have people bleeding and dripping all over my kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: Sit down, I can’t reach up that high.</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: Looks like somebody tried to blow your brains
out.</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: Get outta here, Jimmy. They gotta strip down.
Gimme those jackets.</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: Somebody’s been beatin’ up on you.</p>
<p><strong>velma</strong>: You, too.</p>
<p><strong>three rivers</strong>: -Good, good Mike. What can I do for
you? - -You say non-native smugglers? -A white woman? On the Rez? -I’ll
look into it and give you a call back. Sure thing. -I’ll take your
request to the Tribal Council and give you a call back. -No problem,
Mike. You bet.</p>
<p><strong>three rivers</strong>: Hi, Rosalie.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Billy.</p>
<p><strong>three rivers</strong>: We have a situation with a couple
smugglers. They got chased by the Quebec police and crossed the river
but their car went in and now the troopers know they’re on the Rez.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>three rivers</strong>: Lila Littlewolf and some white
woman.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: What do the troopers want?</p>
<p><strong>three rivers</strong>: A surrender of the two illegals and
the Non-Native smuggler. They need an example here.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Do you know where they are?</p>
<p><strong>three rivers</strong>: Probably over at Velma’s.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Turn them in.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: What about Lila Littlewolf?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: We got our own court system.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: We don’t charge people with smuggling.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: Maybe we should.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: If we did, we’d have to arrest half the
people on the Rez.</p>
<p><strong>barbara</strong>: We can expel her.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You can’t start throwin’ Mohawks off the
Rez, Rosalie. There’s only, what, six thousand of us as it is.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: She makes the Mohawk people look bad.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: But she has a Mohawk son.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: She cost us a Mohawk son.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Jake was a big boy. He knew what he was
doin’</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: She’ll never be anything but a
smuggler.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: We’ve had smuggling on the Rez since Al
Capone.</p>
<p><strong>rosalie</strong>: Then we’ll take a vote.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Hi, Billy.</p>
<p><strong>three rivers</strong>: Velma, seen any smugglers tonight?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy</strong>: Come on, Billy, you never bothered with
smugglers before.</p>
<p><strong>three rivers</strong>: Rosalie is worried people are gonna
think the Mohawks let in terrorists. Plus, I got the Troopers on my
back. They want the illegals and they say there’s some white lady with
them too. Is that true, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>three rivers</strong>: You got white women doing it now?
Jesus. Well, if you see any, let me know.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: No. You stay here.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hi, Lila.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Hi Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: You’re in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: The council voted to expel you.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Expel me?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: For five years. You can appeal, but you’ll
never be able to change Rosalie’s mind.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: They can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: They’ll make your life miserable if you try
to stay.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: They’ve already done that.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Believe me, it could get even worse.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I thought this was all legal on the
reservation.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Look, I gotta get home.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: If she leaves, they’ll turn you in Lila. The
troopers want somebody.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: But, she’s a Mohawk.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: The Chiefs want her out, so there’s nothing
standing between her and the troopers.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Listen, my kids got no one but me.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: If you leave she won’t see her son
again.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Lila, you’re giving up on him and he’s only
one year old.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Just go.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: At least you got family to take care of him,
ya’ know?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: He might be better off.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Jake wouldn’t agree with that.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: It was all for a new crib. I wanted the baby
to have a pretty new crib, not some handmedown. And he wouldn’t let me
go alone. I was too fat to get behind the steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: He wanted to keep you and little Jake
safe.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s just a few months, right?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I got baby stuff in the shed.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Get a good used single wide with insulation.
Insulation is the key thing. Versailles will give you a hard time, but
that will leave enough for you and the boys to live on for a couple of
months. Ricky’s allergic to penicillin. And you can’t feed `em Pringles
all the time. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: But you gotta get there quick, before the
police, `cause T.J. will get scared. I don’t want him to get scared, you
know.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: And don’t let him jerk you around. Versailles,
I mean. Go with her. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ricky</strong>: Can I have more corn?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Sorry, Thunder, I got nothing for you.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: I need his coat.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Where’s his coat?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You can’t have him.</p>
<p><strong>lila</strong>: Say goodbye to your Dudah.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: She’s gonna kill me for taking this out of
her car.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How long is it for me. You know if I
confess?</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: As long as they’re not on a watch
list. Four months.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: I don’t think you have much to worry
about judging from the look of them, probably brought here to work in
the sex trade.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Will they get sent back?</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: Not necessarily. They can apply for
asylum.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Can I have a cigarette?</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: Is there somebody I can call for
you? To take care of your children.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I got somebody.</p>
<p><strong>trooper napoli</strong>: A relative.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: A friend.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: But I need to call my kid.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: Hello. Hi, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: -Mom are you there? What’s wrong? -What kinda
trouble? -What did you do? -A smuggler!? Holy shit! -Are you in jail?
-But are you’re going to jail!?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: -Yeah, okay. What does that mean? But why? I
can take care of him, I do it all the time. But I don’t see why we
need-?</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: -Who? A baby? No way. -Yeah I know where the
stuff is. It’s in the shed, but that’s so stupid!.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: -Yeah, I’m here. Somebody’s at the door.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: -Okay. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>t.j.</strong>: You’re gonna have to get the little pieces up
high – or he’ll eat them.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hi, You’ve reached Ray. Leave me a message and
I’ll get back to you just as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: Ray, are you gonna pick up or not?</p>
<p><strong>troy</strong>: I need you to send me some money so I can get
home. I’m stuck here. I could already be back at work by now. Please
Ray, I’m at the YMCA in Tampa. I love you. I miss you. Please call me
here. Seriously. And tell the boys-</p>
