<p><strong>choir</strong>: In the silence of our souls, O Lord, we
contemplate Thy peace</p>
<p><strong>choir</strong>: Free from all the world’s desires Free of
fear and all anxiety Ooooh. Ooooh Ooooh. Ooooh Alleluia Alleluia Sing
Alleluia!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Do you know we’ve made love one hundred and
thirteen times?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: No, one.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: So I don’t know everything about you. I don’t
know your favorite movie stars. I can’t remember the name of your
favorite perfume. I have racked my brain and I can’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s funny. It’s “My Sin.”</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: But I do know, in the last twenty four years,
that I have never been out of love with you.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well, did we like it?</p>
<p><strong>friend’s wife</strong>: I loved it.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Bev Walsh was wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>friend’s wife</strong>: I liked them all.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: It was funny.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: It was a comedy. Wasn’t it? Essentially?</p>
<p><strong>friend’s wife</strong>: Well let’s face it: Clyde Banner’s
getting fat.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>friend’s wife</strong>: He should never turn profile.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Most of us shouldn’t turn profile.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What was it you were you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Mmm, mm. Yeah. How was the show?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Mmmh. Trouble sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Burning the midnight oil?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well, the month’s up. I think we should
stick to the plan.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: The plan was if I needed to call him.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yeah. Okay. Don’t worry about it. Get some
sleep. By the way, I am working on those Michigan State tickets.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>****: What about the Warrens, did you call them?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, they said they’ll make it some evening soon.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: “Joey Georgella. New football coach for
Trinity.”</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Did you check with Jane for the Michigan
State tickets?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes. She’ll talk to John. Where’s Conrad?
This’ll get cold.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Con!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Will you drop those suits at the cleaners
for me?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: They won’t be back by Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: That’s okay. Connie!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’ll be right there!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Here he is!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Did you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hungry?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh…uh… hungry, uh?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s French toast. It’s your favorite.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh… I’m not really hungry.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Breakfast, pal, remember? Main meal.
Energy!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You’re not hungry, you’re not hungry!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Wait a minute, Beth, Hang on. He’s gonna eat
it. Come on. It’s French toast.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: There’s fresh fruit for you when you get home
from school later.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What are you doing? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You can’t save French toast.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You have to charm Mr. Herman. Did you charm
him? You have to eat, Con. We just want you keep on getting
stronger.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Dad, I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah. I got to go. Lazenby’s picking me
up.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh. Is he? Great!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Why is it great?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well. I don’t see the old gang much anymore.
I miss them. Bring them around… Phil, Don, and Dick Van Buren. We’ll
play some touch football on the lawn.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Con!</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: It’s called flake.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: Come on, Jarrett! We’re late,
let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: Jarrett. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Uh, we’re late `cause little Dickie’s mom
had to pack his lunch.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: Christ, Stillman! You guys were
late at my house. I been up all night studying for this poly-sci
exam.</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: That guy wants a goddamn personal analysis
of it all. How do you make sense of that crap, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: You read the crap!</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: Oh, shit! When was the last time
you read something?</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Yeah. Right! We swim our ass everyday,
when are we supposed to study, uh?.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: I swim and I study.</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Get a sense of reality, Lazenby. What you
reading?</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: Meditation!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hardy.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: You guys tried meditation?</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Meditation?</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: It’s just like thinking, Stillman. No, I
don’t do it too often.</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Ain’t that junior English? You got all
junior classes this year? They didn’t pass you on anything?</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: Stillman, you know they don’t pass you on…
breathing in that dump if you don’t take the final.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: Hey, man, get something on that
radio, really. You know, I gotta study.</p>
<p>****: I hope it’s a long train. I’ve got to get the stuff down. I’m
gonna flunk this test.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: We’re going to be late.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: Yes, it looks like shit. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Hey, hey, hey! Hey, there’s Pratt.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: Look at that ass!</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Let me out, I need a jump.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: No dirty stuff out of the window.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: No dirty stuff? Pratt! You have
nice …knees!</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Hey. Interested in something. Jarrett?</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: How about we discuss some theory, here?
Conrad, what’s your theory on Jude Fawley? Conrad?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: Do you think he was powerless in the grip
of circumstances… or could he have helped himself?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t… Uh…Powerless? I guess he thought he
was, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>joel</strong>: The guy was a real jerk. He was hung up on
what was the moral thing to do. It didn’t make any sense.</p>
<p><strong>teacher</strong>: I think that’s a little too easy, Joel.
Paul? What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I found the book hard to follow. I couldn’t
figure it out.</p>
<p>****: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh, Dr. Berger?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hi. This is Conrad Jarrett calling.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Conrad Jarrett! Dr. Crawford at Hillsboro
Hospital gave me your number… and…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Oh, yes! I’m with a patient now. Can you
call back at two fifteen?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t think I’ll be free.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Then give me your number. I’ll call you
tonite. Hello? Hello?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh, that’s OK, I’ll try to call you back.
Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: Go! OK, Come on, now! Move it, you
guys! Move it! Keep it going! Keep it going! Keep it going! Come on!
Keep plugging! Plugging! Use those legs! Use those legs! Lazenby, get
with it! Jarrett, keep your head down! Work it out there! Work it! Come

on. Jarrett! Push on!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Was he actually a client of yours?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well. Regionally.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I mean.. it’s tragic. Really. Look at him
now. He’s lost everything.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Fish too dry?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: It’s not too dry.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: They have a new mechanic at C&amp;S.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What happened to little Harry?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t know. I think he took a job in Skokie.
Anyway, this new mechanic is so …awkward. Is that shirt ripped? Leave it
on the table in the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: That girl from the hospital, the one you
painted with, she was from Skokie, wasn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh, uh.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What was her name?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Karen.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Sharon?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Karen!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Karen.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Conrad, do you want me to sign you up for
round robin at the club?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I haven’t played in a year.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well, don’t you think it’s time to start?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Good god, not the Murrays…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Lift the rope off Bucky!</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: We’re going in!</p>
<p>****: Give me your hand!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Bucky!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Fuck! Fuck! Ha…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh, hi. How are you? /…/ Oh. I’m fine /…/
Couldn’t be better, really. Oh, terrific, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Ha! Hi! Come in. It’s OK, they all do
that.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Hmm…. Jarrett. How long since you’ve been
out of the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: A month and a half.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Feeling depressed?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: On stage?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: People nervous… treating you like you’re
…a dangerous character?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah. I guess a little.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: How long were you in the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Four months.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I tried to off myself. Isn’t it down
there?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: It doesn’t say what your method was.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Double-edged Super Blue.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Friends?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Everything…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: You’re back in school? Everything okay at
school? Teachers?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: No problems?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: So why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh… I’d like to be more in control, I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: So people can quit worrying about me.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Who’s worried about you?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: My father, mostly. This is his idea.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What about your mother? Isn’t she worried
about you, too?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know, listen. You… You’re a friend
of Dr Crawford, so you’re probably all right, but I’ll be straight with
you, I don’t like this already.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Well, as long as you’re straight.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What do you know about me? Have you talked
to Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Yes. He called me on the phone. He told
me your name and… he told me to look for you. And, uh… he said you had a
brother who died. A… boating accident, wasn’t it? Want to tell me about
it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: How did that go?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It didn’t change anything.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Why do you want to change?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I told you, I’d like to be more in
control.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I told you, so people can quit worrying
about me.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Well. I’ll tell you something. I’ll be
straight with you, okay? I’m not big on control. But it’s your
money.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: So to speak.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: So to speak. Okay…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Twice… a week?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Well. Control’s a tough nut.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’ve got swim practice every night.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Well. That’s a problem. How do we solve
that?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Guess I’ll have to skip practice twice a
week, and come here.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Well. It’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t like being here. I got to tell you I
don’t like being here at all.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Mm-mmm.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I saw Mort Swain. His sister died.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: The one from Idaho?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: The one with the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Did she die in Idaho?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I guess so. Why?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You said she was always traveling. I just…
wondered if she died in Idaho.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe she died in Idaho. Maybe
Kansas City.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I went to see Dr. Berger.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Berger?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Good! You didn’t say anything. Good!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I went.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Today.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I didn’t know you made an appointment.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: How did it go?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: If it’s too much money, I don’t have to go.
It’s not necessary…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Don’t worry about the money, it’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well it’s 50 $ an hour. Twice a week.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Ah, it’s okay. And it is necessary. What did
you talk about?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What about your schedule? Will that be all
right?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well, it’ll cut into swim practice.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Where’s his office?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Highland Park.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: Keep that head straight Genthe! I don’t
want to tell you again!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: Well, are you having fun out there?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Fun?</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: There’s no point if you’re not having
fun. Right?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah. I guess so.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: You guess so…? Are you on medication,
Jarrett? Tranquilizers? Anything?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No. No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: Did I ask you if they gave you shock
out there?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: Yeah what?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah. You asked me. Yeah, they did.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: Don’t look at us, Lazenby! Get your ass
in the water! Look at the bottom of the pool! You know, I’m no doctor,
Jarrett. I would never have let them put electricity in my head.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: God that Salan! He’s such a picky
bastard! He drives me nuts!</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Everybody drives you nuts.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: They look very good.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: Hey, Con, is he giving you a hard
time?</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: He gives everybody a hard time, Dickie.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine’s friend</strong>: You guys don’t want a clarinet,
do you?</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Yeah, Van Buren wants a clarinet.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: I don’t need a clarinet. Who’s
selling it?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine’s friend</strong>: My brother. He needs a
motorcycle.</p>
<p><strong>dickie van buren</strong>: Uh, uh… I need a new pair of
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: You need a new personality.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: You, you stand behind me in the choir.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh? I do? You do? Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: You have a lot of energy.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I do?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Yeah. I mean, That’s good. My name’s
Jeannine Pratt.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Nice. Hi!</p>
<p><strong>jeannine’s friend</strong>: You’re Conrad Jarrett,
remember?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Right. Hum. Yeah. Um. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: “You’ve got a lot of energy.”</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Trick or treat!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You’re the scariest ghost I’ve ever seen! And
the tiger and the witch… You all look just wonderful. Take an apple.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: There you go. Be careful.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Thank you Mrs Jarrett, bye.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>children</strong>: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Know what I’ve been thinking?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Mmm?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: That Christmas in London would be like
something out of Dickens. We’ve never done that before, right? Christmas
in London?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Maybe we shouldn’t plan to go away right
now.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes, we talked about that. We decided on
that.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yeah. I know we talked about it, but the
more I talk about it, the more the timing doesn’t seem right.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Calvin, we’ve always gone away at Christmas
time.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I think… I think it would be good for him too.
Isn’t it time we got back to normal?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: He’s just started with this doctor.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Alright, so he’ll miss three weeks. Why
interrupt it?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No. If he doesn’t go through with this now,
he might change his mind.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Alright then if he changes his mind, maybe
it’s not something that was right for him to do.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You talked to him about it? Does he want to
go to London?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t think he knows what he wants to
do.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Don’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’m sorry, I…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Ha. I didn’t think you were here</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’m sorry, I just got in. I didn’t… I didn’t
know you were here.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I didn’t play golf, today. It’s too cold.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: How’s your golf game?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I didn’t play.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh… It did get colder today.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No, I mean, …for the year it’s colder.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Weren’t you swimming today?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh-huh. Sorry I scared you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Good. I swam well, today.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah. Personaly I think I could swim the 50
if my timing got…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Off.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: …my timing got better. I’m a just a little…
a little off with my… my timing.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well, you have to work at that.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah. Oh, I got seventy four on a trig
quiz.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Seventy four? Gee, I was awful at trig.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh? Did you…? You took Trig?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Wait a minute… Did I take trig? That’s… - uh…?
I bought you two shirts. They’re on your bed.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Who’s gonna be there?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well. The Murrays of course, and the Gunthers,
and the Caines, and… the good old us.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Why don’t we just go to the movies
instead?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Don’t be negative.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: That’s not negative. That’s unpredictable.
Come on. Let’s really go to the movies.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Okay. Yeah. Come on. Let’s go. What’s our
excuse?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Beth wanted to go to the movies?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Good. Very good.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: All right now, smile.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hello Gladyce. Will you put that with the rest
of them?</p>
<p><strong>mrs murray</strong>: Hello! Look who’s here! Three blocks
away and the last to arrive.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Clark! Happy birthday! You look wonderful for
a 75-year-old!</p>
<p><strong>mrs murray</strong>: Yes. It is. Do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You did the mousse? It turned out well?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hey. Partner. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>ray hanley</strong>: Hey, pal!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>woman #1</strong>: Hi. Beth.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Good to see you, and where were you at the
lunch last week?</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: Call your bank and borrow the money.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: I was thinking of going public.</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: I wouldn’t do that, I wouldn’t do it
now…</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: …because the market’s low.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Your hair looks wonderful. It’s shorter, isn’t
it? I like that.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: I said: “Would you please put out your
cigar?” and he says: “Huh?”. I said: “Would you put out your cigar?”, he
says: “Huh?”. I said: “Would you please put out your cigar?”, he says: ”
I don’t have another one!”</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Good to see you! You look beautiful. As
ever.</p>
<p><strong>man #4</strong>: It’s a macho factor. When these kids are at
school, they just think they’ve got to walk on the edge of danger.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What are these hushed tones all about?</p>
<p><strong>woman #</strong>: He just told the funniest joke!</p>
<p><strong>man #4</strong>: I’m not talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>woman #2</strong>: Obviously, you know, I have my fingers
crossed on this merger.</p>
<p><strong>murray</strong>: When can we have lunch?</p>
<p><strong>man #3</strong>: Great. Fill me in the office, I have no idea
of my schedule, but I’m free almost everyday.</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: I ran into Billy white. Bob Mc Lean’s
leaving Coles and Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Where is he going?</p>
<p><strong>man #2</strong>: He doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No. You didn’t. You’re so mean. Isn’t he the
meanest man you’ve met?</p>
<p><strong>man #5</strong>: When a ball is in play, if a player, his
partner, their equipment or their caddies accidentally move it…</p>
<p><strong>guests</strong>: He’s a jolly good fellow For he’s a jolly
good fellow Won’t regret, can’t forget What we did for love</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hi. Annie. What’s your boy up to these
days?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Oh. Who knows? They won’t tell. How’s Conrad
doing?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: He’s great. Just great.</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: I asked Donald, and he says they haven’t
talked much. I said maybe he’s a little self-conscious.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Really? Is he still having some problems?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh, no, no. Nothing like that. No, no, just
somebody to talk to… that’s all. Kind of polish off the rough edges,
that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How are you. Darling? Is he falling asleep on
you, yet?</p>
<p><strong>annie</strong>: Nah. He’s great.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Mr. Great. That’s me!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hey?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You drink too much at parties, Calvin.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I’m not drunk.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why did you tell Annie Marshall that Conrad is
seeing a psychiatrist?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I dunno. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well for one thing, I don’t think people hear
that kind of thing very easily.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Come on, for most people, it’s a status
symbol, right up there with going to Europe.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well, I thought your blurting it out like that
was in very bad taste…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I did not think it was that…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Not to mention a violation of privacy!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Whose privacy?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Our privacy! The family’s privacy! I think it
is a very private matter.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: So what do I do… tell you my dreams?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: I don’t hold much stock in dreams.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What kind of a psychiatrist are you? They
all believe in dreams.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Really? What’s happening? What’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I just feel… I feel so…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Jumpy. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Look. Kiddo… I lied. I do believe in
dreams. Only sometimes I want to know what’s happening when you’re
awake. Come on, something’s bugging you, making you nervous. You’re
making me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Maybe I need a tranquilizer.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Tranquilizer?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: I think you came in here looking like
something out of The Body Snatchers. It’s not my impression that you
need a tranquilizer.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Clock.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh, I see. So you get to tell the time, but
I can’t. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Mmm, mmm.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: So you know when the hour’s up?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Fifty minutes, fifty five minutes? What is
it?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: They’re a bunch of boring ass jocks.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: And him… I can’t stand him. He’s a tight ass
son of a bitch!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Ah, ah?… Have you ever thought about
quitting?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Are you telling me to?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It wouldn’t look good.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Forget about how it looks! How does it
feel?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: How does it feel? How does it feel?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: How does it feel?!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Yes! How does it feel?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It’s the same thing that happened last year…
It’s the same damn thing I did last year.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Are you the same person you were last
year?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: That’s why you need a tranquilizer?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You tell me!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: No. It’s up to you!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Fifty bucks an hour, can’t you decide if I
should have a pill or not? I mean, you’re a doctor, I’m supposed to feel
better! Right?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Not necessarily.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No. It’s still hard.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Is anyplace easy?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: The hospital was.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: It was? Why?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Because nobody hid anything there.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Was there anyone there you could talk
to?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: I mean, besides Dr. Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hey, Karen! Hi! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Good. Real good.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Sit down. Please.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: When did you get back?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh… The end of August.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: God…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It’s great to see you.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh, you too. Listen. I am not gonna be able
to stay a real long time. I’ve got a meeting over at school. Drama Club
meeting. We’re doing “A Thousand Clowns” this year. You know it? Anyway.
We’re going so crazy trying to get it together. I am secretary this year
too.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Don’t let me hang you up.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No. Oh, no, you’re not hanging me up! No, I
really wanted to see you. I didn’t know quite what to expect, though… I
mean, you sounded…uh, you sounded sort of funny on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No, no, I wasn’t. It was just a gray day,
that’s all. Kind of… But everything’s great, I’m back in school, I am on
the swim team, and…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Oh. You’re swimming? Terrific, Conrad!
That’s… That’s really wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: We haven’t had any meets yet. I could end up
on the bench all year, but…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Come on, you’ll do great. I’ll bet your folks
are real proud of you.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: What can I get you guys?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You’re hungry, at all?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Uh… I just want a coke.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh… two cokes, please.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You think we offended him?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Something I said? Definitely a low
self-image day.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So. Uh…</p>
<p><strong>conrad karen</strong>: - Are you… - What did…</p>
<p><strong>conrad karen</strong>: I can’t believe how beautiful You know
what I really wanted you look. to…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You really look beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: So do you.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Do you miss it?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Miss what?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: The hospital.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You don’t miss it? At all? Nothing? Nothing
about it?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You don’t miss Leo’s corny jokes?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Are you seeing a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah. I’m seeing a doctor. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Uh… Uh, well, Dr. Crawford gave me a name,
and I went for a while. But uh… I dunno.It just didn’t work for me, I
guess. He just kept telling me all the things I already knew, and , uh…
finally, I decided… the only one who can help me is myself. At least,
that’s what my dad says. I don’t mean it’s not right for you, Conrad. I
mean I think that if it’s something you want to do, that’s what you
should be doing.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well, ya, I don’t know how long I’ll keep it
up. I sorta got shoved into it.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Your hair grew in.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh, yes. That was such a dumb thing to
do.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I like it.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know, I just… Uh… I miss it
sometimes, the hospital. Really do.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Things have to change. You know?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: But that’s where we had the laughs.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: But that was a hospital. This is the real
world.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I… you’re sure right.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I really have to go. I’m sorry. I have a
meeting over at the school. Drama Club meeting. We’re doing “A Thousand
Clowns”.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I know, you told me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Did I?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I better hurry. Don’t wanna be late.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Thanks for seeing me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Conrad? Let’s have a great Christmas! Okay?
Let’s have… a great year. Let’s have the best year of our whole lives,
OK? We can, you know. This could be the best year ever.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah… Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You mean it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yep!</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You. Uh… You look good. Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s cold out here. You should put that on, or
do you want a sweater?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Do I need one?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Nothing. Thinking.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Not about anything.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Your hair is starting to grow out. It’s
looking… looking better.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I was thinking about the pigeon… You know
the one that used to hang around the garage. How it used to get on top
of your car, and he take off when you pulled out of the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh. Yeah, I remember. I remember how scared I
used to get… That whosssshhhhh! Flap, flap, flap, flap!… Every time I
started the car.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah. That was the closest we ever came to
having a pet. You remember Buck asked you, he tried to talk you into…
getting a dog. Do you remember that? He said. “How about it, if it’s the
size of a little football?”</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You know. Uh… That animal next door, that
Pepper or Pippin, whatever its name is…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Pippin. Pippin. Pippin!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: He’s not a very friendly dog… I… I don’t care
what Mr. McGreary says.</p>
<p><strong>conrad beth</strong>: - What he really wanted was a -
Everytime time that dog retriever. It was down the comes into this
backyard, I street for sale. That’s what try to get him out… he wanted.
A retriever.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Arf! Arf! Arf!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Put that on if you’re gonna stay out here,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Can I help?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Help what? Oh, you mean with this? No.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No, I tell you what you can do though. You can
go upstairs to that room of yours and clean out the closet.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Mom…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Okay? Because it really is a mess.</p>
<p><strong>buck</strong>: Oh anyway, Mary Ann Ramon started to just
scream, just cry, right? It was crazy. We got so drunk that we couldn’t
talk to each other. It was the last day… the last day of school.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh, Bucky!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No. Stop!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What do you expect from her?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: We just don’t connect.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know. We just don’t.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: That I jack off a lot.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: So what else is new? Does it help?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: For a minute.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: John Boy.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You know, in “The Waltons”. John Boy?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Yeah. What about him?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: My father came into my room and he didn’t
know what to say. This is right after Buck died. And he came over and
sat on the bed next to me, put his arm around my shoulder. We just sat
there. I remember I was watching his shoe. And thinking… Cos his shoe
was turned over on its side. I was thinking: “He’s so uptight, it’s
gonna crack off.”</p>
<p><strong>56 continued: 56</strong>: CONRAD</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: So much as what?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I dunno. I kept thinking that John Boy
would’ve said something…about the way he felt, you know. Something.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What would John Boy have said?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Come on what?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Don’t hold back.</p>
<p><strong>ray hanley</strong>: Well. At least she’s an improvement. She
doesn’t crack gum in your face. That’s what you get when your partner
does the hiring and firing.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. That’s my fault. I just can
never seem to tell anybody that they’re not making it.</p>
<p><strong>ray hanley</strong>: Hold, hold it. Wait a minute. That’s not
the problem. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ray hanley</strong>: I’ve been losing you these days.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ray hanley</strong>: That’s okay. That’s okay. You off the
track?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>ray hanley</strong>: Come on. I’ve known you for twenty
years. You think I can’t tell when something’s wrong? How’s Connie?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Connie’s all right. He is. He’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>ray hanley</strong>: Look, I am sorry, it’s none of my
business, but I think you worry too much. You’ve been on the rack about
him long enough. You’re making it a habit. You’ve gotta let him go
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I’m not on the rack about him.</p>
<p><strong>ray hanley</strong>: The thing about it is, in a year he’ll
be gone. Off to Michigan or Harvard or wherever in the hell he gets it
in his head he wants to go. Maybe he’ll decide to take a tour of Europe
for a year and not even go to school at all. Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I can’t argue with “Who knows.”</p>
<p><strong>ray hanley</strong>: I’m just try giving you the benefit of
my experience.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ray hanley</strong>: With Valerie, it’s more than her living
away from home… She’s gone. Got her own friends, her own life. She
breezes in …for a couple of days on vacations, but… I don’t know, maybe
girls are different. Or maybe she was too aware of what was happening
between Nance and me. But they leave… And all that worrying doesn’t
amount to a hill of crap. It’s just wasted energy.</p>
<p><strong>young conrad</strong>: Give me back my sweater! Come on, it’s
my sweater!</p>
<p><strong>young buck</strong>: Possession is nine tenths…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hang on!</p>
<p><strong>young buck</strong>: Dad, what’s possession?</p>
<p><strong>young conrad</strong>: Give it to me!</p>
<p><strong>young buck</strong>: I can’t, it’s already on me.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Wait, hang on! Whose sweater is it?</p>
<p><strong>young conrad</strong>: It’s my sweater!</p>
<p><strong>young buck</strong>: OK! Alright! I’ll give it back to you…
as long as you give me back my hockey stick and my skis.</p>
<p><strong>young conrad</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: That’s fair!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Conrad! Conrad!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>ambulance man</strong>: Watch your back. Cuts are vertical.
He really meant business.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Lake Forest is next. Lake Forest.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: What it is you want? I don’t know what
else to do for you.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’m not asking you for anything.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: You gotta be kidding me. I don’t get
it. I excuse you from practice twice a week so you can see some shrink.
I work with you every damn night at your convenience. What the hell more
am I supposed to do for you?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: Bright kid like you, everything going
for you. See, I don’t get it. Why do you wanna keep messing up your
life?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t think that …that quitting swimming
will mess up my life. I… I really don’t.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: Okay. Okay. Now, this is it.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: You’re a big kid now.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh, uh.</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: Actions have consequences.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Okay!</p>
<p><strong>coach salan</strong>: I’m not taking you back again. You’ll
remember that?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I won’t ask you to …sir.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: What happened? You all right?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: Salan says you quit the swim team.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know. I felt like it was a bore.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: That’s not a real reason!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well, that’s the way it is.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: So what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: Connie, come on, talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Nothing. Swimming’s a bore. That’s all.</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: Well listen, I talked to Salan…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well, quit talking to people! Okay?</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: Holy shit! Yeah. Sure. Fuck you.
Jarrett.</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Ooh! Ohh!</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: Shut up. Leave it alone.</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: I told you. The guy’s a flake.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: So, what did your dad say about it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I haven’t told him yet.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know. The timing isn’t right, you
know. He sweats everything so much, he’ll just get worried about it.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Can you tell your mother?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: My mother? My mother and I don’t connect.
Don’t you listen? I told you that.</p>
<p><strong>66 continued: 66</strong>: CONRAD</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: No. Sorry’s out. Come on, something’s on
your mind.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: No, no, never mind the time. There’s
time. Look. Remember the contract? Control? Maybe there’s some
connection between control and uh… � what do we call it? - lack of
feeling? Mmm?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I said I feel things.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Ah, God… Come on.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Sometimes. I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Come on, come on, Jarrett, I thought you
didn’t like to fool around.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t? I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Like to play games, do you?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: I’ll tell you what I want. I want you to
leave “I don’t know” out there on the table with the magazines.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah, and if I don’t have an answer you want
me to make one up?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Yeah. That would be nice. Make one up.
Right now. About how there’s no feelings in there.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I said I have feelings.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Oh! Now you have, now you don’t! Get it
together, Jarrett.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Why you hassle me? Why are you trying to
make me mad?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Are you mad?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Oh, cut the shit! You’re mad! You’re mad
as hell! You don’t like being pushed. So why don’t you do something
about it!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Tell me to fuck off! I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well, fuck off! No. No, I can’t, I can’t do
this.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I can’t…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I can’t do this. It takes too much energy to
get mad!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Do you know how much energy it takes to
hold it back?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: When I let myself feel low, I feel as
lousy.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Oh! I beg your pardon! I never promised
you a rose garden…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Fuck you. Berger!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: That’s it!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Jesus, you’re really weird! What about you?
What do you feel, huh? Do you jack off or jerk off? Whatever you call
it?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What do I think? I think you married your
fat lady… and you goona over fuck the daylights out of her!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Sounds good to me.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Ah! Ha! Ha…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: A little advice about feeling, kiddo…
Don’t expect it always to tickle.</p>

<p><strong>grandfather grandmother</strong>: This is beautiful. Hold it
Shut up! Wonderful. OK, now I level, would you? want to take Cal and

<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Ohhh!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Connie. I want one of Connie and his
mother.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No, I tell you what. Let’s get the three men
in there, and I’ll take a picture of you.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Connie, move in a little closer to your
mother. Okay… prize winner…</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Yeah. That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Portrait…</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: It’s great.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Do it.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Page one, Lake Forrester…</p>
<p><strong>grandfather grandmother</strong>: Ain’t it mother? Yes. It’s
marvellous. I love</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Calvin…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hold it. Connie, smile!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Calvin!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Just a second, smile!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Calvin, give me the camera.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No, I didn’t get it yet , Beth.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Come on, give me the camera.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Dad, give her the camera.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I want a really good picture of the two of
you, OK?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No but I really want a shot of the three of
you men. Give me the camera, Calvin. Please…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Not until I get a picture of the two of
you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Cal?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Smile.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Beth?!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I think it can be saved.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Have you talked to his teachers?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t think people want to be with him. He
provokes people.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Well. / Why don’t you do this? / It’s
an awkward age.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Maybe he needs a change. Are you sure
he’s eating enough?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes, Mother, of course.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: I think he’ll be all right - if you’re
firm with him, mmm?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I think maybe he should go away to school. I
just don’t know how to deal with him any more.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Who would make that decision?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t know. I suppose this doctor he’s
seeing.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: What sort of doctor… would make that
decision for you?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: A psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: I thought we were all finished with
that.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: What’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Berger.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: Jewish doctor?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I dunno, I suppose he’s Jewish. Maybe just
German.</p>
<p><strong>grandmother</strong>: What does Cal say about all this?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You know, I think this can be saved. It’s a
nice clean break.</p>
<p><strong>choir</strong>: Alleluia, Amen. Amen. Alleluia, Amen.
Aaaaaamen.</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: Okay. Altos, that last “E” natural could
be just a little higher. Officers, don’t forget your meeting tonight.
That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Mmm mm mmm, Mmm mm mmm, Mmm mmm Mmm mm
mmm.</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: Hi. Jeannine!</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: You are really a terrific tenor.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh…</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: In fact. You should be doing the solo in
that Russian thing.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Ha, no. I…</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: No. I’m serious. You really sing well. I’m
getting to know your voice.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: How can you hear me sing if you’re
singing?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Well… I don’t always sing. Sometimes I
just listen.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: For instance, Marcia Blair can’t sing a
note.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh, uh…</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Janet Fox only mouths the words and never
sings.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Ha, ha? Ha, a detective?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Do you like Vivaldi?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh…</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Telemann?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Telemann? Um…</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: What kind of music do you like?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh. Uh… Modern jazz. I like. Folk rock.
Spoon on a glass.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Spoon on a …glass?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Mmmm. You make it look easy.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Ah. You’re just saying that?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Alleluia! Ah ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Ha,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia, Alleluia!
Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Alleluia!</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hello. Is Karen there?</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: Who’s calling, please?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It’s a friend of hers from Hillsboro?</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: Oh… Well, she’s …not home from
school yet.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh. Um…Hmm. Just tell her I called. This is
Conrad. Calling. Just tell her I called and I’m feeling great, and I
just wanted to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: Yes. I will.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: OK. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>karen’s mother</strong>: Good bye.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: All right</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hello. This is… Hello, this is Conrad
calling. Jarrett?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Oh… Oh. Hi!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hi. Listen. I was… I was wondering if maybe
you’d like…to go out sometime?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: You mean, with you? Like on a date?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well, yeah, we wouldn’t have to call it a
real date. We could fake it sort of, to see how it goes..</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: That was dumb. Forget it. Just forget it.
Now start over.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hi, this is Conrad Jarrett…</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: I’d love to. When?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I didn’t see you there. What do you
think?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Rawlins used to have such great Scotch
pines. And they all look like skeletons this year.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hi. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Very nice.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why don’t you ask him what’s wrong? Maybe you
won’t have to hear it from Carol Lazenby.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Hear what?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Dad, I quit the swim team.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Carol thought I knew. Cos why wouldn’t I? It
happened over a month ago.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Quit? When? Where have you been every
night?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Nowhere. Around. The library mostly.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Why didn’t you tell us, Connie?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know, I didn’t think it
mattered.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What do you mean? Why wouldn’t it matter? Of
course it matters. And…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No, that was meant for me, Calvin.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What was meant for you?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s really important to try to hurt me. Isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Don’t you have that backwards?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh? And how do I hurt you? By embarrassing you
in front of a friend? Poor Beth! She has no idea what her son is up to!
He lies and she believes every word of it.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I didn’t lie!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: You did! You lied everytime you came into this
house at 6:30 ! If it’s starting all over again, the lying, the covering
up, the disappearing for hours, I will not stand for it! I can’t stand
it! I really can’t!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well don’t then! Go to Europe!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Connie! Now, Connie! Connie!…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Cos the only reason she cares, the only
reason she gives a fuck about it…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Connie!…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: …is because someone else knew about it
first!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Just stop it, Connie! …</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No! You tell her to stop it! You never tell
her a godamn thing! And I know why she never came to the hospital, she’s
busy going to goddamn Spain and… goddamn Portugal! Why should she care
if I’m hung up by the balls out there?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Maybe this is how they sit around and talk at
the hospital, but we’re not at the hospital now.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You never came to the hospital!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: How do you know she never came? You know she
came but she had the flu and couldn’t come inside, but she came.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah! She wouldn’t have had any flu if Buck
was in the hospital! She would have come if Buck was in the
hospital!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Buck never would’ve been in the hospital!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: That’s enough! That is enough!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I won’t do it again. I really won’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What in hell has happened?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Ah! Oh, god, that’s the pattern, isn’t it? He
walks all over us and then you go up and apologize to him.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I am not going to apologize…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yes of course you are! You always do! You’ve
been apologizing to him ever since he got home from the hospital, only
you don’t see it!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I am not apologizing. I’m trying to goddamn
understand him!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Don’t talk to me that way. Don’t you talk to
me the way he talks to you!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Beth. Let’s not fight. Okay? No fighting.
Okay? Please. Let’s go upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I need to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: In a minute…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I didn’t mean it. I didn’t mean any of it. I
am sorry. Please don’t be mad.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I’m not mad ! I’m just trying to figure out
what happened down there.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know what happened! I am sorry about
it all. I am sorry about the whole thing. What I said, I didn’t mean it.
Just please tell her. Tell her I’m sorry, will you?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Why don’t you tell her?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh, God, no, I can’t! Don’t you see? I can’t
talk to her!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Ha! Because it doesn’t change anything. It
doesn’t change the way she looks at me.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: She was upset, Conrad. Your mother was hurt
because you quit the swim team. I don’t understand it myself.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t mean just now. Don’t you see? I
don’t mean just today.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What then? Explain it to me.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Ha! I can’t! Everything is German pudding
with you , dad. You don’t see things!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What things?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: That she hates me! Can’t you see that?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Your mother doesn’t hate you, Conrad?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: All right, all right. You’re right. She
doesn’t. Please leave me alone, now.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What about this Dr. Berger? Do you think
he’s helping you?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Don’t blame it on Burger, it’s not his
fault!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I’ll be downstairs if you need me.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Tuesday you felt great. You bought a
Christmas tree, it was all hunky- dory. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You’re the doctor.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Don’t take refuge in one-liners like
“You’re the doctor”. Okay? Because that pisses me off.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: So everything was fine till you had the
fight with your mother, then everything was lousy.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah, but I don’t blame her. I mean, she’s
got… She’s got her reasons. It’s impossible after all the shit I’ve
pulled!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What shit have you pulled? Hey! Remember!
I’m talking proportion here. Now, what shit?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Lately?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Uh, uh.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hey, come on, if you… Listen, I’m never
gonna be forgiven for that. Never! You know, you can’t get it out, you
know, all the blood in her towels, in her rug. Everything had to be
pitched. Even the tiles in the bathroom had to be regrouted. Christ, she
fired the godamn maid because she couldn’t dust the living room right.
If you think I’m gonna forgive… - that she’s gonna forgive me…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I think I just figured something out.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Who it is who can’t forgive who…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Well a real problem… a real problem has a
real solution.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’ve heard this all before.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Doesn’t make it any less true.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’m so tired.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Yeah, well… that’s a hell of a secret
you’ve been keeping on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: So what do I do now?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Recognize her limitations.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You mean, like she can’t love me?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Oh, kiddo, no. Like she can’t love you
enough. Like don’t blame her for not loving you more than she’s
able.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: But she loves my father. I know she loved my
brother. It’s me!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Ha! Now we’re back to the rotten kid
routine! She can’t love you because you’re unlovable. Where does that
leave your dad? How come he loves you? You’re a rottenkid, doesn’t he
know that?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: That’s different. He feels responsible.
Besides, he loves everybody.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Ho, I get it! The guy’s got no taste! He
loves you, but he’s wrong. Look… maybe she just can’t express it the way
you’d like her to. Maybe she’s just afraid to show you what she
feels.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: I mean there’s someone besides your
mother you’ve got to forgive.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You mean me?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Why don’t you give yourself a break? Let
yourself off the hook?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: We’ll talk about it on Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Time’s up.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What do you mean? You’re gonna pull the
plug… Come on! What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Come on, Con. You know the rules.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Rules? What rules? Can’t I have a few
minutes?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: You think about it. Just think about
it.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: Say. After going to a new high, it falls to
112 1/4 and then rallies on good volume. I shoot an order to buy 4000 at
the market. If I get the 4000 shares at 113 3/4, I know something’s
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>77 continued: 77</strong>: FRIEND</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: I’ll see you, Cal.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p>****: Suppose the order to buy 4000 at 113 3/4…</p>
<p>****: He walks all over us and you go up there and apologize to
him…</p>
<p>****: 500 at 114…</p>
<p>****: It’s all German pudding with you, dad, you don’t see
things.</p>
<p>****: You’ve been apologizing to him ever since he came home from the
hospital. And you just don’t see that!</p>
<p>****: Tell her to stop it! You never tell her a godamn thing!</p>
<p>****: Buck never would have been in the hospital!</p>
<p>****: She hates me! Can’t you see that?</p>
<p>****: I want to be clear.</p>
<p>****: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: In the car, I was thinking: “be clear.”. I
suppose that’s what psychiatry’s about. Being precise and clear. And
honest, of course. I’ll level with you. I’m not a great believer in
psychiatry.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I know what happens here is only between you
and him, and…I like that, I respect that. And…he’s better, I can see
that. I am not trying to put you down, I just don’t believe in
psychiatry as a panacea for everybody.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I wish I knew what the hell I was doing
here.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Well, you said you… thought you could
shed some light on some things. What did you mean by that?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I don’t know actually, I’m not sure, I think
I meant in terms of Conrad. You see, I knew something was wrong even
before he tried to… to kill himself. But I thought that… It’s clear that
he’s very smart. He’s been an “A” student ever since he started school,
and naturally I thought that …intelligent people could work out their
own problems.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: But you still feel responsible?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yeah, sure I do. It’s hard not to. It was
luck. It was just luck that I happened to be there when he tried it. I
could have been at a meeting. We both could’ve been away. It was
luck!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: You think of yourself as a lucky man,
then?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No! No. No. I used to. I used to think… that
I was a lucky person… before… the “accident”. Mmm, I guess the whole of
life is nothing but an accident, is it? What happens to you. I should do
with it.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: That sounds more like the philosophy of a
drifter than a tax attorney.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yeah. Maybe, maybe I am drifting a little. I
can see myself, …and I can see the two of them drifting away from me,
and I just stand there watching.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What would you want to do about that?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Something. I gotta do something about it. I
don’t know what.</p>
<p><strong>77 continued: 77</strong>: CALVIN</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: And you see them as on …opposite sides of
this fence?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Yeah… No. I don’t know. I see her not being
able to forgive him.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh, I don’t know exactly. Being too much
like her. People always think that she and Buck are… were …were alike.
But it’s really she and Conrad. They were the only two that didn’t cry
at the funeral, you know? It’s not easy for me to admit this but, uh…
she didn’t… His mother doesn’t show him a great deal of affection. I’m
not trying to put her down in any way at all. She is a wonderful woman,
huh…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Did she give Buck much affection to
…Buck?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh, god, yes, she loved Buck! Bucky got so
much… I think what she felt for him was special. You know, he was her
first-born. That’s not unusual, is it?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: And you?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Me? I loved Buck.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What I mean is, your wife’s
affection.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: For me you mean?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Mmm. She’s very… No. There’s no problem with
her for me. We’ve been… We’ve been married nearly twenty one years.
Everybody loves Beth. But, huh… for Conrad, - it’s been difficult. He
didn’t talk about that? We don’t know what happens here. It doesn’t come
up. I guess that’s what it is. It’s private here. Isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Mm-hmm. Very private.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I think I know why I came here. I think I
came here to talk about myself.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Okay. Why don’t we?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: This will sound strange.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Could we talk about Buck’s funeral?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I know it’ll seem trivial, but it’s on my
mind, or has been, and I’d just like to talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: When I was getting dressed for Buck’s
funeral, I was…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Calvin, what’s the matter with you?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Just let me get it off my chest,OK?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What could getting dressed for Buck’s funeral
possibly have to do with anything right now?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I was wearing a blue shirt. And you said: -
Wear a white shirt and the other shoes! It was nothing at the time. But
it’s always seemed to stay with me. And I, for some reason, been
thinking about it and it suddenly occured to me what difference did it
make what I wore at Buck’s funeral?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Ha, ha.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Just hear me out, Beth! It won’t hurt you to
listen!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I won’t listen to that! No one in their right
mind would listen to that.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I just want to talk about something I always
remembered.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why do you want to remind me of it?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Because I’ve always wondered, in some
needling way, what it mattered what I wore. I was crazy that day. We
were going to our son’s funeral. And you were worried about what I wore
on my feet. I’m sure it sounds like nothing to you, but it sticks with
me and I just wanted to …tell you about it.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>caroll</strong>: Beth! Beth! Hi! How are you?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Caroll! I’m fine. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>caroll</strong>: I haven’t seen you!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I know. I’m so busy. I promise I’ll call you
soon and we’ll have lunch.</p>
<p><strong>caroll</strong>: Right!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: How’s Brad? Give him my love.</p>
<p><strong>caroll</strong>: Fabulous! Is everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Isn’t this madness? It gets worse every
year!</p>
<p><strong>caroll</strong>: Good-bye!</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: May I show you this in your size?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>saleswoman</strong>: May I show you this dress in your
size?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh… No, no. No. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We’ve got Bennett’s, and Grant’s and Foley’s.
Ha, Conrad should get something for my mother and father. He’s not
supposed to get something for his doctor, is he?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I don’t think so. I think we should go see
him, Beth. - Dr. Berger.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I think we could all go and see him
together.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: He thinks it’s a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Ho… He thinks it’s a good idea? What does he
know about me, about this family? I’ve never even met him.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Exactly. That’s the point. Wouldn’t it be
easier if we all talked about it? In the open.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: About what? What are we gonna talk about?
Don’t try to change me, Calvin. I don’t want anymore changes in my life.
For God’s sake, hasn’t enough happened? Let’s just hold on to what we’ve
got!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Darling, that is what this is for. Maybe
you’ll get a surprise.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t want any surprises. I know I’m not
perfect. And if I can’t go around hugging everybody all the time the way
you do, then I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I am not asking you to be perfect, you’re
missing the point.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t want to see any doctors or counselors.
I am me. This is my family. And if we have problems, then we will solve
those problems in the privacy of our own home, not by running to some
kind of specialist everytime something goes wrong…</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Are you folks ready to order?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Huh, no… Could you give me a couple of
minutes, please?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: …running to experts every time something goes
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I do too. I want all of them to be nice
Christmases</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We need time together, Calvin. You and I. We
have to get away. New Years’. We can spend some time in Houston with my
brother and Audrey. You know, play a little golf. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Okay. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Let’s just give things time. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Conrad?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: I don’t bowl. I mean, I’m a horrible
bowler.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh, that’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Yeah. Well…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well, listen. We don’t have to go bowling if
you’d rather not, I’m not a bowling nut or anything. How funny are
you?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: On a scale from one to ten? … About a
ten.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hoo, that’s pretty funny. Hey, well, listen,
I promise you won’t look silly.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Guarantee it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Guarantee it.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Can you ever break the ball?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Can’t break the ball, can’t break the floor,
can’t break anything in a bowling alley. And that’s what I like about
bowling alleys. Can’t even break the record.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Hmm? What?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Just “anyway”, it’s a conversation
starter.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Catchy!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Mmm, mmm.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I thought it’d get to you. I’ve been working
on it all day.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Do you think people are punished for the
things they do?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You mean by God?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Mmm, I don’t believe in God.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Not at all?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No. Well, it’s not a question of degree.
Either you do or you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: I believe in God.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: So you’re afraid he’ll punish you for
something you did?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: I’ve done a lot of things I’m ashamed
of.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah? So have I.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Did it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No, I dunno, I don’t remember really.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: You don’t want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Ah, I don’t know… I’ve never really talked
about it. To doctors, but not to anyone else. You’re the first who’s
asked.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh… I don’t know. It was like… falling into
a hole. It was like falling into a hole, and it keeps getting bigger and
bigger, .and you can’t get out, and then, .all of a sudden, it’s
inside…and you’re the hole, and you’re trapped, and it’s all over.
Something like that. And it’s not really scary, except it is when you
think back on it. ’Cause you know what you were feeling stange and
new…</p>
<p><strong>84 continued: 84</strong>: STUDENTS</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Hey. Jarrett. How you doing? How about some

<p><strong>stillman</strong>: You’re the prick. Guys like you walk
around like you’re king shit. You give me a goddamn pain in the ass, you
think we owe you…</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: Come on! Connie. Come on! Cool it, Jarrett!
Connie! Connie. That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>students</strong>: No, Stillman, no! No!</p>
<p><strong>stillman</strong>: Let go! Let go!</p>
<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: It’s all right! He’s crazy! Just calm down,

<p><strong>lazenby</strong>: No, it isn’t. What is it with you? Huh? I
don’t know why you want to be in this alone? You know, I miss him too.
Connie, the three of us were best friends!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I can’t help it, it hurts too much to be

<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I need… I need…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Just wait till we get inside…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Shit. You’d think they’d assume there’d
be an emergency now and then?!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Something happened!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It’s…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: It’s what?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh. God! I need something.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What do you need? Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It just keeps coming! I can’t… I can’t make
it stop!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Don’t try.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I gotta… I gotta… I gotta get off the hook
for it. I gotta get off the hook!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: For what I did!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: What I did to him!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It’s something… It’s something… Don’t you
see? It’s gotta be somebody’s fault or there’s no godamm point!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Point? What point? It happened!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No, no… Oh, no. I don’t mean that. It’s
that… It’s just that… Buck, Bucky, I didn’t mean it!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Bucky, I didn’t mean it!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Bucky!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: I know that, it wasn’t your fault.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: But it was: you said. “Get the sail down!”
…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: …and I couldn’t!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I couldn’t! It jammed! And then the halyard,
the halyard jammed! I couldn’t because the godamn halyard jammed! And
then you’re sittin’ here, you’re screwing around…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: …until it’s too late to do anything! And I’m
supposed to take care of it!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: And I’m supposed to take care of it!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: And that wasn’t fair, was it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No! And then you say …</p>
<p>****: “Hang on!”…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: …“Hang on!”, and then you let go!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Why’d you let go?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Because I got tired!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah? Well. Screw you, you jerk!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: It hurts to be mad at him, doesn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah. He just wasn’t careful. He just
wouldn’t care. He didn’t see how a bad thing might happen.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Bad things happen even when people are
careful.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: We were screwing around out there, we
should’ve come in when it started to look bad.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: OK, so you made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Why did he let go? Why?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Maybe you were stronger. Did it ever
occur to you that you might have been stronger?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh, God, I’d like to quit.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Why don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It’s not easy. It’s not that easy. God… I
loved him.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Ka-ren. She killed herself! I just found out
she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: And she was fine, she was OK.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: No. She wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: She was! She was! She told me! She said she
was…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: She was busy, she was feeling good and
she…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: And what?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I just wish I’d known…I could’ve done
something.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: You saw her once and now you’ want to
take her on too?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No. I just…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: That isn’t it. I… I feel bad about this, I
feel really bad about this. And just let me feel bad about this!</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Okay. Listen. I feel bad about it
too.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Why do things have to happen to people? It
isn’t fair.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: You’re right. It isn’t fair.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You just do one wrong thing… and…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Um-hmm. And what was the one wrong thing
you did?</p>
<p>****: Haaa…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: You know.</p>
<p>****: Haaa…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Haaa…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: You know.</p>
<p>****: Haaa…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I hung on. I stayed with the boat.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p>****: Haaa…</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Now. You can live with that. Can’t
you?</p>
<p>****: Haaa…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’m scared! I’m scared.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Feelings are scary. And sometimes they’re
painful. And if you can’t feel pain, then you’re not gonna feel anything
else either. You know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I think so.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: You’re here and you’re alive. And don’t
tell me you don’t feel that.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: It doesn’t feel good.</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: It is good. Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: How do you know?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: Because I’m your friend.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I don’t know what I would’ve done…if you
hadn’t been here. You’re really my friend?</p>
<p><strong>dr berger</strong>: I am. Count on it.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Hi. I was gonna call but I didn’t want to
wake anyone.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Might have been easier…</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Listen, I want to say something about the
other night. I mean I liked being with you but I didn’t like myself.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Conrad. I was stupid. That was dumb of me
to laugh and it was my fault. I just didn’t know what to do. I was
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Really? You were embarrassed?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Yes. When those boys came in, it was awful
and awkward. That’s what I do when I get embarrassed. I laugh.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: But they were all right. They were just up
and they were having a good time, and I let them get in the way of what
was happening. It was dumb. It was dumb. I’ve been doing lots of dumb
things lately. I just didn’t know wether or not you were being straight
with me.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Uh… Are you going to school?</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: No, not on Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No. I haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Do you want some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>jeannine</strong>: Mom!</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: Oh !…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: All right. How about that?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Boy, oh, boy.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh, I do love that.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh, these holes sure do love you. Oh boy, oh
boy.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: We should spend more time playing golf
together, you know that? Maybe our next vacation, strictly golf.
Pinehurst, Myrtle Beach…</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Pinehurst would be nice. I think Connie
would like Pinehurst.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Do you do that deliberately or is it just a
reflex?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well, you said “vacation”, so I just assumed
you meant him too.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I’m surprised you haven’t felt the need to
call him since we’ve been here.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I was gonna call him tonight.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hey, could we have a little drink before we
head back?</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: Drink, yes. Little, no. What’d you get? Cal,
what’d you get?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Six. Let’s finish this.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What you started.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What I started?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: What you started.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Ha! There’s no point discussing it.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I think there is a point.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: He controls you even when you are two thousand
miles away.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: He isn’t the problem.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No, he isn’t. Let’s talk about what’s really
bothering you.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No, no. Let’s talk about what’s bothering you.
Cos’ that’s what you want, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Jesus, what have I done to make you so angry
with me?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: It’s not what you’ve done, it’s what you think
I’ve done. You blame me for the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Can’t you see anything except in terms of
how it affects you?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: No! I can’t! And neither can you, and neither
can anybody else! Only maybe I’m just a little more honest about it!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well, stop being so godamn honest, and start
being a little generous! And start thinking about him for a while!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t know what he expects from me. I never
have known.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you what he expects!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What? He wants me to throw my arms around him
everytime he passes an exam? Well, I can’t do it! I cannot respond when
someone says: “Here, I just did this great thing. Love me.”. I
can’t!</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: All he wants… All he wants is to know you
don’t hate him. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hate him? My God! How could I hate him?
Mothers don’t hate their sons! Is that what he told you? Do you see how
you accept what he says with no questions, and you can’t do the same
thing to me, can you?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I just try to keep this family together…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I don’t know what everyone wants from me
anymore!</p>
<p><strong>audrey</strong>: Beth, nobody wants anything from you.</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: Beth, listen. We all just want… Cal, Con,
everybody, we just want you to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Happy?</p>
<p><strong>ward</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Ward, you tell me the definition of happy, uh?
But first, you better make sure that your kids are good and safe, that
no one’s fallen off a horse, or been hit by a car, or drowned in that
swimming pool you’re so proud of! And then you come to me and tell me
how to be happy!</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I think I’m gonna turn in. Dinner was good.
Really good.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: It’s pretty early. You tired?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah. It was kind of a rough week.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I hope your grandmother wasn’t too tough on
you?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No. She was fine. I’m glad you’re back.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Calvin?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: You are beautiful. And you are
unpredictable. But you’re so cautious. You’re determined, Beth. But you
know something? You’re not strong. And I don’t know if you’re really
giving. Beth is looking at him not knowing what this is about.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: I feel the way I’ve always felt about you.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: We would’ve been all right, if there hadn’t
been any …mess. But you can’t handle mess. You need everything neat and
…easy. I don’t know. Maybe you can’t love anybody. It was so much Buck.
And Buck died, it was as if you buried all your love with him, and I
don’t understand that. I just don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>156 continued: 156</strong>: CALVIN</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: The yard looks smaller without leaves.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Dad? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Your mother’s going away for a while.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Where? Why?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Back to Houston. Then I… I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Why? What… I know why. It’s me. Isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah, it is. It’s my fault.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Don’t do that! Don’t do that to yourself!
It’s nobody’s fault! Things happen in this world, people don’t always
have answers for them, you know.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: No, that’s right! You’re right! You ought to
do that more often.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Yeah, yeah, Haul my ass a little, you know.
Get after me. The way you used to for him.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Oh, he needed it. You didn’t. You were
always so hard on yourself, I never had the heart.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Oh, Dad. Don’t.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No, it’s the truth. I… I never worried about
you. I just wasn’t listening.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: Well, I wasn’t putting out many signals
then. I don’t think you could have done anything.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: No, no, no, I should …I should’ve got a
handle on it somehow.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: You know, I used to figure you had a handle
for everything. You knew it all.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: Well, don’t admire people too much. They’ll
disappoint you sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>conrad</strong>: I’m not disappointed. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>calvin</strong>: I love you too.</p>
