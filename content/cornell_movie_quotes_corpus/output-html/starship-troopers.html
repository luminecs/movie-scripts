<p><strong>young people</strong>: I’m doing my part… Me, too… Are you
?</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: Join the mobile infantery and save
the world ! Service guarantees citizen-ship. Would you like to know more
?</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: The Bugs send another meteor our way
!</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: But this time we are ready !
Planetary defenses are better than ever ! Would you like to know more
?</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: Klendathu, source of the bug meteor
attacks, orbits a twin star system whose brutal gravitational forces
produce an unlimited supply of meteorites…</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: To ensure the safety of our solar
system, Klendathu must be eliminated ! Would you like to know more ?</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: We break net now and take you live
to Klendathu where the invasion has begun !</p>
<p><strong>net correspondent</strong>: We ’ve just landes here on whar
cap troopres are calling “Big K” with the 6th Mobile Infantery division…
It ’s an ugly planet, a bug planet, a planet hostile to life as we
iGKKKKKK !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Com’on, let’s go ! ON THE BOUNCE</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh, God… Oh, God, help me… please help
me…</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: The end of another school year, and for me
no doubt another failure… Rico, pay attention !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Here in History and Moral Philosophy we’ve
explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the
world to the brink of chaos, and how the veterans took control and
imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since… You know
these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You. Why are only
citizens allowed to vote ?</p>
<p><strong>lanny</strong>: It’s a reward… what the Federation gives you
for doing Federal Service.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: No. Something given has no value ! Haven’t
I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching
credential…</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: When you vote, you’re exercising political
authority. You’re using force. And force, my friends, is violence, the
supreme authority from which all other authority derives.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Gee, we always thought you were the supreme
authority, Mr. Rasczak.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: In my classroom, you bet. Whether it’s
exerted by ten or ten billion, political authority is violence by
degree. The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield
it.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: My mother always says that violence never
solves anything.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of
Hiroshima would have to say about that. You.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: They probably wouldn’t say anything.
Hiroshima was destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Correct. Naked force has settled more
issues in history than any other factor. The contrary opinion ‘violence
never solves anything’ is wishful thinking at its worst.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: People who forget that always pay… They pay
with their lives and their freedom.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: You. Tell me the moral difference, if any,
between the citizen and the civilian ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: The difference lies in the field of civic
virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the
body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with
his life. The civilian does not.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: The exact words of the text. But do you
understand it ? Do you believe it ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Uh, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Of course you don’t. I doubt if any of you
here would recognize ‘civic virtue’ if it bit you in the ass.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Well, that’s it. Have a nice life.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: C’mon, let’s see if they’ve posted the math
final test yet.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Hey, Rico, we gonna take Tesla ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: How should I know ?</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: You’re captain of the team !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: First thing Fleet Academy looks at is your
math scores. Wish me luck !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Your turn…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Hold on… I wanna talk to Marco. His sister’s
at Fleet !</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You still haven’t kissed her yet ? Don’t
lie.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What’s the hurry ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Others are waiting.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Did you read her mind ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t have to… Some mating semaphore is pretty
hard to miss.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah, but I want Carmen.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You got it bad.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t forget about this afternoon. He’s always
late when he walks you home to fish for a kiss.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: She’s flying starships !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Who ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Marco’s sister. Can you imagine maneuvering
half a million tons through crwoded space lanes… You gotta have nerves
of steel ! Reflexes are critical</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I have good reflexes.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: C’mon Johnny, we’ll be late for Biology.</p>
<p><strong>biology teacher</strong>: For our final today, please
identify the mouthparts, the abdominal organs, and for extra credit,
locate the nerve cord and count the ganglia. You may begin.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Eeuch !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Aw, c’mon, it’s just a bug.</p>
<p><strong>biology teacher</strong>: Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to
think we are Nature’s finest achievement. I’m afraid it isn’t true. This
Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways. It has fewer moving
parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of
ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of society.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Better put your goggles on.</p>
<p><strong>biology teacher</strong>: Our galaxy is teaming with insect
life. We have identified over two billion species so far. Human, life,
it would seem, is the anomaly.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: But we ’re intelligent. Human minds have
invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel.</p>
<p><strong>biology teacher</strong>: True, we know of no insect society
that has produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a Cherynkov, but before
you let that go to your head, take the example of the Arachnids, a
highly organized, highly evolved insect society.</p>
<p><strong>biology teacher</strong>: They are relatively stupid by human
standards. Workers have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the
Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years of evolution,
Nature has provided the Arachnids with the biological means to hurl
their spore into space.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, if that’s the crop, that must be the
gastric caecal…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Excuse me…!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: 35% on the math final ! No one could be that
dumb with numbers.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Well, at least you didn’t lose your lunch
over a bug. How embarassing.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Who cares about bugs ? You can’t go anywhere
if you don’t know math.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Don’t be so sure. I like you even if you are
dumb with numbers.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Then how come you won’t hold hands with me
at school ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I don’t want everyone to see.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Why won’t you kiss me when we’re all alone
?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: How come that’s all you talk about anymore
?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s all I think about anymore.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: You can’t walk me home.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Why not ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I thought you were going to help Carl.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Carl can wait.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Johnny, my Dad’s home today.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What’s he got against me… I mean, I ’m a
teenager. You can’t be a citizen when you’re only a teenager !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: It’s not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich
they don’t need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad.
He’s a veteran.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, if your dad doesn’t like me, how come
we’re such good friends ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t think about it… go on instinct.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Ace of spades.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Statistically speaking you should’ve
accidentally guessed right by know.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: In addition to “psychic dolt” this test also
proves I’m unlucky ? Two of hearts.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Luck is not a factor. No one really knows why
some people are sensitive and some aren’t. Federal studies like this
might provide a clue.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I wouldn’t want to know what everyone was
thinking. Four of spades.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Cyrano, you big yellow turd !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He just wants attention. You don’t play with
him like you used to.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Go bug Mom, Cyrano.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: How do you make him do that ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I gave him the impression that there was a fly
crawling up my mom’s leg. He is going to go eat it.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: Get out ! Get out ! CARL…!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Carl, promise me you won’t ever do anything
like that to me.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Don’t be afraid. Can’t do humans… yet. C’mon
let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Ten of clubs. You still gonna sign up for
Starside R&amp;D ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Passport to the Universe. Who wouldn’t want
that ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’ve been thinking about applying for
Federal Service, too. Fleet, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Your father will never let you.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m eighteen. It’s my decision, I think I’d
make a pretty good pilot. I’ve good great reflexes. You need that for
maneuvering, you know.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through
stellar navigation. So what do you think your chances are ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Eight point… no, uh, seven…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: If you can’t do those numbers, you haven’t got
a chance.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: All I know is Carmen’s going to be a
citizen, and I don’t think it’ll work out for us if I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Love… how excruciatingly pathetic. Now try and
pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Queen of hearts.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, what do you know about that !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Tesla’s tough. They tumble good and they hit
HARD.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We tumble good, too.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Kick three, fade left. On two.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Time’s running out.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: A lot can happen in three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Hut… hut !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Are you alright ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: I’m getting better.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: So what are you doing later ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Everyone is going to the dance. Aren’t you
?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: I don’t know. It’s my last night as
acivilian. I ship out for Tereshkova tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: You’re going to the Academy ? That’s where I
want to go. I’d love to talk to you abou that.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: I’m all ears.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Don’t you have to finish the game ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Don’t get any ideas. She’s my girl.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: You can never be sure.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Flip six, three hole. Rico ? Hey !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: You were drifting. Flip six, three hole. On
one, got it ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Just throw me the ball, Diz.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Hut !</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Who said you could grow up so fast ? Last
time I checked you were only five years old. You had such a bright
little face…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Aw, don’t get mushy.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: This came for you today. I presume on your
request.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: A lot of my friends are doing Federal
Service…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: You aren’t thinking of applying…?</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Have you lost you lost your mind ? I’d
rather take ten lashes in Public Square than see you ruin your life.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s aterm of service, not a career. I just
want to get out on my own and see the Galaxy for a couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Johnny, people get hurt… people get killed
in the Federal Service. If something happened to you I don’t know what I
would do…</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Who gave you this idea ? It’s that teacher.
What’s his name ? You know the one I mean.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Mr. Rasczak.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Rasczak… Silly name. There ought to be a law
against using a school as a recruiting station !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No, Mr. Rasczak doesn’t do that at all. He
sorta discourages you really.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Good, because you’re going to Harvard, and
that’s the end of it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m eighteen. It’s my decision.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Oh, is that how it is ?</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Wait you two. Dad and I have a surprise for
you that will settle this. Can you guess what it is ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Uh, no.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: A trip to the Outer Rings. Whad’ya think of
that ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Wow ! Santori and Zegema Beach, I’ve always
wanted to go there.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Good good, then it’s all settled.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: A year at Harvard and you’ll see this
“Federal Service” is just menial training for inferior people so they
can call themselves “citizens” and take airs for the rest of their
lives.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Wait a minute ! Carl is doing his Federal
and he isn’t inferior. He’s the smartest kid at school !</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Sorry. Carl’s a fine boy…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t know what they teach at Harvard, but
I think I’m pretty good enough the way I am !</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Johnny, please. Calm yourself.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, that’s what you’re saying ! You’re
saying that I’m not good enough the way I am now !</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Why did you go and do that ? He was all
ready to go Zegema Beach !</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: Teenagers !</p>
<p><strong>band leader</strong>: Alright, everybody, this is the last
dance, so let’s turn down the lights and make it a slow one.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Hey, Rico, wanna dance ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Actually, Diz, I promised Carmen…</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Too bad for her if she’s not around.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: You know, it’s sad… Most of us probably won’t
see each other again after tonight.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You still gonna play for Brazil ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Looks like, unless Tokyo lets me start.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, anyone who gets you is lucky.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: How come we never got together ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Can’t we just be friends, Diz ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Uh, look, Diz…</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Guess you gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You’re the best.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Isn’t it great to be in love ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: How do I know if this is love ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It wouldn’t be so romantic if we
weren’t…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Outa the way you two !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Romance is just a vestigial biological
response to procreation…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Aw, you’re in love with me… You just dont
know it yet.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Wait, I want to talk to Mr. Rasczak.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I’ll meet you outside.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Mister Rasczak ?</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: What is it, Rico ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I just wanted to say thanks ’cause History
and Moral Philosophy was the best class I had this year.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Well, it’s not really my job to please.
Hope you learned something.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I wanna join up, Mr. Rasczak. I think I have
what it take to be a citizen.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Good for you. Go find out.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, my parents are against it, and I know
it’s my choice, but I was wondering… What would you do if you were me
?</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Figuring things out for yourself is the
only freedom anyone really has. Use that freedom. Make your own choice,
Rico.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Johnny, this is Zander.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Yeah, we know each other from the game. No
hard feeling, eh, chum ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: None at all… We won.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Good luck at the academy.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: He just got accepted to the Fleet Academy.
Isn’t that great ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah, sure, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: No, I mean if he can get in, maybe I have a
chance.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What are you talking about ? We both know
you’re gonna be a pilot.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Zander is going for pilot, too.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You two have so much in common.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Johnny Rico, you’re jealous !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I can’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: He’s nothing like you.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t even know if you’re my girl.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Are you the boy for me ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m gonna do it, Carmen. I’m gonna sign up
for Federal Service.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Oh, Johnny…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Everyone’s looking… we shouldn’t…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Who cares ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: You’re right. Let’s never stop…</p>
<p><strong>policeman</strong>: Hey, you, there’s a place for that !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I love you, Carmen.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>carmen’s dad</strong>: Carmen, it’s late. Get inside.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Sorry, Dad. See you, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>carmen’s dad</strong>: I don’t want you around Carmen
anymore. Get me ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Maybe Carmen’s gonna make her own decisions
from now on, Mr. Ibanez.</p>
<p><strong>carmen’s dad</strong>: Carmen’s gonna be a citizen. She don’t
need you and your rich family. The Federation’ll give her everything she
needs.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Dad, leave him alone…</p>
<p><strong>recruiting sergeant</strong>: Fresh meat for the grinder, eh
?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: That’s us. Where do we sign ?</p>
<p><strong>recruiting sergeant</strong>: Here and here and here.</p>
<p><strong>recruiting sergeant</strong>: Welcome to the adventure of
Federal Service. Follow the blue line.</p>
<p><strong>colonel</strong>: There is no guarantee of service. We don’t
need all of you. It costs a great deal to train human beings for useful
tasks. Many jobs are hazardous to your health. If you are chosen and do
not wish to serve you may resign at anytime simply by completing form
1240/A. Thank you for exercising you constitutonal rights.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: They took my sister, they’ll take anybody.</p>
<p><strong>don</strong>: Oh, this is the part that hurts !</p>
<p><strong>psych officer</strong>: No talking please. I’m going to ask
you some questions. Please answer all questions truthfully. We’ll know
if you don’t. Birthplace ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Here in Buenos Aires.</p>
<p><strong>psych officer</strong>: Are your parents currently citizens
?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>psych officer</strong>: Which do you think is more important,
courage or confidence ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Courage, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>psych officer</strong>: Please complete this sentence. I want
to be citizen because…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I want to be a citizen because… well,
because of my girl, sir.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: I’m happy to tell you that you’ve been
accepted for Federal Service.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Wow, that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Looks like you’re quite an athlete. Boy, look
at those reaction stats.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: My job is to dertermine what you’re best
suited for.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I want to be a pilot, sir.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: Sorry, son, no way. Your school records say
you don’t have the math skills.</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: That rules out the scientific and engineering
applications, and I’m afraid we reserve non-military options for
candidates who are frankly less able-bodied than you are, son…</p>
<p><strong>major</strong>: It looks like the only thing you’re good for
is cannon fodder. I’m putting you down for the Mobile Infantery.</p>
<p><strong>johnny et al</strong>: …of my own free will, without promise,
coercion, or inducement, after having been duly advised and warned of
the meaning and consequence of this oath, do now enroll in the Federal
Service of the Terran Federation for not less than two years and as much
longer as may be required by the needs of the Service…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I wonder where Carl is. You don’t
suppose…?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Naw, I made it, Carl made it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He was in the group with me. I guess he
didn’t…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Shhh ! Don’t make him feel worse.</p>
<p><strong>recruiting sergeant</strong>: They put me out front to
discourage the weak-hearted, but at the end of the day I go home. How’d
you kids do ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I’m gonna go for pilot.</p>
<p><strong>recruiting sergeant</strong>: Good for you. We need every
pilot we can get.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Hey, Carl, what’s wrong ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Did you get Starside R&amp;D ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I don’t believe it !</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I got Games &amp; Theory.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Games &amp; Theory ? That’s Military
Intelligence… Oh, Carl !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Whoa ! Way to go, boy-yo !</p>
<p><strong>recruiting sergeant</strong>: Next time we meet, I’ll
probably have to salute you. What about you, son ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Infantery, sir.</p>
<p><strong>recruiting sergeant</strong>: Well, good for you. The Mobile
Infantery made me the man I am today.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Let’s all make a vow. Let’s swear we’ll
always be friends no matter what.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’ll go for that.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Well, we’re gonna be millions of light years
away from each other, and chances are we’ll never see each other again,
but sure…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I can’t wait to tell my Dad I’m in. He’s
gonna be so happy !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: My father’s probably gonna kill me.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You’ll resign, and that’s all there is to
it. It might look bad, but if that’s the worst you suffer…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I won’t quit !</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: I’m telling you, you will ! You’re not going
back. You’re going to go on vacation !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m not going on vacation ! I want to be
acitizen ! It’s my decision. I made it.</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: You walk out that door, you’re cut off,
young man… You understand me ? Alright, THAT’S IT, YOU’RE…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Johnny, why won’t you change your mind ?
Does citizenship mean so much to you ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, yeah, sure…</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: I hope so. I hope you don’t ruin your life
over some silly little girl who wants to look handsome in a uniform.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Don’t talk about my girl that way.</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: Outbound group 1380, Ursa Minor and Tyko, now
transporting at bank 17…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You’re late.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: My Dad had to help me pack. Suddenly he’s
afraid he’s never gonna see me again or something. It was sweet, but it
took forever. Anyway, I guess I’m ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Me, too. I’m wearing everything I own.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Poor boy. I’m sorry your parents were so
mad.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Who cares ! The Federation’ll give me
everything I need for the next two years, right ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: You talk to Carl ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He left this morning. He couldn’t say
where.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: It’s exciting, but it’s scary, too isn’t it.
Going someplace new where you don’t know anyone.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m gonna miss you.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I’ll miss you, too, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: Outbound group 948A, Tereshkova, all sections,
transporting at bank 5.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Oh, that’s me.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Com’on, just say it. Try it on for size.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Alright, I love you.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Do you mean it ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I said it. Isn’t that enough ? Don’t forget
to write !</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: From all over the known Galaxy,
prospectice citizens work together to make a better tomorrow ! Would you
like to know more ?</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: A murderer was captured and tried
today. Sentence: DEATH. Tonight at six, all net, all channels. Would you
like to know more ?</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: If you think you are psychic, maybe
you are. Harness your unique abilities and take advantage of the many
Federal benefits available for psychic citizens. Would you like to know
more ?</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: Disregarding Federal warnings,
Mormon extremists established Port Joe Smith, a settlement of 300 on
Tango Urilla, a system just inside the Arachnid Quarantine Zone.</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: Too late they realized tha Tango
Urilla had already been chosen by other colonists – Arachnids !</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: The council asks future colonists to
obey all official Federal warnings. Would you like to know more ?</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: The problem with you is that none of you are
good enough the way you are.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: I am your senior drill instructor, Career
Sergeant Zim.</p>
<p><strong>to think this had to happen to</strong>: ME ! What a bunch of
apes. No, strike that. You don’t rate that good…you sunken-chested,
slack-bellied, drooling refugees from apron strings ! In my whole life
I’ve never seen such a disgraceful huddle of momma’s spoiled little
darlings ! Suck in those guts ! You there, EYES FRONT !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Do you think I’m funny ? Do I make you laugh ?
Do you think I’m a comedian ?</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: Sorry…!</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: The first and last words out of your stinking
holes will be “sir”. Do you get me ?</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: Sir, sorry…sir.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: See the armory ? Run around it !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: RUN, I SAID. Bronski, keep pace !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: You are now all brothers and sisters in the
same family, my family, the Mobile Infantery. I will be your mother. I
will be your father. If you do not please me I will throw you out of my
family because I hate all slackers and negative hackers. Do you get me
?</p>
<p><strong>johnny et al</strong>: Sir, yes, sir !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Anytime you think I’m being to tough, anytime
you think I’m being unfair… QUIT ! Grab your gear and take a stroll down
“Washout Lane”. Get me ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny et al</strong>: Sir, yes, sir !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: I wonder if there’s a handful of guts in the
whole bunch. Who thinks they’ve got what it takes to knock me down ?</p>
<p><strong>breckinridge</strong>: Sir, I guess maybe I do, sir.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: You alright, Breckinridge ?</p>
<p><strong>breckinridge</strong>: Sir, yes, sir. It’s my arm. I think
it’s broken, sir.</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: Clean break… Doc’ll have him back on active
duty by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Good. Who’s next ?</p>
<p><strong>djana’d</strong>: Lookit the little guy go !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He’s good alright.</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I’ll bet he makes squad leader.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: He’ll have to get past me.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Some of you may not �make it.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: You might think I am unfair.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Is that all you got ? You hit like kitten,
Smith ! This is a punch.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: You will not like me.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: But if you survive you will thank me because
you will be born again hard. You will be a new person. You will be a Cap
Trooper. And then, MAYBE, you’ll be good enough…</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: …to serve in my family.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Sir, I don’t understands who needs a knife in a
nuke fight anyway… All you gotta do is push a button, sir !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Put your hand on the post, private.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: The enemy cannot push a button if you disable
his hand. MEDIC !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Sir, recruit Flores, reporting for duty ,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: I see you specifically requested transfer from
Fort Cronkite to this training group…</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Sir, I heard it was the best, sir !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: It is the best… BUT WHAT MAKES YOU</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: I’d like to disable Zim…!</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Improper Attitude ! They’ll kick you out
for talking like that…</p>
<p><strong>djana’d</strong>: They can kick you out for anything.
Improper Conduct, Unsatisfactory Performance…</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: Off you go down Washout Lane, bye-bye
!</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Aw, you either got what it takes or you
don’t.</p>
<p><strong>djana’d</strong>: C’mon Ace, wait your turn !</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: At ease, soldier. It’s all the same muck.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Better get in line like everyone else,
Ace.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: You got some guts for a rich kid. I guess you
and me could be buddies.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What an honor…</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Hey, don’t laugh. Everyone oughta have a friend
like me !</p>
<p><strong>breckinridge</strong>: Come on, Ace, back off the line ! Bacl
off the line !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Hey, amigo, come chow with me.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No thanks, Diz.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: What’s your malfunction, Rico ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You are. I joined up to get out on my own.
And you had to tag along.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: What ? You think I joined the Mobile
Infantery because of you ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You saying you didn’t ?</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: What makes you think… you’ll make… squad
leader, Rico ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Something… I’ve got…you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: You rich kids… are all the same !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It isn’t about rich… It’s about who’s
best…!</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Coming through !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: C’mon, move it, you apes !</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: We all have one thing in common. We
were all stupid enough to sign up for Mobile Infanterie. What’s your
excuse, Breckinridge ?</p>
<p><strong>breckinridge</strong>: Well, my family is all farmers. I hate
farming. Mobile Infantery’s pure picnic by comparison.</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: So the grow ’em big and dumb on the
farm planet, eh ? Djana’d ?</p>
<p><strong>djana’d</strong>: I’m going in for politics. You gotta be a
citizen for that. So here I am.</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: C’mon, keep it going… Katrina !</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: I wanna be a mom. It’s easier to get a
licence if you’ve served.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: I’m going career… officer’s training. That’s
why I wanna be squad leader. They look for that.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Wanting it doesn’t make you the best one for
the job.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Oh, yeah ? I don’t see anyone else here with
the chops to lead.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, maybe you better look again.</p>
<p><strong>shujumi</strong>: Federation’s gonna give me a scholarship
when my hitch is up. I wanna be a neurologist, study brain chemisty and
associated stimulus…</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: Your turn, Rico !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Aw, who asked you to be so nosey ?</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: Me, I got plans to be writer, and a
writer’s got a right to be nosey. Flores, you know Rico from Buenos
Aires… What’s his story ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Well, some say he turned his back on the
family fortune to be a citizen, others say he did it for a girl… missed
a spot there, bucko… which is funny because Johnny says I joined up to
be with him, but why would I do that ? He doesn’t even like me.</p>
<p><strong>breckinridge</strong>: Don’t look that way to me.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I know it’s not much, but it’s home. Over
there’s my bunk where I dream about you every night…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey, do you mind ?</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Hey, what’s going on ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: I bet it’s that girl I was talking about… Her
name’s Carmen, I think.</p>
<p><strong>ace and the others</strong>: Carmen ! Ooh la la, Carmencita
!</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Hi, Carmen !</p>
<p><strong>ace and the others</strong>: Hey, where you going ? Come
back…! He’s getting awy… Grab him…!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Boot’s pretty tough, and sometimes I think I
won’t make it, but then I imagine you’re watching me, and that gives me
someting… I try harder. Thanks to you, I think I might have a shot at
squad leader.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Uh-oh, I gotta pack it in. I hope you’re
having fun, hope you’re careful. No training accidents for you, eh ? I
want to kiss you so badly. I want to feel you next to me, I-</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: I love you truly, so truly, dear…!</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Our love will grow, dear, year by year…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Bye ! Write me ! I’m gonna kill you guys
!</p>
<p><strong>bald cadet</strong>: Orbit in five, Ibanez ! First one there
gets to fly !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Looking it down !</p>
<p><strong>late cadet</strong>: Oh no, not Ibanez again, she’s crazy
!</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: On my mark, in three, two, one…</p>
<p><strong>bald cadet</strong>: Geez, I thought I liked to fly fast
!</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: This is nothing. Today, I get to fly that
!</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Pilot Trainee Ibanez reporting for duty,
ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Take the number one chair, Ibanez. Follow
all instructions of you supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Yes, ma’am !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Hey ! What are you doing here ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: I’m the guy who’s gonna teach you to fly
this crate.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Assistant insructor… You must be some kind
of a hot stick. Should I call you “sir” ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Only when I give you an order.</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Prepare for departure.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: It’s amazing, us running into each other
like this. Maybe it’s fate.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Maybe not. I heard about this crazy girl
coming through the academy, solid math, a little wild on the stick, but
a natural. When it turned out it was you, I made sure we’d run into each
other…</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Alright, take her out, Ibanez.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Yes, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: In simulation, my supervisors could never
keep up.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: This isn’t simulation anymore. Take’er out
easy, cadet.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Oh, yes, sir. Vector ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Twenty-five by five, roll seven. And don’t
exceed port speed.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Or…?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: They revoke our flight status.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Oh, I see… teamwork.</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Steady as she goes, number one. Prepare
for warp. Number two, design for Jupiter orbit.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Yes, ma’am. Star drive in three… two…
one…</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: The object of this exercise is to capture your
enemy’s flag before your enemy captures yours.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: These weapons have been modified for this
exercise. If your enemy hits you, your suit will fail. You will be
unable to move. You will be as good as dead.</p>
<p><strong>djana’d</strong>: It’s right over the next ridge… Only two
guards.</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: You are now prisoners of the Blue
Team. Tell us your plans or die !</p>
<p><strong>djana’d</strong>: Oh no ! Name, rank, and mind your own
business is all you get from me !</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: I’m going in ! Let’s go !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Man, they’re defended… no way in.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Flip six, three hole.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: High school… remember ? Run a flip six, three
hole play, and you might score…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Cover me.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Thanks, pal.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Kid’s got some moves…</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Smith, GO ! McIntire, GO ! Flores, GO ! Rico,
I’m making you sqaud leader !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sir, thank you, sir !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Don’t stand there dumb… GO !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: YEEEE-Haaaaaaaaaaaaa…!</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: Look at him. Do you think anyone has
ever been so pleased with himself ?</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Zim hadda choose someone to be his brown nose,
I guess.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I just want you guys to know that I’ll never
do anything that I haven’t asked you to do first.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Couldn’t’ve done it without you, Diz.
Friends ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Yeah, sure… friends.</p>
<p><strong>bronski</strong>: Levy… Shujumi… Rico.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Bet it’s from my girl.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Hi, Johnny, I would’ve written sooner, but
they’ve really got us going every moment here.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Yeow, Rico, you don’t deserve that !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Shhhh…!</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I’m glad you’re doing so well. If they
haven’t made you squad leader by now, I’m sure you will.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: All it takes is the love of a good
woman…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Look at that. Isn’t it beautiful ? I had to
show you. It’s great to be out here on my own. I’m just not some little
girl from Buenos Aires anymore. I’m gonna be a starship pilot, and I’m
gonna see the universe… And that’s also the problem because I don’t
really want to get married, Johnny. I don’t want to have kids. I want a
command, a ship of my own, and you know, I don’t think that’s gonna
leave a lot of room for you and me.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I know that’s not what you wanted to hear…
but I have to follow my heart. I’m sorry. I’m afraid you’ll hate me, and
I couldn’t stand that. Write me, alright ? Write me, so I’ll know that
we’ll always be friends.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Funny how they always want to be your friends
after they kick your guts out.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s what I deserve.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Whad’ya talkin about ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I joined up for her. I wouldn’t even be here
if it wasn’t for her. I’m a fool.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: You made squad leader on your own, and, hey,
you still got me to kick around.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Thanks, Ace.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: With the Marauder’s visual capabilities, all
you have to do is look at something to hit it, so you will exercise
EXTREME CARE on my firing line. Do you get me ?</p>
<p><strong>recruits</strong>: Sir, yes, sir !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: The live firing combat range is the closest
simulation of actual combat we can provide. If you do not hit your
target, it will shoot you…</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: The Marauder power suit will prevent serious
injury, but if you are hit, you will be non-operational and your team
score will suffer accordingly. Rico, has each member of your squad
completed a weapons safety check ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sir, yes, sir !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Perfect score for this exercise is 300. B
company came through last week with 285. I expect you to do better.</p>
<p><strong>djana’d</strong>: You’re in my line of fire, Breckinridge</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Alright, no more screw ups. Ace takes point.
Diz, you and Kitten Smith cover the flanks. Djana’d, you’re rear guard.
Move out.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What’s the problem ?</p>
<p><strong>breckinridge</strong>: Dunno. Display’s fritzed.</p>
<p><strong>djana’d</strong>: Lose another rifle, we’re gonna mess up our
score…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>djana’d</strong>: How come when something goes wrong, it’s
always you, Breckinridge ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh, God… uh… MEDIC !</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Rico, you are relieved of squad command. Levy,
McIntire you will escort private Rico to the C.O.’s Office.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Rico, did you give the recruit permission to
remove his helmet ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sir, yes, sir. Breckinridge reported a
helmet malfunction, and I asked him to show it to me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Are you rated to repair a Marauder power suit,
Rico ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sir, no, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Then why did you order your man to remove his
helmet during a live fire exercise ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sir, I needed everyone in my squad
operational, sir… I… I wanted to win, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o:</strong>: You disobeyed safety regulation 21-404. You
may, of course, demand trial by court martial.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sir, no, sir !</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Do you freely admit to the charges made
against you ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sir… I guess I do, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Sergeant, we’ve lost two recruits over this
incident already… is there any possibility of salvaging this man ?</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Alright. We’ll try administrative punishment.
Until then you are confined to your quarters, Rico.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Alright, let’s go, Rico.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: For incompetence of command, for failure to
abide by safety regulations in a live fire exercise, for negligence
which contributed to the death of a teammate…</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Bite on this. It helps. I know.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: … recruit trainee John Rico is sentenced to
administrative punishment. Ten lashes.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: You may carry out the sentence.</p>
<p><strong>bronski</strong>: One.</p>
<p><strong>bronski</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>bronski</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>bronski</strong>: Four.</p>
<p><strong>bronski</strong>: Five.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Thanks. You read my mind. Third watch always
seems to last forever.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Oh, I don’t know… Depends on who you are
spending it with.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Profile’s wrong… there.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: No, I replotted the course. It’s more
efficient this way.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Three weeks aboard a starship and you know
it all, huh ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Hey, check it.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: You know I was talking to Captain, Deladier,
and she said…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Don’t change the subject. Am I right ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Well, whad’ya know…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Don’t mess with the boss. So what’d the
captain say ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: She got a command… and she thinks we oughta
team up officially and crew for her. She thinks we’re good together.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: You and me, huh ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: I have a feeling about us. We’re good
together, way ahead of the curve in every department. I seem to be able

<p><strong>zander</strong>: Sweet Jesus…!</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Where’d it come from ?</p>

<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’ve made a mess of things. I’ve been so

<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Well, see ya.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: You take the stroll down Washout Lane, you’re
only proving one thing, Johnny.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What’s that, Diz ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: That you don’t have what it takes to be
acitizen !</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Now you, Sergeant.</p>

private. You get me ?</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Yes, sir, I get you.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: What can I do for you, Rico ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sir, I wish to reconsider my request to drop
out, sir.</p>
<p><strong>c.o.</strong>: Sorry, son. I can’t do it. You signed the
1240/A. It would be illegal.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sir, i know it was wrong. I didn’t learn
from one mistake and I made another, sir. Sir, my family… my whole
family was in Buenos Aires, sir.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Is that your signature, Rico ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sir, yes it is, sir.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Doesn’t look like it to me.</p>
<p><strong>zim</strong>: Get outa here, private.</p>

you ? The war effort needs your effort at work, at home, in your
community. Would you like to know more ?</p>
<p><strong>sky marshall dienes</strong>: We are a generation commanded

and the talk says tomorrow !</p>
<p><strong>net correspondent</strong>: Here’s a bunch of M.I. kids who
look like they eat bugs for lunch !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Yum, yum yum …!</p>
<p><strong>net correspondent</strong>: So you’re not to worried about
fighting the Arachnids…?</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Hey, shoot a nuke down a bug hole, lotta dead
bugs, am I right ?</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: I just hope it’s not over before we
get in it !</p>
<p><strong>net correspondent</strong>: Some say the bugs were provoked
by human attempts to colonize within the AQZ, that a “live and let live”
policy is preferable to war with the bugs…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah, well, I’m from Buenos Aires, and I say
kill’em all !</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: That guy’s been in it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: How can you tell ?</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: The eyes. He’s got the 1000 meters
stare.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Great scars.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: I like the jewelry. Hey, amigo, where can I
get an earring like yours ?</p>
<p><strong>veteran</strong>: Port Joe Smith, Outer Rings, Dantana… Every
time I come back from a drop, my gunny gives me a bone. I got three now.
You don’t see a lot of guys with three.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Waht’s it like… combat ?</p>
<p><strong>veteran</strong>: I guess it’s not so bad. I mean as long as
you don’t get any on you.</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: Get any what on you ?</p>
<p><strong>veteran</strong>: Oh, you’ll know when it happens. See you on
the bounce.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: I say we all go to the laser parlor and get cut

<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What happened to your hair ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: What do you think ? Everyone did it when we
got our wings. You don’t like it, do you ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s alright, I guess. You hear from anyone
made it out of B.A. alive ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: It’s funny. Sometimes I forget. Then it hits
me, and I can’t stop crying.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I try just to be happy I’m still alive.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: You don’t look very happy to see me.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Should I be ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Johnny… Life is so different from the way it
was. One day you’ll see what I did was best for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Everything coposetic, Lieutenant ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Zander, you remember Johnny ? Zander and I
are a flight team now.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Best in the Fleet !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I get it. This is the part that’s best for
both of us. Don’t do me anymore favors, eh ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Johnny, wait…</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Forget it, Carmen. The Mobile Infantery does
a thankless, dirty job, so they naturally tend to be short-tempered,
thoughtless and rude.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You got something to say about the Mobile
Infantery ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: You heard me. Wanna make something out of
it, private ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Not with an officer, no, sir. The M.I.
doesn’t mint stupid cap troopers.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Let’s disregaed rank… Everybody hear that ?
Rank is not an issue here.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Zander, please… Let’s go !</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: It’s alright. What’s he gonna do ?</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Whoa, easy there, buddy… Nice punch.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: What’s wrong with you ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey, it’s just a vestigal response to
procreation… bitch.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Forget it, Johnny. Cap Troopers and Fleet
weren’t meant to mix !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It hurts…!</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: No, this hurts.</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: Well, here’s to it ! We’re gonna
fightn, and we’re gonna win !</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Mobile Infantery rules !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Death to all bugs !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Don’t get any on you !</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Officer on deck !</p>
<p><strong>lt. willy</strong>: At ease. Alright… we got hot poop
straight from the top: Willy’s Wildcats is in with the first wave. Means
more bugs for us to kill…</p>
<p><strong>lt. willy</strong>: Now if you follow orders and remember
your training, I guarantee you’ll make it back alive. Any questions
?</p>
<p><strong>lt. willy</strong>: Alright… next we got a little last minute
briefing from Military Intelli-gence I think you’re gonna like…</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: Everyday Federal scientists are
looking for new ways to kill bugs and you can help…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: To defeat the enemy, we must know the enemy.
Take for instance your basic Arachnid warrior. Minimal IQ, armored,
completely lethal. You can blow a limb off…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: … and it’s still 86% combat effec-tive. But
here’s a tip: Aim for the nerve stem and put it down for good.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Now while you are out killing bugs, we want
you to be our eyes and ears. The bugs use some kind of plasma burst to
divert meteors and aim them toward Earth. We need to know how they do
this. If you encounter any plasma, report it immediately to your
superior. Good luck and good hunting !</p>
<p><strong>p.a.</strong>: This is the Captain speaking. All personnel
prepare for drop.We are at D minus three and counting.</p>
<p><strong>lt. willy</strong>: Move out !</p>
<p><strong>lt. willy</strong>: Smash the entire area, kill anything that
has more’n a couple legs , and don’t any of you loafers come back aboard
with unexpended bombs. Get me ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny et al</strong>: Yes, sir !</p>
<p><strong>fire control</strong>: Five seconds…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Plasma, ma’am… from the planet.</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Bug Batteries… According to Military
Intelligence, it’ll be random and light. Drop status ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Drop is 35% complete, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Steady as she goes, Number 1.</p>
<p><strong>guidance computer</strong>: …surface in twenty-fivr seconds
…LZ has been identified …beacon is in place…</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: This isn’t random or light. Someone made
amistake…!</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: That’s it, we’re empty ma’am !</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Someone made a big goddam mistake ! Get us
out of here, Number 1 !</p>
<p><strong>guidance computer</strong>: …surface in fifteen seconds…
deploying chute now…</p>
<p><strong>guidance computer</strong>: …surface in five… four …
three…</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant willy</strong>: Up there on the ridge ! We’ll nuke
those bug positions from theAAAAAAAA !</p>

<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Don’t waste your ammon on the workers !</p>
<p><strong>katrina</strong>: Let’s get out of here !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Look out !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: C’mon, Katrina was right. We gotta get out
of here !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: It’s a general retreat ! The boats are
coming down.</p>
<p><strong>net correspondent</strong>: We’ve just landed here on what
cap troopers are calling the “Big K” with the 6th Mobile Infantery
Division. It’s an ugly planet, a bug planet, a planet hostile to life as
we kow iGKKKKK !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: C’mon, let’s go ! ON THE BOUNCE !</p>
<p><strong>kitten smith</strong>: I can see the beacon…!</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Retrieval !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Johnny ! JOHNNY ! WHERE ARE YOU ? JOHNNY !
Johnny…!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Medic… MEDIC…!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Oh, God… Oh, God, help me… please help
me…!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Take my hand !</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: Crsisis for Humankind ! Fleet
official admit they underestimated the Arachnid’s defensive capability.

<p><strong>official voice</strong>: Accepting responsibility for
Klendathu, Sky Marshall Dienes resigns. His successor, Sky Marshall
Tahat Meru, outlines her new strategy.</p>
<p><strong>sky marshall meru</strong>: Until we understand the bug

Klendathu.</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: To explain the intelligent military
actions of the Arachnids, Federal Scientists postulate the existence of
a leadership caste…BRAIN BUGS !</p>
<p><strong>official voice</strong>: Families oof those who have died or
become incapacitated by Federal Service are entitled to benefits ! If

<p><strong>ticonderoga c&amp;c</strong>: Affirmative, Rodger Young…one
zero zero niner five two… welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: You know, we’re lucky to be alive.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Give me hand, willya ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: I was thinking. Maybe we should get married,
Carmen.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: You weren’t thinking…you were dreaming !</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: If we’re gonna be a team, why not be a real
team ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: There’s a war on. I want a command, I want
my own ship, you do, too…</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: So ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: So who’s got time to get married ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Fleet encourages marriages among flight
officers. You’d probably get a promotion out of it.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Funny…</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: I’m not kidding. Marriage is -</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: No, funny there’s almost no wounded at
all.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Hey, bugs don’t take prisoners.</p>

<p><strong>carmen</strong>: No, don’t you see ? No one can wait for
anything anymore… You’re right… We should get married…</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Two more days.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Dizzy says you two knew this Rasczak character
in Buenos Aires…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He was our teacher… He was great.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Yeah, well, I hear he’s a real nutbuster.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: The Roughnecks killed more bugs than any
other outfit in 2nd Brigade… Only took 15% casualties on Big K.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Seeing as how we’re about all that’s left of
1st Brigade, you’d have to call that an improvement. You top kick ?</p>
<p><strong>sugar watkins</strong>: Are you kidding ? They always get
killed. You want the job ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I wouldn’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: I would. Nice earring.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Where you been besides Big K ?</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Outer rings. Zegema Beach.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I always wanted to go to Zegema Beach.</p>
<p><strong>sugar watkins</strong>: Good luck. It’s not there
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Is your Lieutenant as bad as they say ?</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: No one talks about the Lieutenant that way.
He saved my life !</p>
<p><strong>sugar watkins</strong>: Mine, too.</p>
<p><strong>other roughnecks</strong>: Same for me… me, too…</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Sounds like he is quite a guy.</p>
<p><strong>gillespie</strong>: Attention !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: This is for you new people. I only have two
rules. Rule one, everyone fights. Rule two, no one quits. If you don’t
do your job, I’ll kill you myself. Do you get me ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny, dizzy and ace</strong>: We get you, sir !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Get rid of the jewelry. I hate it. Welcome
to the Roughnecks.</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Rasczak’s Roughnecks !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Alright. There’s a new Sky Marshall and a
new plan. We’re gonna clean out the systems outlying Klendathu one
planet at a time. Tomorrow we hit Tango Urilla. After Fleet glasses the
planet, M.I. mops up.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Spread out, teams of three. When you locate
a bug hole, secure it, gas it, and close it.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: There.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Fire in the hole !</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: You new guys over there… WE could use some
help…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Looks like you’ve got a little bug problem,
ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>birdie</strong>: Stow it, trooper. Give it verything you’ve
got !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Sugar, in for pick up !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Gas that hole and close it !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Where’d you learn to do that, soldier ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Uni High Tigers, sir. Don’t you remember ? I
was captain of the team.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: I’m not interested in nostalgia, Rico, I
need a corporal. You’re it until you’re dead or I find someone
better.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Don’t worry, Birdie, your next arm comes
with a factory guarantee !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Way to go, amigo !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m gonna need a squad leader.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: No way. Big K taught me I ain’t executive
material.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What about it, Diz ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Looks like I’m your girl, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Saddle up, Roughnecks. That’s our trash
!</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What kind of stinkin’ bug is that ?</p>
<p><strong>sugar watkins</strong>: You never seen how they do it before
?</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Agghh ! It’s making me sick…!</p>
<p><strong>sugar watkins</strong>: It’s gonna pop !</p>
<p><strong>gillespie</strong>: Sir, look !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: We must be right over the colony. Let’s get
some air support, eh ?</p>
<p><strong>gillespie</strong>: Yes, sir ! Fleet, this is Roughneck
patrol, over …?</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Corporal, I want pulse cannons there and
there ! Rifle teams, spread out along the ridge ! Sugar, bring up that
flame thrower !</p>
<p><strong>gillespie</strong>: Fleet’s pulling the battle group back to
safe distance… They’d like us to knock out those batteries, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: They’d rather spend our lives than risk
their ships. Who’s got the nuke ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: That’d be me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Heat it up.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Roughnecks, you may fire at will.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: I’m hot, sir !</p>
<p><strong>gillespie</strong>: Now comes the part I hate the most.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What’s that ?</p>
<p><strong>gillespie</strong>: We go down into the colony and make sure
all the queens are dead.</p>
<p><strong>sugar watkins</strong>: You knew the Lieutenant before the
war… What was he like ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: He was a teacher , kind of a know it all…
Always had this little smile.</p>
<p><strong>sugar watkins</strong>: Geez, I don’t think I’ve ever seen
him smile.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Must fill your bottle up real quick when
your wife and kids get smeared.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: All dead except one, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Kill the bitch.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Tango Urilla is now bug free. Means the
Roughnecks have killed a helluva lotta bugs…!</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: I expect the best, but I give the best.
Habve some fun. That’s an order !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: C’mon…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Nah, I don’t do that anymore…</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: You used to dance…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I said no. Want me to pull rank ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Well, excuse me, sir…</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Yopu asked me some advice once, Rico. Want
some now ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yes, sir…</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Never pass up a good thing, eh ?</p>
<p><strong>gillespie</strong>: Lieutenant, Brigade’s on the com…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hey, Diz…</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: What ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: May I have the honor ?</p>
<p><strong>intelligence officer</strong>: At 0821 we received a distress
call from Planet P, priority code, requesting reinforcement…</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: I thought 4th brigade cleaned out P.</p>
<p><strong>intelligence officer</strong>: Owen reported the eradication
of a low generation colony a month ago. That’s why MICOM wants onsite
assessment.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Sounds more like some idiot at Military
Intelligence Command wants to get me and my cap troopers killed…</p>
<p><strong>intelligence officer</strong>: Take your group down to P and
have a look see. Leave the thinking to us, Lieutenant. That’s not your
job.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: My job is to protect the lives of my
soldiers so they can kill bugs, Major, and if you’re walking me into a
trap-</p>
<p><strong>intelligence officer</strong>: Bugs don’t lay traps… They
aren’t intelligent ! Unlike you, they’re stupid enough to follow orders
!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: That’ll be all, Major. Dismissed.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: This conference is over. Do your duty,
Lieutenant. That’s an order.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Corporal, the Roughnecks are moving out for
Planet P immediately. Get yourself squared away and report to Gillespie
for logistics.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yes, sir !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Who’s that with you ?</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Report in ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Planet P ? What kind of name is that ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: They ran out of names a long time ago in
this part of the galaxy.</p>
<p><strong>gillespie</strong>: I don’t understand it, Lieutenant. It’s
not getting anything from 4th Brigade… not even their transponder.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Keep trying, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Johnny, watch out !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Gillespie, put in call for retrieval. We’re
off this rock. Gillespie, do you read me ?</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Throw a rifle !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: I expext any one here to do the same for
me… Rico, Watkins, Flores, Levy prepare for rear guard action. The rest

<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Jeez, Command really humped the bunk on
this one…</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Rico, you’re acting Sergeant now. My last
Sergeant lost the com pack. Put together a search team and find the

<p><strong>ace</strong>: Lieutenant, I think you’re gonna wanna see

<p><strong>general owen</strong>: At ease, Lieutenant. Thank God for
you, for all of you…this is grand… so where’s the boat ?</p>
<p><strong>general owen</strong>: I was forced to hide, of course. The
security of the Federation in this theater of operations was at stake

<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Diz, what’s with the uplink ?</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: Workin on it…!</p>
<p><strong>general owen</strong>: They get in your mind… they make you

<p><strong>general owen</strong>: Oh, you can be sure of it ! They were
biding their time… waiting for the most opportune moment !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: To all Roughnecks, this is Rasczak. Prepare
for attack. Repeat. We are going to be attacked…!</p>
<p><strong>general owen</strong>: They weren’t gonna do it to me. Oh no
! I know too many secrets !</p>
<p><strong>sugar watkins</strong>: Fire in the hole !</p>
<p><strong>general owen</strong>: Oh God…! My soldiers…! All of my boys
and girls…!</p>
<p><strong>lt. rasczak</strong>: Shut up ! Your soldier’s dead and
you’re not !</p>
<p><strong>general owen</strong>: I know… I wish you’d shoot me…</p>
<p><strong>lt. rasczak</strong>: I oughta !</p>

<p><strong>sugar watkins</strong>: General ! GENERAL, stay with the
wounded… Sir, the general…!</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Ah, the hell with him…</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Fall back… form a circle ! If no living bug
comes over that wall, we cannot be harmed.</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Rico, Flores, Watkins, Levy ! We control
the sky until retrieval !</p>
<p><strong>johnny et al</strong>: Yes, sir !</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Getting low here, sir !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: 300 rounds and counting, sir !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Make every shot count !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Sergeant, secure the boat !</p>

<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: I can’t My legs are gone… Get on the
boat…</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: Rico, tell’em to glass this goddam planet.
I’ve never seen so many bugs upstairs at the same time…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We’re not leaving you here, sir !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: This is my farm. Get on the boat, NOW !
That’s an order, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Give’em hell, sir !</p>
<p><strong>rasczak</strong>: C’mon you sons of bitches ! There’s no bug
alive can kill a real mAAAAAAA !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Hang on, Diz… don’t die on me…</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: I bought the farm, didn’t I, Johnny ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: No, you’re gonna be alright, Diz !</p>
<p><strong>dizzy</strong>: It’s alright ’cause I got to have you,
Johnny…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Get on the com and tell Fleet to glass that
rock…!</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: On whose authority, Corporal ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: This would be mine, sir. Acting Sergeant
John Rico. I’ve assumed command on this mission.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Johnny…! I thought you were dead !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m not, but alot of my soldiers are. Glass
the planet !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Rodger Young, this is inbound shuttle De
Ruyter with an official request from the Mobile Infantery to bombard
Planet P-11…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Negative on your request. Fleet Command has
the battle group on standby…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: …I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We gotta choke on the mud and the blood and
Fleet can’t be bothered to spit.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: No, I think something’s up. The Sky
Marshall’s here.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I thought you were KIA, Johnny…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: That was just a mix up.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: You look so… I don’t know, you look like
you’ve really been in it.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What happened to your eye ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Almost got knocked out of the sky over Big
K.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I like it. It’s kinda…you.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Where are you going ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: A funeral.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: That girl who died on the way up …his girl
?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: How do you feel about him now ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I don’t know, Zander.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Dizzy bought the farm. She was my good
friend, and friens are the best luck anyone gets… But in war, we must go
on without our friends. We take with us their memory, and we are left to
wonder if there is meaning in their death. Let me tell you what it is:
Dizzy bough the farm so we can keep on fighting.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Officer on deck !</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Please continue, Sergeant.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Dizzy wouldn’t want our tears. She’d want us
to remember her… with a vengeance. So go out and kill a bug for Dizzy.
Kill as many as you can. You are her revenge, and every bug you kill
honors her death.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Womb to tomb, cap trooper !</p>
<p><strong>roughnecks</strong>: Womb to tomb !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Well, look at this. The three of us back
together again.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: How are you, Carl ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Johnny, I’m sorry it had to be your unit on
Planet P. That mission had a very low survival probability…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Bugs laid a trap, didn’t they ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Elegant proof of intelligence, isn’t it ? We
thought there might be a brain on P.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: You knew and you sent them anyway ?</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: A colony has to reach a certain size before it
produces a Brain… we think 300 generations. Woulda too expensive to
launch an operation if there wasn’t a Brain…</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: You don’t approve. Well, too bad. We’re in
this for the species, boys and girls. It’s simple numbers, they have
more, and everyday I have to make decisions that send hundreds of people
like you to their deaths.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Didn’t they tell you, Colonel ? That’s what
cap troopres are good for.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: Hope you’re ready for more. We’re going back
to P to capture that Brain.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: The Roughnecks are always ready, sir.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: I hear they need a new Lieutenant… Want the
job ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’ll take it… until I get killed or you find
someone better.</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Hope you get your Brain Bug, Carl.</p>
<p><strong>carl</strong>: It’s good to see you two. It reminds me of the
way things were before…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Take care, wilya Johnny ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: See you on the bounce !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Where’s Lieutenant Barcalow ?</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: He requested a combat assignment. There’s
always a need for experienced pilots on the ground. I had no choice but
to let him go… He said you’d understand.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Officer on the deck !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I only have two rules. Rule one, everyone
fights. Rule two, no one quits. If you don’t do your job, I’ll kill you
myself. Do you get me ?</p>
<p><strong>roughnecks</strong>: We get you, sir !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Who’re all these kids ?</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: We got reinforced. Most of’em just got outa
boot…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We’re the old men, Ace.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We’ll take this high ground. Lookouts there
and therte and up there. If the bugs come upstairs in this
neighbor-hood, we’ll be the first to know.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Got it. Fleet tactical wants to know where they
can deploy the skimmers.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Down there on the flats, eh ? Listen up,
Roughnecks ! Our primary objective is to assist our friends from the
Fleet…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Alright, cut it out. We will deploy from
skimmers in teams of six. If the bugs open up a battery, we put it out
of business. Any questions ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Would’ya mind moving your boat ?</p>
<p><strong>fleet officer</strong>: Better talk to the boss.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You’re standing on my H.Q., Lieutenant !</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: This is a Fleet-driven operation, son, and
the Fleet thinks my boat will be safer on the high ground. You can have
everything else, eh ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You heard the Sky Marshall… Move it all down
-</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Rodger Young, prepare to receice outgoing
fire…! I’ll take the first group.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Saddle up, boys, that’s our trash !</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Evasive action !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Prepare for warp !</p>
<p><strong>new number 2</strong>: Yes, ma’am ! Warp in 5… 4… 3…!</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: This is Rodger Young, we’re going down…
Repeat, this is Rodger Young, we’re going down…!</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Ibanez…LET’S GO !</p>
<p><strong>deladier</strong>: Leave me, Lieutenant ! That’s an order
!</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: No way, ma’am !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Mayday, mayday ! This is Lieutenant Carmen
Ibanez in lifepod RY63… I’m going in…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: What’s your problem now, Lieutenant ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: The Rodger Young just burned up…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Any survivors ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: This is Lieutenant Carmen Ibanez. Is anyone
receiving ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Affirmative ! Carmen, this is Roughneck base
camp… What is your present location ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: My present location is 42 degrees South by
176 degrees East… situation is extremely hostile…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We’ve gotta go get her !</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: You know as well as I do she’s probably
already dead.</p>
<p><strong>sugar watkins</strong>: Here they come !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: We’re outa here. Lieutenant, get your men
into the skimmers. This real estate’s about to go buggy.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Hey, just calm down, I’m giving the orders
here-</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Form a perimeter !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Make yourself useful, fly boy…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Ace, get on the com. Tell Fleet we need
retrieval… Sugar, salvage some armor and suit up Lieutenant
Barcalow.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Fleet Command says retrieval’s no go. The
battle group’s at safe distance… and we got another problem.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Looks like they’re gonna hose us down…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Alright… Listen up, Roughnecks. We’re gonna
head west down through bug city, pick up any Rodger Young survivors we
run across, and join A Company. Get me ?</p>
<p><strong>roughnecks</strong>: We get you, sir !</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: What do you think you’re doing ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’m gonna save Carmen.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: That would mean a comlete disregard for the
mission objective. They hang you for that, Rico.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Move out.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Bug hunt !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Mr. Barcalow, save power, don’t waste it on
workers… Ace, tell Aardvark we’re on our way…</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Yes, sir !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sugar, close the tunnel…!</p>
<p><strong>sugar</strong>: Fire in the hole !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: You know what this is…?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Sure you do… You’re a big fat smart bug,
aren’t you ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: I’ll take you with me.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Take my hand !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Roughnecks…NOW !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Weapon !</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Are you hurt ?</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Johnny…!</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Zander…! Oh, you’re hurt.</p>
<p><strong>ace</strong>: Ah geez…</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Can you walk ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: Not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Let’s get some armor on her, and the we’ll
get outa this stinkin bug hole !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: I thought I was dead. Lucky for me you
jokers showed up, eh ?</p>
<p><strong>zander</strong>: It wasn’t luck. Rico ignored the mission
objective to rescue you…</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Is it true ?</p>
<p><strong>johnny</strong>: Yeah, if I live through this, they’ll
probably hang me. Now com’on, let’s move out !</p>
<p><strong>carmen</strong>: Which way ?</p>
