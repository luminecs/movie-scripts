<p><strong>director josef</strong>: You keep your work station so clean,
Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: –Next to Godliness, isn’t that what they
say?</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: I reviewed your flight plan. Not one
error in a hundred thousand keystrokes. Phenomenal. It’s right that
someone like you is taking us to the Belt. You have a substance
test.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Jerome…never shy. Pisses on command. You’ve
got a beautiful cock. I ever told you that, Jerome?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Only every time I’m in here.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: I see a lot of cocks. I speak from
experience. Yours is a beautiful example. Why didn’t my folks order a
cock like that for me?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: If everything goes to plan, this could be the
last time I see you for a while. One week to go. Please tell me you’re
the least bit excited.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I’ll tell you at the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: The most unremarkable of events. Jerome
Morrow, Navigator First class, is only days away from a one-year manned
mission to 951 Gaspra in the Outer Asteroid Belt. Nothing so unique in
that. Last year over one thousand citizens from every walk of life
embarked on some space mission or other. Besides, selection for Jerome
was virtually guaranteed at birth. He is blessed with all the physical
and intellectual gifts required for such an arduous undertaking, a
genetic quotient second to none.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: No, there is truly nothing remarkable about
the progress of Jerome Morrow, except that I am not Jerome Morrow.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I was conceived in the Riviera. Not the
French Riviera.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: The Detroit variety.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: They used to say that a child conceived in
love, has a greater chance of happiness. They don’t say that any
more.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I can’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: I told you, the government pays. It’s all
taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No, you don’t understand. I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The doctor will give you something.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: I’m not doing it.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Honey, you’ve made one mistake–</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: –I’ve read your profile. I don’t know about
the father but you carry enough hereditary factors on your own. You can
have other children.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Not like this one.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Honey, look around you. The world doesn’t
want one like that one.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: You don’t know what it will be!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The child won’t thank you!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Those were early days–days when a priest
could still persuade someone to put their faith in God’s hands rather
than those of the local geneticist.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Of course, there was nothing wrong with me.
Not so long ago I would have been considered a perfectly healthy, normal
baby. Ten fingers, ten toes. That was all that used to matter. But now
my immediate well-being was not the sole concern.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: My destiny was mapped out before me– all my
flaws, predispositions and susceptibilities - most untreatable to this
day. Only minutes old, the date and cause of my death was already
known.</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The name? For the certificate.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Antonio–</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: –No, Vincent Antonio.</p>
<p><strong>2-year-old jerome</strong>: running with a toy rocket falls
more in clumsiness than fatigue. MARIA suddenly whisks up the
toddler.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Oh, Vincent, Vincent, Vincent…I can’t let you
out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I was born Vincent Antonio Luca. And from an
early age I came to think of myself as others thought of me -
chronically ill. Every skinned knee and runny nose treated as if it were
life-threatening.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: And my parents soon realized that wherever I
went, my genetic prophecy preceded me.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: They put off having any more children until
they could afford not to gamble - to bring a child into the world in
what has become the “natural” way.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: It meant selling the beloved Buick.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: My father got a good price. After all, the
only accident he’d ever had in that car was me.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: Put up the dish.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: Your extracted eggs… …Maria, have been
fertilized with… Antonio’s sperm and we have performed an analysis of
the resulting pre-embryos. After screening we’re left with two healthy
boys and two healthy girls. Naturally, no critical pre-dispositions to
any of the major inheritable diseases. All that remains is to select the
most compatible candidate.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: First, we may as well decide on gender.
Have you given it any thought?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: We would like Vincent to have a brother… you
know, to play with.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: You’ve already specified blue eyes, dark
hair and fair skin. I have taken the liberty of eradicating any
potentially prejudicial conditions - premature baldness, myopia,
alcoholism and addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence and
obesity–</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: –We didn’t want–diseases, yes.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: We were wondering if we should leave some
things to chance.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: You want to give your child the best
possible start. Believe me, we have enough imperfection built-in
already. Your child doesn’t need any additional burdens. And keep in
mind, this child is still you, simply the best of you. You could
conceive naturally a thousand times and never get such a result.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: He’s right, Maria. That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: Is there any reason you’d want a
left-handed child?</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Er, no…</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: Some believe it is associated with
creativity, although there’s no evidence. Also for sports like baseball
it can be an advantage.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: I like football.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: I have to warn you, Mr Luca, he’s going
to be at least a head taller than you. Prepare for a crick in the neck
in sixteen years time.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: Anything I’ve forgotten?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: We want him–we were hoping he would get
married and have children. We’d like grandchildren.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: I understand. That’s already been taken
care of. Now you appreciate I can only work with the raw material I have
at my disposal but for a little extra…I could also attempt to insert
sequences associated with enhanced mathematical or musical ability.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Antonio, the choir…</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: I have to caution you it’s not
fool-proof. With multi-gene traits there can be no guarantees.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: How much extra?</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: It would be five thousand more.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: I’m sorry, there’s no way we can.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: Don’t worry. You’ll probably do just as
well singing to him in the womb. We can implant the most successful
pre-embryo tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: What will happen to the others?</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: They are not babies, Maria, merely
“human possibilities”.</p>
<p><strong>geneticist</strong>: Smaller than a grain of sand.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: That’s how my brother, Anton, came into the
world - a son my father considered worthy of his name.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: By the time we were playing at blood
brothers I understood that there was something very different flowing
through my veins.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: And I’d need an awful lot more than a drop
if I was going to get anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Our favorite game was “chicken”. When our
parents weren’t watching, we used to swim outside the flags, as far out
as we dared. It was about who would get scared and turn back first.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Of course, it was always me. Anton was by
far the stronger swimmer and he had no excuse to fail.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: My genetic scarlet letter continued to
follow me from school to school. When you’re told you’re prone to
learning disabilities, it’s sometimes easier not to disappoint
anybody.</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: How many astronauts are there, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: I bet I could be one.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You’re standing on Venus.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I was popular enough until it got around
that I wasn’t a long-term proposition.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Those who didn’t know already could easily
find out for themselves. It was certainly no problem coaxing the
information out of me.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I didn’t blame them. You need to know if a
prospective husband can qualify for a mortgage or life insurance or can
hold down a decent job.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Vincent, you have to be realistic. A heart
condition like yours–</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: –I don’t care. I’ll take the risk.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: It’s not just you they have to be concerned
about. Perhaps we could get you one of those new pacemakers. They’re not
perfect but–</p>
<p><strong>father</strong>: For God’s sake, Vincent, don’t you
understand. The only way you’ll see the inside of a space ship is if
you’re cleaning it!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: My father was right. It didn’t matter how
much I lied on my resum�, my real C.V. was in my cells. Why should
anybody invest all that money to train me, when there are a thousand
other applicants with a far cleaner profile? Of course, it’s illegal to
discriminate - “genoism” it’s called - but no one takes the laws
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: If you refuse to disclose, they can always
take a sample from a doorhandle…</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: …or a handshake…</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: …even the saliva off your application
form.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: But for the most part we know who we are.
And if all else fails, a legal drug test can just as easily become an
illegal peek at your future in the company.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I didn’t blame Anton for his free ride. You
can’t blame someone for winning the lottery.</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: You sure you want to do this?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: It was the last time we swam together. Out
into the open sea, like always, knowing each stroke towards the horizon
was one we had to make back to the shore. Like always, the unspoken
contest.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Vincent, you damn fool! You could have
killed Anton with your ridiculous contest! Why should he risk his life
to save yours?! When are you going to get it through your thick head–you
can’t compete with your brother! Why try?!</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: Why didn’t you say anything?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why didn’t you? It’s okay. It’s the way
they want it.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: It confirmed everything in the minds of my
parents - that they had taken the right course with my younger brother
and the wrong course with me. It would have been so much easier for
everyone if I had slipped away that day. I decided to grant them that
wish.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Like many others in my situation, I moved
around a lot in the next few years, getting work where I could. I must
have cleaned half the toilets in the state.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: When you clean the glass, Vincent, don’t
clean it too well.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: You might get ideas.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: But if the glass is clean, it’ll be easier
for you to see me when I’m on the other side of it.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Where’s Earl?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: He fell. Lucky it was only the second
floor.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Of course the best test score in the world
wasn’t going to get me in the front door unless I had the blood test to
go with it.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: Vincent, I’m German– That’s my name.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: I think I could do something provided you
know what you’re doing and you can meet the terms.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: You got a photo of yourself?</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: I thought I told you not to get any
ideas.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: Vincent…Vincent…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: German, is that you?</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: Vincent, come down. I’ve found him.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: For the genetically superior, success is
easier to attain but is by no means guaranteed. After all, there is no
gene for fate. And when, for one reason or another, a member of the
elite falls on hard times, their genetic identity becomes a valued
commodity for the unscrupulous. One man’s loss is another man’s
gain.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: He has the heart of an ox. He could run
through a Goddamn wall–if he could still run. Actually, he was a big
college swimming star.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I hope he’s not just a body.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: No problem. Before he dropped out he was an
honor student, the right majors–</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How do I square the accident?</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: It happened in Australasia. He checked in
yesterday. No family complications, no record he ever broke his neck. As
far as anybody’s concerned, he’s still a walking, talking,
fully-productive member of society. You just have to get him off the
pipe and fill in the last two years of his life. Excuse me, your
life.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: What did I tell you? Which one’s the
mirror?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s the hair color in his profile?</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’d have to bleach my hair.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: Why are you inventing problems? You two are
a couple of goddam clones. You look so right together, I want to double
my fee.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How tall are you?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Four foot six.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Okay, how tall did you used to be?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Six one.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: He’s too tall.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: You can wear lifts.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Even with lifts I’m never that tall.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: There’s a way.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I confess, at first I wondered if I had
rescued a man who was already dead.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You okay, Jerome?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Yeah. You want to go dancing tonight?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What’s wrong with it?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I think I’d better choose the menu. After
all, you’re learning how to be me, I’m not learning how to be you.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Suit yourself.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Listen, I don’t want you to think I’m
ungrateful –I know you and that little broker–what do you call him?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: German.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You’re both going to a lot of trouble– Maybe
you can con somebody into believing you’re me to get your foot in the
door–but once you’re inside, you’re on your own. I’m sure you’re
sincere… …but I was being groomed for something like this myself. Even
without the accident I don’t think I would have made it. My point is–how
the hell do you expect to pull this off?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I don’t know exactly, Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: At least you’re honest. Call me by my middle
name–Eugene–If you’re going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting
used to it.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I have to know where you come from.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: If anybody asks, tell them the truth– your
family disowns you. You are a disappointment, Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What about this?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Wrong color. It’s silver. It’s not easy
living up to this.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: It needs work.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You had to be a right-hander.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Noone orders southpaws anymore.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Myopia is a dead giveaway - one of the
earliest and most justifiable of the quality-of-life corrections.
Anybody with impaired vision is certain to be suffering from all the
other deficiencies of a “nonadvantaged” birth.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: It’s no good. I can see an edge. He may as
well walk in there with a cane.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You really need that much?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: More than that. You’ll get used to it.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: God, what wouldn’t you do to leave the
planet?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Leave? Just a few million years ago every
atom in this hair–in our bodies–was a part of a star. I don’t see it as
leaving. I see it as going home.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: God, you’re serious, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: It’s not too late to back out.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You don’t know what a relief it is not to be
me. Are you sure you want the job?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What about you? What’s in this for you,
Eugene?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as
well pay my rent.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What about the interview?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: That was it.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: The majority of people are now
made-to-order. What began as a means to rid society of inheritable
diseases has become a way to design your offspring–the line between
health and enhancement blurred forever. Eyes can always be brighter, a
voice purer, a mind sharper, a body stronger, a life longer. Everyone
seeks to give their child the best chance but the most skilled
geneticists are only accessible to the priveleged few.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Anyone who is the product of an altered DNA
is proudly referred to as a “DAN”, “self-made man or woman”,
“man-child”.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Those parents who, for moral or, more likely
economic reasons, refrain from tampering with their offspring’s genetic
makeup or who fail to abort a deprived fetus condemn their children to a
life of routine discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Officially they are called “In-Valids”. Also
known as “godchildren”, “men-of-god”, “faith births”, “blackjack
births”, “deficients”, “defectives”, “genojunk”, “ge-gnomes”, “the
fucked-up people”.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: They are the “healthy ill”. They don’t
actually have anything yet - they may never. But since few of the
pre-conditions can be cured or reversed, it is easier to treat them as
if they were already sick.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: By means of a donor I have cheated the
system for the last four years to open doors that would otherwise be
closed to me.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: In the guise of Jerome Morror I have risen
quickly through the ranks of Gattaca. Only one of the Mission Directors
has ever come close to discovering my true identity.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Strange to think, he may have more success
exposing me in death than he did in life.</p>
<p><strong>employee 1</strong>: Awful.</p>
<p><strong>employee 2</strong>: Yeah, awful it didn’t happen sooner.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: You’re lucky to be getting out of
this.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: We’re still going ahead as planned?</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: The launch window is only open until
week’s end. Tragic though this event may be, it hasn’t stopped the
planets turning.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: You’ll have to excuse me, Jerome. I
have to meet with the authorities–naturally, we’re co-operating in any
way, although I won’t tolerate a major disruption. I wish I was going
with you, Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Thank you for your co-operation. Please
return to your work stations immediately.</p>
<p><strong>employee 3</strong>: What, no counselling?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Excuse me, Jerome. I’m sorry to bother
you.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: No bother.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’ve been asked to compile a log for the
investigators–they want to know everyone’s whereabouts last night.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Last night? I was at home.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Can that be, er, verified? Were you
alone?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: No it can’t be verified. Yes I was
alone.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Looks bad, doesn’t it, Irene? What about
you? Where were you last night?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I was at home.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Were you alone?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: So we don’t know for sure about you,
either.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Why don’t we say we were together?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Why would we do that?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I have better things to do this week than
answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Well, shall we say we spent the evening
together?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: To be convincing, Jerome, I would have to
know what that was like.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You didn’t forget the truffles?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Who died?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: The Mission Director.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You wish.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: They found him in his office this morning–
beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: What an act of benevolence–a service to the
community. So that’s it. Now there’s nothing between you and
ignition.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: He was still warm when they confirmed.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: This calls for a celebration. Doesn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: The place is crawling with Hoovers.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: So what? You didn’t kill him, did you?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: That’s not the point.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if
the “J. Edgars” do find something, in a week– you’ll be slightly out of
their jurisdiction. Come on, we’ve got to get drunk immediately.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You’re going to have to earn your supper.
I’ve got my final physical tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: How old?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: The specimen.</p>
<p><strong>youung woman</strong>: I kissed him five minutes ago. A real
good one.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: 9.4…very nice.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Good evening, gentlemen. Your table is
ready. Not long now, sir. You’ll be upstairs before you know it. We’re
going to miss you.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Not as much as I’ll miss your Stroganoff.
I’d like to take one of your chefs with me.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I’m so sorry. Did I hurt you?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Honey, if you’d hurt me, I’d be cured.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You want to meet a real-life spaceman?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Let’s get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You’re right, there’s more atmosphere where
you’re going.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You drive.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I gotta stop!! I gotta stop!!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Keep going!! Keep going!!</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You idiot. You could ruin everything with a
stunt like that.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: At least up there your piss will be worth
something. You’ll all be showering in it, right?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: And drinking it. It’s like Evian by the time
it’s filtered.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: What is that one?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: 11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: How long do you stay up there before you
go?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: A day or so.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I still can’t believe they’re sending you to
the Belt–you of all people–never meant to be born, on a mission to
discover the origin of life.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You should be going instead of me.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Up there they wouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You know I’m scared of heights.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Let’s see what you’ve got to say for
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: The tongue is male. Mature. Blonse hair.
Brown eyes. Light complexion. Between 5’11 and 6’1. Pronounced Caucasian
nose. Thin lips. Weak chin. Lobeless ears. Prematurely balding. Slightly
bow-legged. Broad shoulders. Barrel chest… Blind.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Blind? The tongue is blind?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Who cuts out the tongue of a blind
man?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Someone who is mindful that the blind
still speak.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I’m sorry. Did you want it?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Let me get it for you.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: It’s okay, Eugene.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You know I wasn’t drunk–I knew what I was
doing when I walked in front of that car–</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: –What car?–Go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: –I walked right in front of it. I was never
more sober in my life.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I’m proud of you, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You must be drunk to call me Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: I don’t understand why you were
dragged out here, Sir. It’s hardly worth wasting your time–a no-nothing
case like this.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: A man’s dead, Detective.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: Of course, Sir. We’re checking the
entry log, alibis, grudges…</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Grudges?</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: I look around, I see a lot of dry
eyes. The Director was not… …universally loved. He was leading the
cut-backs in the program. You’re looking at a room full of motives.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: No, this is your man.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: With respect, Sir–it may be the only
unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests–</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: –What about his profile?</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: According to this, he’s a sick man.
Congenital heart condition. Who knows how long the specimen has been
here but there’s an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has
already died himself from natural causes.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: So there’s a 20 percent chance he’s
not dead.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: Even if this Vincent Luca is alive,
is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: No. Not likely.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: I take it you’re thinking along the
lines of a robbery gone sour–a thief disturbed in the act?</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: Of course that doesn’t jibe with
what we found. This was an angry killing.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Who knows with these “deficients”? His
profile indicates a proclivity for violence.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: I’ll run a crossover on the eyelash
for any family or associate connections–</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: –I’ve already run it. There’s no
record of any living relative.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: What a pity.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Detective Hugo, it’s a simple case of
lost and found. All we have to do is locate the man who’s minus an
eyelash and this murder will solve itself.</p>
<p><strong>medical director</strong>: Napoleon, you’re late for your
substance test.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Director, Napoleon’s helping me today.</p>
<p><strong>medical director</strong>: Well, you take it for him,
Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>napoleon</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>trainer</strong>: You’re excused, Irene. You may resume your
duties.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Six miles later it’s still beating like a
Goddamn metronome. I could play piano by that heartbeat of his.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: Director Josef, this is our lead
Investigator.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: How often do you test, Director?</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: Often.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Surely you know what you have.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: We have to be certain. Once they’re
up, we can hardly turn the boat around.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: I swear if I went to lunch and came back,
he’d still be there.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: We believe we have a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: What a relief.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: This unaccountable specimen was found
in the south wing corridor.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: An age enhancement is being prepared
as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: Irene will make it available to
security.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: I’ll take care of that for you, Mr
Morrow.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: We were looking at each other. You
stopped.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: We were just looking.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I know about you.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Here, take it.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: If you’re still interested, let me know.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Sorry, the wind caught it.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Have they found our friend?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Friend?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: It was a mercy-killing after all.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: They found an eyelash.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: In the South Wing.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Does it have a name?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Just some In-Valid. Vincent– –somebody.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You celebrate, Jerome?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: –I know what I ordered. I ordered “Honey
Dawn” and you sent me “Summer Wheat”.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Call German.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Any particular reason?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: We can’t stay here.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: They think I offed the Director.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: What makes them think that?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: They found my eyelash.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: In a corridor.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Could be worse. They could have found it in
your eye.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Come on–we’re taking off.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I’m not going anywhere. Less than a week to
go. Not on your life–</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: –You don’t understand, they’ll make the
connection, they’ll hoover again. We should cut our losses.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Where is your head, Jerome? You’re acting
like a guilty man. They won’t marry the eyelash to you. They won’t
believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for
the last five years.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: They’ll recognize me.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: How could they recognize you? I don’t
recognize you. Anyway, you don’t have a choice. You run, you may as well
sign a confession, turn us both in right now. No, we stick this out–
find out what we can but change nothing. This is a minor inconvenience
is all it is. We’ve taken worse heat than this. Jesus, if I’d known you
were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn’t
have bothered. You can’t quit on me now. I’ve put too much into this.
Besides, this stuff is mine. I had other offers, you know. I could have
rented myself out to somebody with a spine. You want me to wheel in
there and finish the job myself? We’ll take off all right, from pad 18
just like we planned.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: And keep your lashes on your lids where they
belong. How could you be so careless?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I’m sorry. I think I was crying.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Well save those tears.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You really had other offers?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I’m sure I could have.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Mind if I borrow a tie?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: So it’s not just the Hoovers who’ve got you
rattled.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You’re the one who said not to change
anything. She’s my ear to the investigation.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Is that all?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I’ve got enough on my mind without that.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: If you say so. The stripe.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Good choice.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Not thirsty? We’ve got enough virgin samples
to last us the week.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I don’t feel too good. I think I’m still
drunk from last night.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Never stopped you before. And for God’s sake
stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure
you wouldn’t go bald.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: If I were you I’d worry about myself.
Haven’t you forgotten something?</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: We still need to overhaul the back-up
generator. What’s going on, Eugene, I thought he was going away, not
you–you going on vacation?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You got it, German.</p>
<p><strong>german</strong>: You deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: Not our fish, but sometihng stuck in
the net.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: This is the age enhancement we’re
working with.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: As you requested, we’ve kept the
parameters wider than usual.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: We’re in the wrong place. We’re
wasting time.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: This is the most likely
location–</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: –There’s that word again. I have a
feeling This man doesn’t play the odds, Detective. Not exactly a slave
to probability. Is it “likely” that a man who has successfully eluded
authorities for fifteen years–a brutal killer–is going to come to us now
like a lamb?</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: Is there something more we should
know about this suspect, Sir? I mean besides what’s on his sheet.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Since going underground, traces of
this In-Valid have shown up at the scene of four serious felonies. Do
you need any more than that?</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: With respect, Sir, many perfectly
innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes. Maybe
he’s just unlucky.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: I don’t like anybody this unlucky.
Widen the sweep. The West side. Draw a five mile radius around Gattaca.
Hoover some of the classier establishments. Random car stops.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: We’re already getting complaints
about frivolous search.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: This is a murder investigation. The
public should be happy to co-operate, to get this disease off the
streets.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You didn’t know?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Yes…yes…</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You’re angry–</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Why would I be angry? It was beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shit! One of those Hoovers is back.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s alright. He’s here to see me.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sonja, I can’t see anyone else tonight.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I don’t understand you, Investigator.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You hunt us by day and fuck us by night. Do
you only get it up for In-valids?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Wouldn’t you be happier with one of your
made-to-order whores?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: You are so beautiful, are you sure you
weren’t altered? This is not the face, the body, of a Godchild. How
could something so lovely be a product of chance?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Is that what keeps you coming back? Look at
you. Such angry, beautiful, perfect eyes. Do you ever wonder what they
would see if they weren’t quite so perfect? They will never see what I
see.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: You have so much wrong with you,
you’ll be lucky to see next year.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Are you so much more alive,
Investigator?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: I’m not paying you to talk.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Better not. Don’t want to give you a
contaminated specimen…if you get my meaning.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Thanks. You never know where those swabs
have been.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I want to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: other side, mindful of the light</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Come on. We’ll miss it.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What did I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I envy you, Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You’ll be next.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I don’t think so. The only trip I’ll make in
space is around the sun– –on this satellite right here.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: –Listen, I don’t want to waste your time and
I really don’t want you to waste mine. I don’t know what you’re after
but I have a feeling I’m not it.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: It’s here. My heart. I’m careful–weekly
check-ups. I’m on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet– I
just want you to know what you’d be getting yourself into.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What exactly is wrong?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Nothing yet. I’ll start experiencing symptoms
in my late-fifties. But unless they come up with something between now
and then, I won’t live much past 67.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Of course I think about it every day.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: How was your evening?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Complicated. I couldn’t stop her
apologizing.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You are a catch. No doubt she’s worried that
she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to
“breed up”. What’s wrong with her?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You know how it is with these altered births
–somebody told her she’s not going to live forever and she’s been
preparing to die ever since.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You’re not thinking of telling her, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Of course not. But she’s have to know
eventually.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: She doesn’t have to know. She doesn’t want
to know.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: The skin flake was found in
Michael’s Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: A customer? Does this Michael’s cater
to misfits?</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: No. But one or two “borrowed
ladders” have shown up there in the past.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: We have to consider the possibility
that he’s playing somebody else’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Of course. He’s a “de-gene-erate”. He
works at Gattaca. Why else would we find the eyelash near the washroom?
Nobody stops to take a leak during a murder.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: It’s still possible the eyelash
specimen came from a janitor, delivery man–it could have blown in
through an open window.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: He was afraid of being exposed. That’s
why he did it.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: It is hard to believe he could be
one of their elite workers. You’ve seen their security system. They know
who works there. Even if you ignore the man’s expiration date, his
profile suggests that he doesn’t have the mathematical propensity let
alone the stamina to pass their physicals.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Don’t underestimate these
imposters.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: None of the ID photos match the
enhancement.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: A man can change his face–but blood is
forever. Sample every employee within the parameters I gave you.
Intravenous.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: You know their workforce. Two-thirds
at least fall into the category. We’ll be closing down their operation
for days. At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Blood. From the vein.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: Look like anybody to you?</p>
<p><strong>younger janitor</strong>: Not to me.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: Ugly sonofabitch though, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: –Somewhere in the dust of Gaspra is
the key. Back to the beginning of the book–the life we became. With the
original building blocks who knows how far we can take “the
godding”.</p>
<p><strong>mission commander</strong>: Even someone as advanced as
Jerome will be last year’s model by the time we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I wouldn’t get your hopes up, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Excuse me, Mr Morrow. The investigators have
begun their testing.</p>
<p><strong>detective josef</strong>: This is so inconvenient, Irene.
They can make an exception for Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’m afraid not.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: I apologize, Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: It’s not yor fault, Director. If your
predecessor were still around we may not be going to Gaspra at all.
That’s what I would call inconvenient.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What’s with the plungers, Lamar? What are
you doing, opening a blood bank?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: The gentlemen of law enforcement are
concerned that my testing methods may have been compromised.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Damn!!</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Jesus–I’m sorry, Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You must be out of practise, Lamar.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: I’ve got enough here.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Need any more, you can always get it off his
shoes.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: So you didn’t do it after all.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I guess somebody beat me to it.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: That’s the last.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Something’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: He’s not here. It’s a blind
alley.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: No, we’ve missed something. We Hoover
again.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: We don’t have the manpower.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Get it. From outside, if you have
to.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: From what budget?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: I’ll take it out of your damn pension
if you question my authority one more time!</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: Would you care to look–in the
telescope?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Thank you, no.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: One look through there and you would
know why I can’t possibly allow you to disrupt operations any
further.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: You’re so unconcerned that you have a
killer in your midst.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: Right now, your presence is creating
more of a threat. I don’t think you have any concept of what we do
here–how meticulous our preparations must be. We are about to send
twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with
an object the size of a house and the color of coal. So it’s rather
critical to point them in the right direction. And we certainly don’t
need you looking over our shoulders. Besides, I don’t believe there is
any evidence that the killer is amongst us. I don’t see too many other
dead bodies littering the place.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: No, but since there aren’t too many
live ones tonight either, you won’t mind us conducting one further
sweep. If he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of
him. I think you’d better get some people out of bed, Detective. In the
meantime we can re-check his favorite haunt.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: You see, Director, I prefer my
microscope.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I’m sorry. I’ve got plans.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: She’s already got her doubts. I have to act
like nothing’s wrong.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I’m sure you’ll be very convincing.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Where are you taking her?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Michael’s.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Everybody goes there.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You may as well invite her here.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Will you be okay?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Don’t worry about your little pin cushion.
To be honest, I’m looking forward to having the place to myself.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: We’ll still be able to talk when I’m away.
The conversation will just keep getting longer.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: By the time I’m at the Belt, you phone and
say, “How are you?” Forty-five minutes later I reply, “Not bad. How are
you?”</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I guess I’d better have something important
to say if it takes that long to get an answer.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What is this place?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You’ve never been here? Let me order for
you.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’d better not.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: So sure of what you can’t do. Do you even
know what it tastes like, Irene?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Take the side door.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Check for lenses, hairpieces–</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Why are we leaving?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Those checks take forever.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Jerome!</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What about the car?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Let’s walk.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: It’s not safe. I shouldn’t have brought you
here.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: My medication. I left it back there.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: We’ll get it later. Irene, please.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: You run a clean establishment.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Are you a health inspector?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Do you recognize this man?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: My eyes aren’t so good.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: I bet.</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: Sir.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Did he hit you with his fist?</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: More like a hammer.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Don’t touch your face. Don’t swallow.
Don’t spit. Quick, clean his teeth.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Are you trying to kill me? Are you?! Don’t
you understand, I can’t do that!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You just did.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Vincent! Vincent!</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: What are you waiting for?</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: Where do we start?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: We’ll vacuum these streets if we have
to.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: We caught them trying to flush these,
Sir.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: So sure of what you can’t do.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You remember the ’99 Chrysler LeBaron? It’s
the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: So you’re not so smart after all. I want you
to know–if it ever came to it– I’d be willing to get an ovum from the
Egg Bank. In fact, I’d rather use a donor egg– –if it came to it.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: But “if it came to it” then it couldn’t have
your– –nose. How perfect does your child have to be?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: You hypocrite. Do you think for one moment
you’d be doing what you’re doing if it wasn’t for who you are–what you
are? Don’t you get any satisfaction knowing that your children will be
able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: That’s precisely what scaresme–that they
won’t do anything foolish or courageous or anything–worth a Goddamn.</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: My wife and I–we’re thinking of starting a
family.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: These new personality corrections I’ve been
reading about.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: You worried about the cost?</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: Not that.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: They said the same thing about myopia
and obesity. You think your children would be less human if they were
less violent, angry, spiteful? Maybe they’d be more human. From where I
sit the world could stand a little improving.</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Don’t touch that. It’s evidence.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: Positive saliva match. The cup was
definitely used since the original sweep.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: So we have two choices. Either our
suspect came back to the murder scene for a drink of water and I don’t
know anybody that thirsty or… …he is here. We test again. You’re right,
Hugo, this was a desperate act. Someone had a lot to lose that
night–perhaps their place in line. I’d like the profiles of everyone
with an upcoming mission.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: Twelve have a mission within the
week.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: This time I will supervise each test
personally.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I forgot something–something at home. I’ll
see you later.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’ll miss you.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: –when you go away.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: We could go together one day.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: He’s the only absentee.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: A little nausea. Quite common.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: At least it’s nothing contagious.</p>
<p><strong>director josef</strong>: I will not permit any further
testing on the eve of a mission. We’re already counting backwards.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’ll call and let him know.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Let’s not spoil the surprise. I
understand you can show us the way.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: How would you like to be yourself for the
day?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I was never very good at it, remember?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: You don’t know who he is, do you,
Irene?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: You think you have problems?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Jerome–?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Hello, sweatheart. Come on up.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Where’s my kiss?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Good to see you’re feeling better.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Now you’re here. Who are your “friends”?</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: It’s about the Director.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Again?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Forgive me for not getting up.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Couldn’t we do this another time?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: I don’t believe so.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: This won’t take a moment.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: It’s okay. Maybe they can find out what I’ve
got.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Mind if I take a leak?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: As long as you don’t do it in my closet.
Over there.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Clean the whole house if you want.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Actually, the kitchen needs doing.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: Yes?…Yes…yes…</p>
<p><strong>detective</strong>: Come quickly. We have him.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: How are you, Jerome?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Not bad, Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: How the hell did you get here.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I could always walk. I’ve been faking
it.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Irene.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: This can’t be him.</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: We found his spit in the dead
director’s eye. He’s signed a confession–supplied us with the suit he
wore on the night. What more do you want?</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Luca could still be an accomplice.</p>
<p><strong>mission commander</strong>: –Finally, I’d like to welcome
Navigator Morrow on his debut mission–if we get lost out there, nobody
has a map of the heavens in his head like Jerome.</p>
<p><strong>mission commander</strong>: I’m gratified that there is no
longer a cloud hanging over tomorrow’s launch. Now we can put this
unpleasantness behind us and concentrate on the task at hand. I don’t
have to tell you how important this mission is–the Belt could hold the
key to the origin of life - why we are what we are. I know many of you
have been asking that question about me for long enough. Gaspra–how
could something so ugly hold so many beautiful secrets?</p>
<p><strong>mission commander</strong>: Enjoy your final evening with
your families. We’ll all be a year older when they see us next. And
don’t be late tomorrow. You don’t want to miss this.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Hugo! I’ve found him!</p>
<p><strong>hugo</strong>: I’ve found him too.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: A fingerprint. There’s something to be
said for nostalgia. What did you find?</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: It’s not exactly him.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Where did you get this?</p>
<p><strong>detective hugo</strong>: But this man does share some common
characteristics with your suspect. Not so many but enough. It appears
the eyelash has a brother–of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: So you’ve finally seen sense and come back
to your old job, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Not yet, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: No? What’s keeping you?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I guess I’m a slow learner.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: I guess so. Well, while you’re up there,
maybe you could tidy the place up a bit.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: And don’t go getting everybody lost out
there. You’ll give us a bad name. You won’t have me to keep an eye on
you, you know.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: By the way, I left some trash in your
locker.</p>
<p><strong>caesar</strong>: I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Vincent–</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Vincent, what are you running
from?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: From Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>investigator</strong>: Has it been so long, you don’t
remember who I am?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Maybe it’s you who’s forgotten. What are you
doing here, Anton?</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: I could ask you the same question. I have a
right to be here, you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You almost sound like you believe that.</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: Come with me now, Vincent. You’ve gone as far
as you can go.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: There are a few million miles to go yet.</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: It’s over.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton,
to see me fail?</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: It’s for the best.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: God, even you want to tell me what I can’t
do. In case you hadn’t noticed, Anton, I don’t need rescuing. But you
did, once.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Well? You have all the answers. How is that
possible?</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: You didn’t beat me that day. I beat
myself.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Who are you trying to convince?</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: I will prove it to you. Come swim with me
now, Vincent. Now–tonight.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Quite something, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: That’s where we get rid of the traces of him
although we never truly succeeded.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: I’ve been looking for him. Do you know where
he is?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: He’s probably leaving some more of me around
the place before he goes.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Don’t be deceived, Irene. These are just the
clothes. He has to wear them. Something I could never do.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: What’s wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: You have more in common than you know.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: But they say hisis already ten thousand
beats overdue. I have my doubts. For all my gifts, they could never
engineer me a heart like Vincent’s.</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: How are you doing this, Vincent? How have you
done any of this?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Now is your chance to find out.</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: Vincent, where’s the shore? We’re too far
out. We have to go back!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Too late for that. We’re closer to the other
side.</p>
<p><strong>anton</strong>: What other side? How far do you want to go?!
Do you want to drown us both? How are we going to get back?!</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: You wanted to know how I did it. That’s how
I did it, Anton. I never saved anything for the swim back.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Here, take it.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: If you’re still interested, let me know.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Sorry, the wind caught it.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: A year is a long time.</p>
<p><strong>irene</strong>: Not so long–just once around the sun.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I have your samples ready.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Have you forgotten? I don’t need any samples
where I’m going.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: No, but you might need them when you get
back.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Everything you need to last you two
lifetimes.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: There’s an extra specimen. I wish I could
give it to her myself. But then, you always were better at being me.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Why have you done this?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: In case you get back before I do.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I’m travelling too.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: I got the better end of the deal. I just
lent you my body–you lent me your dream.</p>
<p><strong>eugene</strong>: Not until you’re upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: What’s this, Lamar?</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: New policy.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Flight got you nervous?</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: There’s a problem, Lamar.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Did I ever tell you about my son, Jerome?
He’s a big fan of yours. He wants to apply here.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up
and back and nobody would have been the wiser–</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: –Unfortunately my son’s not all that they
promised. But then, who know what he could do.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: For future reference– –righthanded men don’t
hold it with their left. It’s just one of those things.</p>
<p><strong>lamar</strong>: Have a safe trip, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>jerome</strong>: We came from the stars so they say, now it’s
time to go back. If I was conceived today, I would not get beyond eight
cells, and yet here I am. In a way they were right, I don’t have the
heart for this world. The question is, why am I having so much trouble
dying?</p>
