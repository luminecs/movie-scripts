<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: Admiral Dougherty is waiting for this.
Transmit it to the ship.</p>
<p><strong>male son’a com voice</strong>: Alert, area twelve…!</p>
<p><strong>male son’a com voice</strong>: … the android has…</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Data, report to base immediately.</p>
<p><strong>data’s com voice</strong>: Transferring… positronic… matrix
functions… engaging… secondary protocols…</p>
<p><strong>starfleet officer #1</strong>: He’s trying to remove the
headpiece…</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: All field units. Intercept the
android.</p>
<p><strong>12 omitted 12</strong>: THRU THRU 15 15</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: It must have been some kind of odd electrical
storm…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Secondary protocols… active.</p>
<p><strong>various ba’ku</strong>: What is it? Who are they?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: … Population three hundred million…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Say the greeting again…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Yew-cheen chef-faw… emphasis on the ‘cheen’
and the ‘faw’…</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: You either need a new uniform or a new
neck.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: ‘Yew-cheen chef-faw’… My collar size is
exactly the same as it was at the Academy.</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Sure it is. And your hair is still chestnut
brown.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Our guests have arrived and are eating the
floral arrangements on the banquet tables…</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: I guess they don’t believe in cocktails
before dinner…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Oh, my God, are they vegetarians? That’s not
in here…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Better have the chef whip up a light
balsamic vinaigrette… something that goes well with chrysanthemums…</p>
<p><strong>picard (cont’d) perim’s com voice</strong>: Yew-cheen
chef-faw… Bridge to Captain Picard…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Yes, Ensign…</p>
<p><strong>perim’s com voice</strong>: Command wants to know our ETA at
the Goren systsem…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: The Goren system…?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: They need us to mediate some territorial
dispute…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We can’t delay the archaeological expedition
to Hanoran Two. It would put us into the middle of monsoon season…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: The Diplomatic Corps is busy with Dominion
negotiations.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: … so they need us to put out one more brush
fire. Anyone remember when we used to be explorers?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: ‘Yew-cheen chef-faw.’</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Deck ten.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Remember; they have a significantly less
advanced technology than ours… they only achieved warp drive last
year…</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: A year? And the Federation Coucil decided
to make them a Protectorate already?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: In view of our losses to the Borg and the
Dominion, the Coucil feels we need all the allies we can get these
days.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: You’ll be expected to dance with Regent
Cuzar…</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Can she mambo…?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Very funny…</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Your Captain used to cut quite a rug…</p>
<p><strong>female ensign</strong>: Captain on deck!</p>
<p><strong>la forge’s com voice</strong>: La Forge to Picard. Captain, I
need to talk to you before you go into the reception…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Captain…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Worf, what the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>worf riker</strong>: I was at the Manzar colony It’s a little
late, installing a new defense Geordi… can it wait? perimeter when I
heard the Enterprise was in this sector…</p>
<p><strong>picard la forge’s com voice</strong>: Stop by my quarters
later; I don’t think so I have a few ideas about Commander.. Manzar
security… Have him come to the reception… we’ll talk here…</p>
<p><strong>picard riker</strong>: How’s your bride? The Captain wants
you to come over.</p>
<p><strong>worf la forge’s com voice</strong>: A challenge I’m on my
way… tell him we’ve recieved a PICARD communique from Admiral Then you
were made for Dougherty… each other.</p>
<p><strong>la forge’s com voice</strong>: It’s about Data.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Yew-cheen chef-faw, Regent Cuzar. Welcome
aboard the Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>cuzar</strong>: Captain Picard, may I welcome you in the
time-honored tradition of my people…</p>
<p><strong>cuzar</strong>: We are so honored to be accepted within the
great Federation family. Please, I know you have other guests to
greet…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We have a dance later, I believe?</p>
<p><strong>cuzar</strong>: I look forward to it.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How are we supposed to dance? Her head will
be in my…</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: Excuse me, sir. Admiral Dougherty’s aboard
the Son’a ship in sector four-four-one. He’s requesting Data’s
schematics…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: The message doesn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Data should have been back by now. They were
only scheduled to observe the Ba’ku village for a week. Set up a secured
com-link to the Admiral in the anteroom…</p>
<p><strong>bolian officer</strong>: Captain, Hars Adislo, we met at the
Nel Bato Conference last year… did you ever have a chance to read my
paper on thermionic transconductance…?</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: He’s not acknowledging any Starfleet
protocols… not responding to any of our hails…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You have no idea what precipitated his
behavior?</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: … And now he’s holding our people hostage
down there…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: The Enterprise can be at your position in
two days, Admiral…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: That’s probably not a good idea. Your
ship hasn’t been fitted for this region; there are environmental
concerns…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What kind of concerns?</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: We haven’t fully identified the anomalies
yet. They’re calling this whole area The Briar Patch… it took us a day
to reach a location where we could get a signal out to you. Just get me
Data’s schematics. I’ll keep you informed. Dougherty out.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Send him the schematics.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Ensign…</p>
<p><strong>ensign</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Report to the galley and tell the chef to
skip the fish course.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I want our guests to depart as quickly a
etiquette allows. I’ll ask Worf to delay his return to DS9 so he can
join us. We’re going to stop by sector four-four- one on our way to the
Goren system.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: They… are in opposite directions, sir…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Are they…?</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: I should have never let you talk me into the
duck blind in the first place…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Your Federation procedures have made this
mission ten times as difficult as it needed to be…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Our procedures were in place to protect
the planet’s population from unnecessary risk…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Planet’s population. Six hundred people. You
want to avoid unnecessary risks? Next time leave your android home.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #1’s com voice</strong>: Bridge to Ahdar
Ru’afo. We’re approaching the planet.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Take us into a high orbit. Lie down,
Admiral. The girls will take twenty years off your face…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Another time.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Your self-restraint puzzles me, Admiral. You
continue to deny yourself every benefit this mission has to offer…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: I prefer to wait until we can share the
benefits with all the people of the Federation…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Report.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #1</strong>: Phaser blast. Unknown origin.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Raise shields. Take us out of orbit.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #2</strong>: Photon torpedoes. Brace for
impact!</p>
<p><strong>son’a computer voice</strong>: Warning. Outer hull damage,
deck three…</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #1</strong>: Visual contact!</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: That’s our ship.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Commander Riker…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Come…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m the casualty of a working lunch.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’ve been going over the few star charts we
have of this “Briar Patch”. It’s full of supernova remnants, false
vacuum fluctuations…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: … and gorgonzolla cheese.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We won’t be able to go any faster than
one-third impulse in that muck…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Nothing dangerous turned up in the
astrometric survey…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: So where are the ‘environmental concerns’
the Admiral was talking about?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: The only unusual readings were low levels of
metaphasic radiation from interstellar dust across the region…</p>
<p><strong>worf’s com voice</strong>: Bridge to Captain Picard. We are
approaching sector four-four-one.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Slow to impulse. We’re on our way.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: We’re about to lose communications with
Starfleet, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Do you have everything you need from
command?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: We’ve downloaded all the files on the duck
blind mission as well as intelligence reports on the Son’a.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You have two days to become experts… Mister
Worf, your job and mine will be to find a plan to safely capture
Data.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: I’ve already modified a tricorder with one of
his spare actuation servos. Its operational range is only seven meters
but it should shut him down…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It’s good to have you back, Worf. Slow to
one-third. Take us in.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: The Son’a discovered an M-class planet with
humanoid life six months ago. Turned out it’s in us to get approval for
a sociological study. The Federation Council suggested it be a joint
mission…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Why was Data assigned?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: “Environmental concerns”, again. An android
could be safely exposed to the elements during the installation of a
duck blind…</p>
<p><strong>librarian</strong>: Sssshhh…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: I don’t see anything to suggest the Son’a
have any interest in sociology…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: What are they interested in…?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Wine, women and song.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: You should feel right at home with them.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Nomadic, collectors of precious metals,
jewels…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Hmm, I should feel right at home with
them…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: You’re in luck… it says here they’ve taken
women from several races as indentured servants.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Look at this…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: ‘The Son’a have been suspected of producing
mass quantities of the narcotic ketracel-white… their ships are rumored
to be equipped with isolytic subspace weapons outlawed by the Second
Khitomer Accord…’</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Why would we be involved with these
people?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Good question.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: You haven’t done that in a long time…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: What…?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: What you’re doing to my neck…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Was I doing something to your neck?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: It says here that some form of genetic damage
has apparently prevented the Son’a from procreating…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: No children?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: If that’s true, they’re a dying race.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: He started it.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: I didn’t do anything, I swear it.</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: Bridge to Commander Worf…</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: Worf?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Captain?</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: I don’t know how they do it on
Deep Space Nine… but on the Enterprise, we still report for duty on
time.</p>
<p><strong>worf’s com voice</strong>: I… I must have slept through my
alarm. I’m on my way…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We’ll skip the court martial this time…
Picard out.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: When was the last time we aligned our torque
sensors…</p>
<p><strong>perim</strong>: Two months ago, sir…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: They don’t sound right.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: The torque sensors are out of alignment…
by twelve microns… you could hear that?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: When I was an ensign, I could detect a
three-micron mis- alignment…</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: Excuse me, sir. The Son’a ship with Admiral
Dougherty aboard has entered tracking range…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Try to hail them.</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: Admiral Dougherty responding.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Straighten your baldric, Commander. On
screen…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Captain, I wasn’t expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: This was too important for the Enterprise to
be on the sidelines, Admiral…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: I wish I had better news. Commander Data
attacked us in the mission scout ship yesterday. Ru’afo and I have
decided to send in an assault team…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Sir, Commander Worf and I have been working
on several tactical plans to safely…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Your android has turned dangerously violent,
Captain… Considerable damage was done to my ship. He must be
destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: I know what Data means to Starfleet,
Jean-Luc… but our crew is at the mercy of those people on the
planet…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: If our first attempt to capture Data fails,
I will terminate him. I should be the one to do it. I’m his Captain. And
his friend.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: It isn’t safe for you to remain in this
area.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: He’s right. Our shields have been
upgraded to protect against the environmental anomalies…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We haven’t noticed any ill effects.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: All right. You have twelve hours,
Captain. Then I want you out of The Briar Patch. In the meantime, we’ll
be heading out to the perimeter to call for Son’a reinforcements in case
you fail.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Understood.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Good luck. Dougherty out.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Sensors are not picking up any ships coming
from the surface…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Transmit a wide band co-variant signal.
That’ll get his attention.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: He might be using the planet’s rings to mask
his approach.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: The metaphasic radiation in those rings is
in a state of extreme flux. Steer clear of them, Mister Worf…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Come out, come out wherever you are…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Hmm? Oh, it’s just something my mother used
to…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Open all hailing frequencies. Data, this is
Captain Picard…</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: … please acknowledge…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Sir, if we fire a tachyon burst, it may force
him to reset his shield harmonics. When he does, we could beam him
out…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Make it so.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Direct hit. He’s resetting his shield
harmonics…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Beam him out!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: He’s activated a transport inhibitor.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Prepare to enter the atmosphere… we’ll use
the ionospheric boundary to shake him…</p>
<p><strong>56 ext. space - upper atmosphere - scout/ shuttle -
56</strong>: DAY</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Scanners are off line!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Evasive maneuvers… heading one- four-zero
mark three-one…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: He can fly a ship, he anticipates tactical
strategies, his brain is obviously functioning… We’ve seen how he
responds to threats. I wonder how he’d respond to…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Do you know Gilbert and Sullivan?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: No, sir. I haven’t had a chance to meet all
the new crew members since I’ve been back…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: They’re composers, Worf, from the nineteenth
century. Data was rehearsing a part in H.M.S. Pinafore before he left…
“A British tar is a soaring soul, As free as a mountain bird, His
energetic first should be ready to resist A dictatorial word…”</p>
<p><strong>59 omitted 59</strong>: &amp; &amp; 60 60</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: “His nose should pant and his
lip should curl, His cheeks should flame and his brow should furl…”</p>
<p><strong>data/picard’s com voice</strong>: “His bosom should heave and
his heart should glow, and his fist be ready for a knock-down blow…”</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Sing!</p>
<p><strong>picard and worf</strong>: “His nose should pant and his lip
should curl, his cheeks should flame and his brow should furl…”</p>
<p><strong>data/picard/worf’s com voices</strong>: “… His bosom should
heave and his heart should glow… And his fist be ready for a knock-down
blow…”</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: He’s stopped firing.</p>
<p><strong>data’s com voice</strong>: “His eyes should flash with an
inborn fire, His brow should scorn be wrung; he never should bow down to
a domineering frown, Or the tang of a tyrant tongue…”</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Prepare the docking clamps.</p>
<p><strong>picard/ data’s com voice</strong>: “… His foot should
stamp…”</p>
<p><strong>data/picard’s com voice</strong>: “… and his throat should
growl, His hair should twirl and his face should scowl…”</p>
<p><strong>data/picard’s voices</strong>: “… His eyes should flash and
his breast protrude, And this should be his customary attitude –”</p>
<p><strong>data/picard’s voices</strong>: … His foot should stamp and
his throat should growl…”</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: “His hair should twirl and his
face should scowl…”</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Sir, inertial coupling is exceeding tolerance…
if we don’t release him, he may destroy both vessels…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m not letting go of him.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Warning. Impact with surface…</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: … in twenty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Reroute emergency power to inertial
dampers!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: The damping sequencer was damaged by phaser
fire!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Transferring controls to manual.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Warning. Impact with surface…</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: … in ten seconds.</p>

<p><strong>79 omitted 79</strong>: &amp; &amp; 80 80</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: Captain, Subahdar Gallatin, Son’a
Command.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Lieutenant Curtis, attach, to Admiral
Dougherty.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: We’ve been treated extremely well by
these people.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Counselor?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: They have an incredible clarity of perception,
Captain. I’ve never encountered a species with such mental
discipline…</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: My name is Sojef, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Jean-Luc Picard… my officers Doctor Crusher
and Counselor Troi.</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: Would you like something to eat?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: No, we’re here to… rescue them.</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: As you wish. But I would ask you to disarm
yourselves. This village is a sanctuary of life.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Prepare to transport the ‘hostages’ to the
ship…</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: They should be quarantined before joining
the ship’s population.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We were under the impression they were being
held against their will.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: It’s not our custom to have guests here at
all, let alone hold anyone against their will.</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: The artificial lifeform would not allow them
to leave. He told us they were our enemies and more would follow.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Are you our enemy?</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: Anij…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: My people have a strict policy of
non-interference with other cultures. In fact, it’s our Prime
Directive.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Your directive apparently doesn’t include
spying on other cultures.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: If I were in your shoes, I’d feel the same
way after what happened. The ‘artificial lifeform’ is a member of my
crew. Apparently, he became… ill…</p>
<p><strong>tournel</strong>: There did seem to be a phase variance in
the positronic matrix that we were unable to repair.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: I believe the Captain finds it hard to believe
that we’d have any skills repairing a positronic device…</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: Our technological abilities aren’t apparent
because we’ve chosen not to employ them in our daily lives. We believe
when you create a machine to do the work of a man, you take something
away from the man.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: But at one time, we explored the galaxy just
as you do…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You have warp capability?</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Capability, yes. But where can warp drive take
us, except away from here…?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I apologize for our intrusion.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: … and because they have warp capabilities,
the consequences to their society are minimal…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: You’ve done a terrific job, Jean- Luc.
Now, pack your bags and get the hell out of there. How’s Data?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: In stasis. La Forge is completing the
diagnostic.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: I’ll need all your paperwork tomorrow.
We’re heading back your way. Set a course to rendezvous with us so you
can transfer the crew and equipment on your way out.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You’re not finished here?</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Just a few loose ends to tie up.
Dougherty out.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Come in. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Got a minute? I… need a little counseling.
First time for everything. Do I… lie down… or what?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Whatever makes you comfortable…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: This isn’t one of the usual therapeutic
postures…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: But it’s comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Why don’t you try sitting up?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Or you could try lying down.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: You’re in quite a mood today.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Do you really need counseling or did you come
down here to play?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Both. I think I’m having a mid-life
crisis…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: … I believe you…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: … I’m not sleeping well…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: … Doctor Crusher has something that’ll take
care of that…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: What I need, I can’t get from Doctor Crusher…
Counselor, do you think it’s possible for two people to go back in time
to fix a mistake they’ve made?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: On this ship, anything can happen. And usually
does.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Augh.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Augh?</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: I never kissed you with a beard before.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: I kiss you and you say ‘augh’?!</p>
<p><strong>85 int. engineering corridor - moving with picard &amp;
85</strong>: LA FORGE</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: I took these out of Data’s neural net…
they contain memory engrams…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Do you know how they were damaged?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: By a Son’a weapon. There’s no doubt about
it, sir. That’s what made Data malfunction.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: The Son’a reports claim they didn’t fire
until after he malfunctioned.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: I don’t believe it happened that way.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Why would they fire at him without
provocation?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: All I know is that he was functioning
normally until he was shot. Then, his fail-safe system was
activated…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Fail-safe?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: His ethical and moral subroutines took
over all of his basic functions…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: So, you’re saying he still knew the
difference between right and wrong.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: In a sense, that’s all he knew. The system
is designed to protect him against anyone who might try to take
advantage of his memory loss.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: And yet he attacked us. And told the Ba’ku
we were a threat…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Implants bothering you?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: It’s nothing. I’m just tired.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Hello, Data…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Captain, Geordi…?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You’re aboard the Enterprise.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: You’ve had a serious malfunction.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I seem to be missing several memory
engrams…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Yes… that looks like them.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What’s the last thing you remember,
Data…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: ‘his nose should pant and his lip should
curl…’</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: From the mission…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I was in an isolation suit collecting
physiometric data on Ba’ku children. My last memory is going into the
hills, following a boy…</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: Artim, do you remember where you were on the
day of lightning when the artificial lifeform appeared to us?</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: In the hills, by the dam.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Can you show us?</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Haven’t you disrupted our lives enough…?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I understand how you feel. We just want to
retrace Data’s movements that day…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I don’t like to leave questions
unanswered.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Then you must spend your life answering
questions.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: There is no need for concern. I am operating
within normal parameters now.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: You’re what?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I am better.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I believe the boy is… afraid… of me.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It’s nothing personal data. You have to
remember these people have rejected technology. And you…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: … I am the personification of everything they
have rejected.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Until this week, that young man probably
never saw a machine, let alone one that walks and talks…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: And I do not believe I made a very good first
impression.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: I saw the first bolt of lightning over
there…</p>
<p><strong>worf’s com voice</strong>: Bridge to Riker.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Can I get back to you, Worf?</p>
<p><strong>worf’s com voice</strong>: Admiral Dougherty’s on the com-
link, sir.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Patch him through. Yes, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Why haven’t you left orbit yet?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Captain Picard is still on the surface,
sir.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Doing what?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: He didn’t want to leave until we could
adequately explain why Data malfunctioned. His future in Starfleet could
depend on it.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Remind the captain his twelve hours are
up.</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Dougherty out.</p>
<p><strong>son’a doctor</strong>: Your body is producing far too many
toxins… we’ve reached the limit of genetic manipulation…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: I won’t need any more genetic manipulation
if our Federation friends will allow us to complete this mission.</p>
<p><strong>95 ext. planet surface - day - looking down to see a small
95</strong>: LAKE</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Tricorder functions are limited due to heavy
deposits of kelbonite in these hills…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How about a passive radiation scan?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Curious, there appear to be strong neutrino
emissions coming from the lake…</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Can he breathe under water?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Data doesn’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Won’t he rust?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Sir, I believe I know what is causing the
neutrino emissions…</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Are there other machines like him in the
offland?</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: The offland is no concern of yours.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: A ship,</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: It is clearly Federation in origin,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: ‘Just a few loose ends to tie up.’</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: We’re not interested in such things.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It might be wiser for you to stay on
shore.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: It is a holographic projection.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Incomplete, I might add.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What you’re seeing is a computer driven
image created by photons and forcefields…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: I know what a hologram is, Captain. The
question is – why would someone want to create one of our village?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Data, if you were following the boy and
discovered this ship…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: … it is conceivable I was shot to protect the
secret of its existence.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What possible purpose could a duplicate
village have except… to deceive the Ba’ku…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Deceive us?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: To move you off this planet. You go to sleep
one night in your village… wake up the next morning in this flying
holodeck transported en masse. A week later, maybe a month, you’ve been
relocated on a similar planet without ever realizing it.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Why would the Federation or the Son’a wish to
move the Ba’ku?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Computer, end program and decloak the
vessel.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: I can’t swim!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Don’t panic…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: I’ve been shot at… thrown into the lake out of
an invisible ship that’s come to abduct us all… what’s there to panic
about?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: In the event of a water landing, I have been
designed to serve as a floatation device.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Did any of the hostages mention a cloaked
ship during their debriefings?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: No, sir…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Debrief them again. Have you been in a
fight, Commander?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: No, sir. It is a gorch.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Gorch?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Oh… well, it’s hardly… noticeable…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Smooth as an android’s bottom, eh, Data?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I… beg your pardon, sir?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Admiral Dougherty wants to know why we
haven’t left yet…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Deck five.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: You Klingons never do anything small, do
you…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Doctor Crusher asked to talk to you when you
returned…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Picard to Crusher…</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Captain, the Son’a hostages declined to be
examined. I had them confined to quarters.</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: And our people?</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: They all have slightly elevated levels of
endorphin production… probably the result of the environmental anomalies
here…</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: Are they in any danger?</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Not at all. They’re fine… in fact, they’re
better than fine. Increased metabolism, high energy, improved muscle
tone. We should all be so lucky.</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: Very good, Doctor. Picard
out.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: The Son’a officers are not to be released
until I’ve met with Ahdar Ru’afo.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: No, sir. It is not. As smooth as an android’s
bottom.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Computer, music.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: No. Not that. Something else. Something…
Latin.</p>
<p><strong>computer voice</strong>: Please specify.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: A mambo. That’s more like it…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How old are you?</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: We came here from a solar system on the verge
of self- annihilation… where technology had created weapons that
threatened to destroy all life. A small group of us set off to find a
new home… a home that would be isolated from the threats of other
worlds. That was three hundred and nine years ago.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You’ve not aged a day since then?</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: Actually, I was a good deal older when we
arrived… in terms of my physical condition.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: There’s an unusual metaphasic radiation coming
from the planet’s rings. It continuously regenerates the cells in our
bodies. You must have noticed the effects by now.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We’ve… just begun to. I suppose you’re
seventy-five.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: No. I’m twelve.</p>
<p><strong>tournel</strong>: The metaphasic radiation won’t begin to
affect him until he reaches maturity…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: To many offlanders, what you have here would
be more valuable than gold-pressed latinum. And I’m afraid it’s the
reason that someone is trying to take this world away from you.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: The artificial lifeform was right?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: If not for Data, you’d probably have been
re-located by now.</p>
<p><strong>tournel</strong>: How can we possibly defend ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: The moment we pick up a weapon, we become one
of them… we lose everything we are…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It may not come to that.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Clearly, the architects of this conspiracy
have tried to keep it a secret. Not just from you, but from my people as
well. I don’t intend to let them.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: We’ve always known that to survive, we had to
remain apart. It hasn’t been easy. Many of the young people here want to
know more about the offland… they’re attracted to stories of a faster
pace of life…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Most of my people who live that faster pace
would sell their souls to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: But not you.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There are days.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: You don’t live up to your reputation as an
offlander, Picard.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: In defense of offlanders, there are many
more like me…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: … who wouldn’t be tempted by the promise of
perpetual youth? I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You give me more credit than I deserve. Of
course, I’m tempted. Who wouldn’t be? But some of the blackest marks in
the history of my world have involved the forced relocation of a small
group of people to satisfy the demands of a larger one. I’d like to
believe we learn from our mistakes. Obviously, some of us haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: The craftsmanship is extraordinary.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: This is a school… that’s a student’s work.
She’ll be ready to become an apprentice soon. Then, in thirty or forty
years, she’ll take her place among the artisans…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: An apprentice for thirty years. We’ve
noticed your people’s mental discipline. Did that develop here?</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: More questions. Always the explorer. If you
stay long enough, that’ll change.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Will it?</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: You’ll stop reviewing what happened yesterday…
stop planning for tomorrow… until you find… Let me ask you a question –
have you ever experienced a perfect moment in time?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: A perfect moment?</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: When time seemed to stop… and you could almost
live in that moment…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Seeing my home planet from space for the
first time…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Yes. Exactly. Nothing more complicated than
perception. You explore the universe. We’ve discovered a single moment
in time can be a universe in itself… full of powerful forces… most
people aren’t aware enough of the now… to ever notice them…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I wish I could spare a few centuries to
learn.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: It took us centuries to learn that it doesn’t
have to take centuries to learn.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There’s one thing I don’t understand. In
three hundred years…you never learned to swim?</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: I just… haven’t gotten around to it yet.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: I wonder if you’re aware of the trust you
endanger, Jean-Luc Picard. In my experience, it’s unusual for…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: … an offlander?</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: For someone so young.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Geordi…?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: Funniest thing, Captain. There wasn’t
anything wrong with my implants. There was something right with my eyes.
When Doctor Crusher removed the ocular connections, she found the cells
around my optic nerves…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: … had regenerated.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: It may not last after we leave. If not, I
just wanted, before we go… I’ve never actually seen a sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Am I to understand you’re not releasing my
men, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I found the holoship.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Ru’afo, why don’t you let the Captain and
I…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: This entire mission has been one Federation
blunder after another. You will return my men or this alliance will end
with the destruction of your ship.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: You’re looking well, Jean-Luc.
Rested.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Your “Briar Patch” turned out to be more
hospitable than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: That’s why we put chromodynamic shields
in place - so our people wouldn’t feel the effects from the metaphasic
radiation…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: … or understand that they were participating
in the outright theft of a world. I won’t let you move them, Admiral.
I’ll go to the Federation Council…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: I’m acting on orders form the Federation
Council.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How can there be an order to abandon the
Prime Directive…?</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: The Prime Directive doesn’t apply. These
people are not indigenous to this world. They were never meant to be
immortal. We’ll simply be restoring their natural evolution.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Who are we to decide the next course of
evolution for these people?</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: There are six hundred people down there.
We’ll be able to use the regenerative properties of this radiation to
help billions. The Son’a have developed a procedure to collect the
metaphasic particles form the planets rings…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: A planet in Federation space…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Right. We have the planet and they have
the technology – a technology we can’t duplicate. You know what that
makes us? Their partners.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Our partners are nothing more than petty
thugs.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: On Earth, petroleum once turned petty
thugs into world leaders. Warp drive transformed a bunch of Romulan
thugs into an empire. We can handle the Son’a, I’m not worried about
that…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Someone probably said the same thing about
the Romulans a century ago.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: With metaphasics, lifespans will be
doubled… an entire new medical science will evolve… I understand your
Chief Engineer has the use of his eyes for the first time in his life…
would you take his sight away from him?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There are metaphasic particles all over The
Briar Patch. Why must this planet be…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: The concentration in the rings is what
makes the whole damned thing work. Don’t ask me to explain it. I only
know they inject something into the rings that starts a thermolytic
reaction. After it’s over, the planet will be unlivable for
generations.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Delay the procedure. Let my people look at
the technology.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Our best scientific minds already have.
We can’t find any other way to do this.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Then the Son’a can establish a separate
colony on this planet until we do…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: It would take ten years of normal
exposure to begin to reverse their condition. Some of them won’t survive
that long. Besides, they don’t want to live in the middle of The Briar
Patch… who would?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: The Ba’ku.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We are betraying the principles upon which
the Federation was founded… this is an attack on the very soul of the
Federation. This will destroy the Ba’ku. Just as cultures have been
destroyed in every other forced relocation throughout history.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: We are only moving six hundred people,
Jean-Luc.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How many people would it take… before it
becomes wrong? A thousand? Fifty thousand. A million?</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: I’m ordering you to the Goren system.
File whatever protests you wish to. By the time you do, this will be all
done. I’m also ordering the release of the Son’a officers.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Prepare the ship for departure at
oh-seven-hundred hours.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Aye, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Gallatin! So the righteous Starfleet Captain
finally released you. Did you encounter any problems on the surface?</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: No, sir. But it wasn’t easy… being among
them…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: I’m sure. Just don’t forget what they did to
us. We’ll have them rounded up in a day or two… we needn’t bother with
the Federation holo-ship any more. Just get the holding cells ready.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: I’m going to miss these little
flesh-stretching sessions of ours, my dear.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Re-routing the transport grid to avoid
detection was wise, sir, but the transporter is rarely used after
oh-two-hundred hours.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Taking the Captain’s yacht out for a spin?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Seven metric tons of ultritium explosives,
eight tetryon pulse launchers, ten isomagnetic disintegrators…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: You must be planning on doing some
hunting.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Go back to your quarters That’s an
order.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: No uniform? No orders.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: How could I look at another sunrise,
knowing what my sight cost these people, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I feel obliged to point out that the
environmental anomalies may be stimulating certain rebellious instincts
common to youth that could affect everyone’s judgment. Except mine, of
course.</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Okay, Data, what do you think we should
do?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Saddle up. Lock and load.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: They won’t begin the procedure while the
planet is inhabited. So, our job is to keep the planet inhabited.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Go back and put a face on what’s happening
here. Make the Council see the Ba’ku. It’s too easy to turn a blind eye
to the suffering of an unfamiliar people.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There’s a short letter I left you all, just
some… sentimental nonsense… the computer will bring it to your attention
at oh- four-hundred… I’d just as soon you delete it…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Fat chance. I’ll post it on every monitor on
the ship…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We’ll hold out as long as we can.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Apparently the environmental anomalies are
also stimulating…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: The injector performs perfectly in every
simulation…</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: Sir, as the Enterprise left orbit, one of
their support craft went down to the surface. It appeared to be the
Captain’s Yacht. Five persons on board.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: We’re not waiting until morning… take the
shuttles and get everyone off the surface tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Gallatin, if Picard or any of his people
interfere… eliminate them.</p>
<p><strong>various ba’ku</strong>: What is it? What’s going on? What’s
happened? Is something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>tournel</strong>: We’re leaving the village… take only what
you need. Bring food… we may not be back for days…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: It is a transport inhibitor. It will help
prevent Son’a ships from beaming anyone off the surface…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: … these are the veins of kelbonite running
through the hills… the more concentrated the deposits the more trouble
they’ll have with their transporters… our route will keep us close to
these deposits as possible…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: When we’re forced away by the terrain, we’ll
use transport inhibitors to compensate. The mountains have the highest
concentrations. Once we’re there, transport will be virtually
impossible…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: There are caves in those mountains.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We can hold them off a long time… once we
get there… But they will not make it easy to get there…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Captain, I’ve activated transport inhibitors
around the village…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Good. Let’s begin to move these people
out…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Should I distribute phasers to the Ba’ku,
sir…?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: No. We’ll be responsible for that, Mister
Worf.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #1</strong>: Transporters are not
functioning.</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: They’re blocking the beams with some kind
of inhibitors. We’ll have to locate and destroy them.</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: Don’t try to carry too much… we’ve got a long
climb ahead of us…</p>
<p><strong>143 omitted 143</strong>: &amp; &amp; 144 144</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: We’ve lost an inhibitor! There’s a gap in the
field…</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: My father!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Stay in the protected areas… we’ll be safe
when we get into the hills…</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: They’re following the kelbonite deposits…
using the interference to block our transporters…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Recommendations?</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Take me down. Let me talk to Picard.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Talk… we should send down an assault team
and take them by force.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: That is not an acceptable option. If
people get hurt, all the support we have in the Federation…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Federation support, Federation procedures,
Federation rules… look in the mirror, Admiral… the Federation is old… in
the last twenty four months, it’s been challenged by every major power
in the quadrant – the Borg, the Cardassians, the Dominion… they all
smell the scent of death on the Federation. That’s why you’ve embraced
our offer… because it will give your dear Federation new life. Well, how
badly do you want it, Admiral? Because there are hard choices to be made
now. If the Enterprise gets through with news about their brave
Captain’s valiant struggle on behalf of the defenseless Ba’ku, your
Federation politicians will waver, your Federation opinion polls will
open a public debate, your Federation allies will want their say… need I
go on?</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: There is an alternative to an all- out
assault. Isolinear tags would allow our transporters to lock on to
them.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: We’d have to tag every one of them… that
would take time… and we don’t have it. The Enterprise is only nineteen
hours from communications range with the Federation…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: I’ll order Riker to turn around.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Picard’s first officer. Do you really
believe he’ll listen?</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: My ships are capable of intercepting the
Enterprise before it reaches the perimeter. I could send them to…
escort… it back… but Commander Riker might not want to come…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Send your ships.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: My father told me I shouldn’t talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I understand.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Not everyone here agrees with him. I mean,
you know, about machines. There was even a big fight about it once. Do
you like being a machine?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I aspire to be more than I am.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: I know why. So people like us won’t be afraid
of you any more.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Perhaps, that is true.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Don’t you ever get tired?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: My power cells continually re- charge
themselves.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: I can’t imagine what it would be like to be a
machine.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Perhaps it would surprise you to know that I
have often tried to imagine what it would be like to be a child…</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: For one thing, your legs are shorter than
everyone else’s.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: But they are in a constant state of growth. Do
you find it difficult to adapt? A child’s specifications are never the
same from one moment to the next. I am surprised that you do not… trip
over your own feet.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Sometimes I do.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: My legs are eighty-seven-point- two
centimeters. They were eighty-seven-point-two centimeters the day I was
created. They will be eighty- seven-point-two centimeters the day I go
off line. My operation depends on specifications that do not change. I…
cannot imagine… the experience of growing up or even tripping over my
own feet…</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: But you’ve never had adults telling you what
to do all the time… or bedtimes… or having to eat food you don’t
like…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I would gladly accept the requirement of a
bedtime in exchange for knowing what it is like to be a child.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Do machines ever play?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I play the violin… and my chess routines are
quite advanced…</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: No, I mean…</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: You’re it.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I’m what?</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Chase me!</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: For what purpose?</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Because you’re it. And if you tag me… then
I’m it.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: But I can run much faster than you… I am
capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second…</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Data… haven’t you ever just played… for
fun?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Androids… don’t have…fun.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Why not…?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: No one’s ever asked me that before.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: If you want to know ‘what it’s like to be a
child’, you need to learn how to play…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You need a haircut, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Accelerated hair growth is often experienced
by Klingons during Jak’tahla…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Jak’tahla?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Roughly translated: puberty… although for a
Klingon that’s not doing it justice… Any severe mood swings, unusual
aggressive tendencies – be sure to let me know right away…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: The Ba’ku could use some rest, sir. According
to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few
kilometers…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Very well. We’ll take an hour. Break out
some rations…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Right beyond that ridge is where the caves
begin… we can hide for days…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: By now the Son’a have scanned the area and
know that just as well as we do.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: It’s been three hundred years since I’ve seen
a bald man.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How is it a woman like you never married?
And don’t tell me you “just haven’t gotten around to it yet”…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: What’s the rush?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I should warn you… I’ve always been
attracted to older women…</p>
<p><strong>perim</strong>: Commander, I’m showing two Son’a ships on an
intercept course.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: How long ’til they reach us?</p>
<p><strong>perim</strong>: Eighteen minutes…</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: We’re not going to be able to get a
transmission out of here for at least another hour…</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: They’re hailing us.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Tell them our transceiver assembly is down,
that we can send messages but can’t receive them.</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: I don’t think they believe us.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: A photon torpedo. Isn’t that the universal
greeting when communications are down?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: I think it’s the universal greeting when
you don’t like someone.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Full impulse.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: The manifold can’t handle full impulse in
the Patch, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: If we don’t outrun them, the manifolds are
going to be the only thing left of this ship.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: I’ll be in Engineering.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: All hands. Battle stations!</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: And have you noticed how your boobs have
started to firm up?</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Not that we care about such things in this
day and age.</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Thank you, Data.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: I have an odd craving for the blood of a live
Kolar beast. The environment must be affecting me again.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: And have you noticed how your boobs have
started to firm up? Not that we care about such things in this day and
age.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Take cover!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Isolinear tags. Their transporters can lock
onto them.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: We have to find shelter…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: There’s a cavern at the base of the next
hill…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>172 various - (optical) 172</strong>: THRU THRU 175 175</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: A dangerous variation on your game of ‘tag’,
Artim. Hurry we most definitely do not want to be ‘it’…</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: Shields at sixty percent… !</p>
<p><strong>la forge’s com voice</strong>: Engineering to Bridge. We’re
burning deuterium down here…</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: We’re going to blow ourselves up… we won’t
need any help from the Son’a…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: What’s inside that nebula cluster?</p>
<p><strong>perim</strong>: Cometary debris, pockets of unstable metreon
gas… we don’t want to go in there, sir…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Yes, we do. You’re relieved, Ensign. Take
over at Ops.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Time to use “The Briar Patch” like B’rer
Rabbit did…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Into the cavern! Move!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Definitely feeling aggressive tendencies…</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: Sir, they’ve detonated an isolytic burst… a
subspace tear is forming…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: On screen.</p>
<p><strong>perim</strong>: I thought subspace weapons were banned by the
Khitomer Accord…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Remind me to lodge a protest…</p>
<p><strong>la forge’s com voice</strong>: Commander, our warp core is
acting like a magnet to the tear.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: We’re pulling it like a zipper across
space…</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: Options?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: Eject the core.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Will that stop the tear?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: You got me, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: That’s your expert opinion?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: Detonating the warp core might neutralize
the cascade… but then again it might not. Subspace weapons are
unpredictable. That’s why they were banned.</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: The tear is closing on us… impact in fifteen
seconds…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Eject the core.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: I just did.</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: Impact in ten seconds…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Detonate!</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: It worked, Commander… the tear’s been
sealed…</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: There’s nothing to stop them from doing it
again… and we’re fresh out of warp cores…</p>
<p><strong>perim</strong>: We’re still thirty-six minutes from
transmission range, sir.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: We’re through running from these
bastards.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Another forty-three people reported taken,
sir…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: They’re trying to force us out so their drones
can tag us…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: With all the hydrothermal vents in the
substrata, the structural integrity of this cavern is not going to hold
for long, Captain…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Is there any other way out of here?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Tracking the water flow may reveal another
potential exit…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I’m showing fresh air behind this calcite
formation, Captain…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Will the structure hold if we blast
through?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I believe it is safe, sir.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Spread out as far as you can… get everyone
into those caves, set up forcefields once you’re inside…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Geordi, are those pockets of metreon
gas…?</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: Aye, sir. Highly volatile…I recommend we
keep our distance…</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: Negative. I want to use the
ramscoop to collect as much of it as we can…</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: The purpose being…?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: The purpose being I intend to shove it down
the Son’a’s throat.</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: Commander, if one of their weapons hits that
gas…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: It’s our only way out of here, Mister
Nara.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: I wouldn’t be surprised if history
remembers this as the Riker Maneuver…</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: If it works you mean.</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: Even if it doesn’t, they’ll be teaching
kids as the Academy not to do this for years to come.</p>
<p><strong>la forge’s com voice</strong>: Bridge, storage cells are at
maximum capacity – five thousand cubic meters of metreon gas…</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Computer, access manual steering column.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Transfer helm controls to manual.</p>
<p><strong>perim</strong>: They’re powering their forward weapons
array.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Blow out the ramscoop. Stand by full
thrusters.</p>
<p><strong>la forge’s com voice</strong>: Ramscoop released!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Up there!</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Data, Troi… keep these people moving. Worf,
with me…</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Captain…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Will he live?</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Yes. But look at this medscan…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: How could this be possible?</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Maybe we should ask them.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Is that everyone?</p>
<p><strong>ba’ku woman</strong>: The boy…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Wait here.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Artim! What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>tournel</strong>: Anij went to find Artim…</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: I’ve got him.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Anij!</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Tournel will take you the rest of the way…</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: No… I want to stay with you…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: It is safer there. I will join you
shortly.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Worf to Picard.</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Two life signs… one extremely faint…</p>
<p><strong>troi</strong>: There are almost four metric tons of rock
blocking our way…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: That might cause another cave-in.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Anij…</p>
<p><strong>worf’s com voice</strong>: Worf to Picard…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Yes… yes, I… can hear you…</p>
<p><strong>worf’s com voice</strong>: We’re trying to get to you,
sir…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Anij.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Help is coming.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Worf, you must hurry…</p>
<p><strong>worf’s com voice</strong>: We’re coming as fast as we can… we
can’t risk using phasers…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I understand. Tell Doctor Crusher to have a
hypospray of lectrazine ready…</p>
<p><strong>crusher’s com voice</strong>: How bad is she, Captain…?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m losing her.</p>
<p><strong>crusher’s com voice</strong>: We’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Stay with me… don’t let go of this moment,
Anij… help me find the power to make you live in this moment… just one
more moment… and then one more after that… and one more after that.</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: She’s stabilizing.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Is it safe to move her?</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Safer than leaving her here.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: And you thought it would take centuries to
learn.</p>
<p><strong>235 various - (optical) 235</strong>: THRU THRU 238 238</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: Order them to surrender, and I promise
you won’t be court- martialed.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: If a court-martial is the only way to tell
the people of the Federation what happened here, then I welcome it.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: The Enterprise has destroyed one of my
ships. The other is on fire, requesting assistance.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: The Enterprise would only fire if it were
defending itself. Ru’afo must have ordered the attack. I can’t believe
he would’ve given that order without your consent, Admiral.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I wonder… which one of us will be facing
that court-martial…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: There’s nothing further to be gained from
this…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: You’re right. This is going to end now. The
Ba’ku want to stay on the planet. Let them. I’m going to launch the
injector…</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: You’re not going to launch anything
until…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: In six hours, every living thing in this
system will be dead or dying.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You would kill your own people, Ru’afo? Your
own parents, your brothers, sisters… Didn’t you know, Admiral? The Ba’ku
and the Son’a are the same race.</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: Which one were you? Gal’na…
Ro’tin…Belath’nin… I’m sorry, I don’t recognize you…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Those names, those children are gone
forever.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: What is he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: A century ago, a group of our young people
wanted to follow the ways of the offlanders. They tried to take over the
colony… and when they failed…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: When we failed, you exiled us. To die
slowly.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: You’re Ro’tin, aren’t you…? There’s something
in the voice. Would you be his friend Gal’na? I helped your mother bathe
you when you were a child. She still speaks of you.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: You’ve brought the Federation into the
middle of a blood feud, Admiral. The children have returned to expel
their elders… just as they were once expelled. Except Ru’afo’s need for
revenge has now escalated to parricide.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: It was for the Federation. It was all for
the Federation.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: We’re taking this ship out of here… this
mission is over…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: It is not over.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: It is over.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: I do not take orders from you.</p>
<p><strong>dougherty</strong>: If you begin the procedure while the
planet is still populated, the Federation will pursue you until…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: The Federation…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: … will never know what happened here.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Admiral Dougherty will not be joining us for
diner. Deploy the collector. Do you have a problem with those
orders?</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: May I talk to you alone?</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Deploy the collector.</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: Moving them is one thing. Killing them
all…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: No one hated them more than you, Gal’na.
We’ve come a long way together. This is the moment we’ve planned for so
many years…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Separate the Starfleet personnel and secure
them in the aft cargo hold… see that Picard joins them…</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: The shields in that section won’t protect
them against the thermolytic reaction…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Thank-you for reminding me.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Jean-Luc…</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: It must have been very strange for you. When
you were a hostage. Being among the friends and families you knew so
many years ago. All of them looking exactly as they did. Almost like…
looking through the eyes of childhood again.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: And here you are trying to close those eyes
again… to pretend you can’t see what the bitterness has done to your
people… what it’s done to Ru’afo… and to you It’s turned you… into a
coward. A man who ignores his conscience.</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: A coward… without the moral courage to stop
an unspeakable atrocity. You offend me.</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: Is this how a Federation officer begs for
his life?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m not begging for my life. I’m begging for
yours. There is still a way home, Gal’na.</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: Computer, close turbolift doors.</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: What you’re asking me to do… is
impossible… the crew is loyal to Ru’afo…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Do you know how to disable the injector?</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: But I would need at least three minutes on
the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: If we could lure him away from the
bridge…</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: It doesn’t matter where he is. As soon as
he realizes something is happening, he’ll override my commands with one
word at his com- link…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: What if he doesn’t realize something’s
happening… Can you get me to a transmitter? I have to speak with Worf
and Data on the surface… we’ll need their help…</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: Deck twelve.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Initiate launch sequence.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #2</strong>: Activating injector assembly.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #3</strong>: Launch in minutes.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #3</strong>: A small craft is coming up from
the surface. It’s firing tachyon bursts at us…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: On screen.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #3</strong>: One person aboard. It’s the
android.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: He’s no threat.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Data to Picard…</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: Yes, Data…</p>
<p><strong>data’s com voice</strong>: Sir, they’re ignoring my
attack.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Keep firing tachyon bursts into their shield
grid. Is Worf in position…?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Yes, sir. He’s ready for simultaneous
transport.</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: We’ll be at the bridge in two
minutes… Picard out…</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #3</strong>: Detonation in three minutes.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #2</strong>: Sir, the Federation ship is
creating a disruption in our shields… if they go out of phase, it will
increase our exposure to the thermolytic reaction…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Very well. Destroy that ship and reset our
shield harmonics… do not delay the countdown…</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Data to Picard. They are rotating the shield
harmonics. I am attempting to return to the surface…</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #3</strong>: The Federation ship has been
disabled.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #2</strong>: Launch in thirty seconds.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #3</strong>: I don’t know. Systems don’t seem
affected…</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #2</strong>: Launch in fifteen seconds.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #2</strong>: Ten seconds.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #2</strong>: Injector assembly launched.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Exactly as the simulations predicted…</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #2</strong>: Sir, I am not showing any change
in metaphasic flux levels…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Your scanners must be malfunctioning.</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #2</strong>: All ship functions are
off-line.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: How can there be no ship functions if the
viewscreen is working, artificial gravity is stable, life support
is…</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: A holodeck?</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: A holodeck?</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: We were transported to the holo- ship when
we reset our shields. Everything we saw… was an illusion. Ru’afo,
authorization delta two- one… override all interlink commands to
injector assembly one.</p>
<p><strong>son’a computer</strong>: Unable to comply. Injector assembly
one has been de- activated.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: All injector sub-systems are confirmed
off-line.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Decloak the holo-ship and engage a tractor
beam, Mister Worf.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Picard to Data.</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: Your status?</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Precarious, sir… I am having trouble
re-entering the atmosphere… I believe I will have to transport to the
surface…</p>
<p><strong>picard’s com voice</strong>: Understood. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Thank-you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: This ship is equipped with fourteen long
range transporters… are they all useless…?</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #2</strong>: They must have been locked and
secured after we were beamed here.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: Isolate one and re-route its command
sequence through the auxiliary processor…</p>
<p><strong>son’a officer #3</strong>: Sir, there’s nothing we can do…
they already have control of our ship.</p>
<p><strong>ru’afo</strong>: I don’t plan on going back to our ship.</p>
<p><strong>nara</strong>: Sir, we’re within sensor range of the Son’a
ship. I’m picking up Captain Picard’s com-signal on board…</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: Enterprise to Picard…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Number one.</p>
<p><strong>riker’s com voice</strong>: We should be at your position in
seven minutes. Do you need assistance…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Negative. Did you succeed?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: The Council has ordered a halt to the Ba’ku
relocation while they conduct a top-level review.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Top level review, my ass. There’ll be no
cover-up of this. Not after I get…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Captain…</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: The countdown control has been transferred
to the collector…I can’t override…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Scan for lifesigns.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: One. It’s Ru’afo.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Can you beam him off?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Negative. He’s established a security field
around the control room…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Is there any other way to disable the
injector?</p>
<p><strong>275 angle (optical) - computer display showing the
275</strong>: INJECTOR ASSEMBLY</p>
<p><strong>gallatin</strong>: We’d have to remove the ignition matrix
directly from the injector assembly… but in less than two minutes, that
injector is going to be launched into the rings…</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Sir, I volunteer to…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Denied, Commander. I have no intention of
informing your bride that you’re not coming home…</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Looking for this?</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Have I mentioned the unanticipated rewards
I’ve discovered in a permanent relationship…?</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: ‘Permanent’… that sounds like a long time,
Worf.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Life is short, Commander.</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: I wish there was a way to bring them back
home.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Ask them.</p>
<p><strong>sojef</strong>: I’m afraid there’s too much bitterness… on
both sides.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Mother and son. You arranged this…?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I thought it might begin the healing
process.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: What am I going to do without you?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: These are perilous times for the Federation.
I can’t abandon it to people who would threaten everything I’ve spent a
lifetime defending.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: I’m going back to Earth to… slow things
down… at the Federation Council.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: But I have three hundred and eighteen days
of vacation time coming. I plan on using them.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: I’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Captain, the Ticonderoga has moved into
orbit.</p>
<p><strong>quark’s voice</strong>: Worf!</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: What are you doing here, Quark?</p>
<p><strong>quark</strong>: The same thing everyone else in the quadrant
is going to be doing here… as soon as I build the greatest spa in the
galaxy… … these people don’t have any religious thing about casinos do
they…?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: There aren’t going to be any spas on this
planet.</p>
<p><strong>quark</strong>: Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: This world is about to become a Federation
protectorate, which will end any and all attempts at exploitation by
people like you.</p>
<p><strong>quark</strong>: Explain to me how five thousand time-share
units… right there along the lake… would be ‘exploiting’ anyone.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Mister Worf, have this uninvited… offlander
and his quests beamed to the Enterprise. We’ll deposit them at Deep
Space Nine.</p>
<p><strong>worf</strong>: Must you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>quark</strong>: You’ll hear from my Nagus.</p>
<p><strong>anij</strong>: Do you really think your mighty Federation
would be interested in protecting six hundred people?</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: The “mighty” Federation could learn a few
things from this village…</p>
<p><strong>la forge</strong>: Where’s Data?</p>
<p><strong>crusher</strong>: Data! It’s time to go!</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: I have to go home now.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>data</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>artim</strong>: Don’t forget – you’ve got to play a little
bit every day.</p>
<p><strong>riker</strong>: Good advice.</p>
<p><strong>picard</strong>: Enterprise… seven to beam up. Energize.</p>
