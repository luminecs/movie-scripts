again.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Come on, hit me.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Chill…I gotta find – alright.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You got one?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: “Warning Shots”, Thievery Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Come on. Next one.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: “Bullets” by the Editors.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You loaded these songs. You don’t need to be
so impressed with yourself.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I know I don’t have to be.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I haven’t even heard of half these
bands.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s called good music. You should try to
familiarize yourself with it, instead of listening to the crap you
do.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I listen to crap?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hurts me to be the one to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I’m sure it does.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You gotta be more like me, baby. Think new,
fresh, cutting edge. I’m looking for the next Beatles, U2 or
Radiohead.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: So, where does this band fall into that
group?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Fresh, new or cutting edge?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How’d that get on there?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You loaded the songs. You tell me?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Must be a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Says here you’ve listened to it 86
times.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Is this true? Have you always wanted to be a
cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You also got “Men Without Hats” greatest
hits? I didn’t know they qualified for a greatest hits album. Can you
break me off a little “Safety Dance”?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Okay, give me that.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Now what can I do you two for?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Well…ah…</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: First time here and you’re not quite sure where
to begin.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Precisely like that.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Get you started with one of these.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: How long you folks hiking for?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Two days. Heading out early Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Well, if you move at a decent clip, you could
hit the summit by midday tomorrow. Should still give you time to take it
all in and make it down.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Any particular path?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You folks experienced hikers?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’ve done some ah–</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: No. Nothing like this.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: For first-timers, I recommend either Willow
Creek Bridge or Donner Trail.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Donner Trail? As in “The Donner Party?”</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: I’m not sure of the name’s origin. They’re the
two paths we regularly patrol. Something happens and you’re on one of
the other trails, it might be awhile before we find you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Where do we camp?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Unless it says not to, you can set up where you
like. Just make sure when you turn in that you extinguish your fire. Oh,
and this here’s bear country. They’re not animals to fool with. You see
one, you head the other way, especially if he’s feeding. If the bear
thinks you’re getting in the way of his food, that’s all she wrote.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: You got yourself a first aid kit?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Nurse Betty here’s my first aid kit.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Don’t mind him. I’m a nurse.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Good for you. The question was, do you have a
first aid kit?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Yes, we have a first aid kit.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Great, see how easy that was. It’s off-season,
park’s pretty quiet. Even more than usual. You may run into a few
locals, but–</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: People live up here?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: We have a few generations of families that have
called these mountains home. Most of `em are friendly. Respect their
land and they’ll respect you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Base is just outside, to the left. At about two
miles up there’ll be a junction where you can pick your path.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You getting anything?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’ll lock them in the car.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I’ll take mine.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Just to annoy you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Seriously…</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: In an emergency, I’d rather have a phone
that may not work up there, than not have a phone that may work up
there.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Okay, we all set?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Let’s do this.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Hey, Einstein. What do you think, leave the
tent or maybe take it with us?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I was just seeing if you were paying
attention.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: It could be fun.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Not a chance. High School reunions serve only
two purposes… to try to</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: So what were you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Me? I was a stoner.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: So what does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How the hell am I supposed to remember? I was
high all the time.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Where’d you get that bandana?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: It’s cute, right? I stopped by that
Army-Navy store on Grover yesterday. Keeps the sweat out of your
eyes.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: And when you were buying it, you didn’t think
that maybe…</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Oh…well…it was the last one…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: The last one?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: The entire Army-Navy store… sold out?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Completely. There was some sort of run on
bandanas at the last minute.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Here… You big baby.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Fucking nasty.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Looks like it’s a, or was, a fox. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What do you think? “Cannibal” Trail or the
other one?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Guidebook says a couple of these other trails
lead to some pretty sweet views.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: We’re not Lewis and/or Clark. We’re gonna
stick to one of the ones the Ranger said.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You folks need some help?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’re just going over our options here.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Well, take it from me, any way you choose, you
can’t go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: The Ranger at base suggested Donner Trail
or…</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: …Willow Creek Bridge. I think Sam only knows
those two trails. Well. Between those, I’d pick Donner Trail. Willow
Creek will shoot you to the top, but there’s not as much to see. Donner
weaves through Peddler’s Point, it’s a better hike and prettier all
around view.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: That’s a pretty ring.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Not your traditional wedding ring, but it’s all
the same in the Lord’s eyes. How long have you two been wed?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Oh… we’re not married. Not yet anyway.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: It’s a ring my father gave me for
graduation.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. You just looked like you was
married is’all. Both so beautiful. I’m just an old fashioned silly-bird.
I need to mind my own business.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: No, it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Which one of those trails got the best
clearings?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Clearings? Neither will give you much in the
way of clearings. But, there’s another path, this one here. Timber
Falls. Its got some beautiful vistas and one of the prettiest falls
you’ll ever see.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sounds perfect. Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Well, I’ll leave you to it. Last thing you need
is me fussing’round you, taking you from your private time.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl mike</strong>: Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the
tip.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’m just gonna say it and go, but if you two
were to marry… I bet the Lord would bless you with a happy, healthy and
handsome child. Good luck and God bless you both.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I suddenly feel the need for confession.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Not yet? Love taking your shots, don’t ya?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: When I see an opening.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That path she was talking about winds through
these falls. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I think… if you get eaten by a bear and
there isn’t a Ranger around, I’m not carrying what’s left of you down
this mountain.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: And they say romance is dead. Timber Falls it
is.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Who’s Lewis and/or Clark?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You really were stoned through high
school.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You’re going to lose that out here.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: It’s fine. I never take it off. Not since
you gave it to me. Betcha don’t remember…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: …February 27, 2006.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I remember every moment with you.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I’ve got you so whipped.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: My hand… Something stuck it.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: It’s okay. It’s not too deep. Let me get the
first aid kit.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Fuck. That stung.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Gotta clean the wound, baby.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You know me and blood… we don’t do so
well.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I know. All done.</p>
<p><strong>off screen</strong>: CRUNCH of something stepping on a
thicket.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Not bad, Nightingale. Not bad at all.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Did you hear something?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s probably the deer.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: The deer went in the other direction.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Maybe it’s someone, or something, stalking
us.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Quit it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Something inhuman watching our every move.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I said, knock it off.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Something coming for you, Sheryl.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Just when I think there’s hope for you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You’re an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: This is a joke. You’re not really mad, are
you? Sheryl…?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m sorry! Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl, wait up!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl?! This isn’t funny.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl?!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl!</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Good old Hansel. Following the trail of
bread crumbs.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You bitch.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Doesn’t feel good to be teased, does it?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Truce?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Truce.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Don’t disappear on me again.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Hey, Brody, Lonnie. Check this out.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Looks like we got ourselves a little
party.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We were just moving our way up the
mountain.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: You were moving your way’round more than
just that.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Like a peach.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You folks best be careful about what you do
up here… Never know who’s watching.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Appreciate the advice…I think we learned our
lesson.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: You city folk, ain’t ya? Up from Charleston
roughing it, seeing how the “other” half lives?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, we’re from Virginia, just up for a weekend
trip. And, uh… you folks live up here?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: It’s easy to spot the city folk. It’s like
they’re trying to be friendly, when really they don’t want to be.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I think you just startled us is all.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We’ll just be on our way. May I have
those?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Finders keepers.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Darryl.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Where you runnin’ off to?</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Yeah, we just getting acquainted and
shit.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: We just want to get a little further along
before the sun sets.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Plenty of time’fore that.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Look. We don’t want any trouble. We just want
to be on our way…</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: And why do you suppose we mean to make
trouble?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You folks enjoy the spirits?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Excuse me? The what?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Spirits.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Booze!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sure. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Why don’t you try a taste of this?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Betcha never tasted nuthin’like that?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’ll sell you the jar for fifty bucks.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Or maybe we could do us a little trade.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Let me get my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Fifty bucks sounds like a bargain. Pay the
man.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Pleasure doing business with ya. Take care
now.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Should you tire of your present company…
just holla and I’ll come running with bells on darling.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You brought a gun?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Why did you bring a gun?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Same reason you brought your cellphone. Better
to have it and not need it. To protect us.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Lotta good it just did.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You want to go back? Sheryl? I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: We should have stuck to one of the patrolled
paths.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You alright?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Do you know how many times I’ve had someone
die on me? How many children? I stopped keeping count.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I thought… I wasn’t thinking. What do you want
me to do?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Get rid of the gun.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What… now? Out here?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I can’t just leave it here in the woods, some
kid could find it.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Then get rid of the bullets now and when we
get home, you get rid of the gun.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Was that all of them?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Oh. Didn’t mean to startle you folks. Just
clearing some of the brush off</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s fine. We were led to believe this trail
wasn’t regularly patrolled.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: It’s not, but… It’s one of my favorite spots,
so I often find an excuse to swing by.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: It’s gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Yup. There are a couple more falls in the
park, but none quite so… inviting as this one. Now don’t take my word
for it, you can see for yourself… How long’s your stay?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Just til Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Yeah, no. The other falls are clear on the
other side. It would take you a couple nights just to get there.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Maybe next time.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: This is a quickie trip. Just getting out of
the city for a couple days.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: The city, huh. Which? If it’s Charleston, I
wouldn’t blame ya. Whole place smells like feet. I gotta haul myself all
the way down to the hospital there for my yearly because the darn HMO’s
rules and regulations won’t let me visit the local Doc. Not my cup of
tea at all, but if you like it there, then…</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: No, we’re not from Charleston.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: But apparently we look like we are.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: We live in Alexandria. It’s just outside of
D.C.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Oh. I’ve been there, few years back. Now that
city I like. Lotta beautiful churches if I recall correctly. Which
congregation do y’all belong to?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Um… Not sure. Sheryl keeps track of all that
for us. Sheryl?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Uh… We’re between congregations at the
moment.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Well… I should get back to work. Sun’ll be
down soon and that path ain’t gettin’clear on its own.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Excuse me… Sir?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: The name’s Clyde.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Clyde, would you recommend a nice spot
nearby to make camp for the night?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Be happy too… Let’s see… Oh, I got it. “Five
Corners” will be perfect. It’s just a bit up the ways here, near the
Lake. It’s five large rocks which sit in a clearing with a view of the
whole park. The rocks retain the heat from the day, so if you set up
camp between them you won’t be so cold.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Sounds perfect.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Just doing my job. You have fun and be
careful. Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: This is incredible.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Ranger said there’s a lake near by.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: The lake. I’d kill to rinse off.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Whoa. Wait a sec. It’ll be dark soon.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Where’s your sense of adventure?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sher. Seriously. Let’s wait `til morning.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Do you know what you are doing?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I think its pretty obvious that I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: That was… the worst dinner ever.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You cooked.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah, I’m aware. You know what would make this
evening perfect? Moonshine. I got a whole jar of it. There’s a sentence
I never thought I’d say. “I have a jar of moonshine.” Matter of fact,
I’ve got enough to share with our entire congregation…</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: … in Charleston.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Our home city, of course. But I should start
with you… Would you like some moonshine?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Then what would you like?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I’d like to fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Not very Christian of you.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I’m more Old Testament.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What’s that mean?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Not sure. But I think it’s the nastier of
the two books.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I was good. I mean, even better than
usual.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: If you don’t say so…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: … if I don’t say so myself, yeah. Top notch
performance. What, you disagree?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Nah, it was good. Do you think I had
anything to do…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No. All me.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Fine. I liked what the old woman said about
us earlier.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: That she thought we were married.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You are relentless.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I wouldn’t be a proper girlfriend if I
didn’t nag every now and then.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I get it, but it makes me feel like the bad
guy every time. Which makes me feel like shit.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t mean that. Where are you
going?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Do out there, what you did in here.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Put out the fire.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Fuck! Sheryl!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl!</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: What is it? Hear something?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Nah. It’s nothing.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Where is she!?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Whoa… take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Who? What the fuck you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What did you do to her?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: I didn’t fuckin’ do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You have Sheryl’s towel…What the fuck did you
do to her?!</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Foun’ towel.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: I foun’ the towel.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You found it? That’s you’re fucking story, you
inbred fuck?! Stop fucking lying or I will kill you!</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Don’ kill me…Please…I foun’ it… Up…Up the
paf back `dere…just a bit ago… fuckin’swear!</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Didn’t think you had dat in you, city boy.
Shit… I just got dis shirt.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Damn shame you lost dat fine piece o’ass.
Something dat sweet don’t come’round every day. Even for pretty folk
like you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: You best hope you find her’fore I do. `cause
I will enjoy tearing her ass apart. And when I’m done there, I will cut
her eyeballs out and skull fuck her. Any luck, Brody’s already beat me
to it.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Michael, can you hear me? Michael…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Ow!</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Look who’s up.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You’re in my home, Michael. You gave me quite a
scare. I thought I lost you.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Lucky the snap didn’t break the bone, just
bruised it. I know that’s of little comfort now, but trust me, it’s a
good thing. That dirty trap however’s prime for spreading infection,
need to finish cleaning out that wound and then I’ll get some “evening
primrose” in you. Same stuff the Indian Tribes used it back in the day
to heal, well… just about everything. So’s do I.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Try and relax.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Thank you. For saving my life.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You don’t have to thank me. Up here, we take
care of one another. That’s the only way any of us survive.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Um… I’m sorry, but I don’t know your name.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Oh for the sake of sunshine… how rude a host am
I? Name’s Ida Foster.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Ida, I need some help.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’m moving as fast as I can, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, not me. It’s Sheryl. My girlfriend. You
met her with me yesterday. Something’s happened to her. She was gone
this morning when I woke up. I looked everywhere and I couldn’t find
her. We need to call someone. A Ranger. Somebody. We need to find her
right away. Do you have a phone?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’m sorry, but I don’t. Never really had use
for one. I do have a radio. We can call down to base if you’d like.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: After we take care of you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m fine, Ida, please… if you could call
now.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You want to lose this leg? Cause that’s what
you’re risking. Soon as we’re done, I’ll call. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Bite down on this… I ain’t gonna lie… Lotta
pain about to hit you sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: It’s okay. It’s almost over.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: We’ll get some of that primrose in you and
you’ll be good as new.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Ida? The radio. Please… Can you call down
please?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’ll take care of it right now.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Ida, you in there?!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: He’s looking for me.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Why’s that?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Ida!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I think he had something to do with Sheryl
going missing.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Ida, lemme in!</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: What do you want, Brody?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’m looking for a man hiker.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: This “man hiker” alone or wit someone?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: He had a lady friend, but… I’m just looking
for him now.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Well, I ain’t seen no one in days.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: What’d he do you for anyway?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: He busted Darryl’s face in with a shotgun.
Left him a mess of blood and teeth. Nearly killed him. You spot anyone
you don’t know, you be sure to find me.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: He’s gone. Brody and those boys are a pain in
the backside. I’m sure that cousin of his had it coming.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What did the Ranger say? Does he need to speak
to me? When is he coming?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Sorry, I wasn’t able to reach anyone.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: God damnit!</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Please don’t take the Lord’s name in vain in
this house.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Drink this.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Something’s not right.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’m sure they’re just on rounds and will be
back any minute. We’ll try them again and we’ll find Sheryl. You’ll see.
She probably just took a wrong turn up here, ended up in the middle of
“don’t know where.” Happens lots of times. Please drink up, Michael, it
will make you feel better.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How did you know my name?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Michael. You keep calling me Michael. You did
it just now. You did before, just after I woke up. You called me
Michael. Nobody calls me Michael.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’m sure you’re mistaken. You musta told me
before.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, I would have told you “Mike.” Only my
grandmother, who’s dead, ever called me Michael.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Well, how else could I have known your
name?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: On my driver’s license and credit cards, it
says Michael. If you stole my wallet from the campsite… that’s how you’d
have known.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You’re accusing me of stealing your wallet? I
saved your life. Twice. Why would I steal your wallet? Now, just drink
your primrose…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Fuck the primrose!</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Where do you think you’re going?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I want to call the Ranger myself.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I’m getting in that room, Ida.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I can’t let you in there.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Where is Sheryl, Ida? She’s in that room,
isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You sinners are all alike. I heard you last
night. Spitting in the face</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You and your bitch whore girlfriend will atone
for your sins.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: A TRAP DOOR. Mike grabs the latch, lifts it
open.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl!?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I need something to cut you down, baby.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Get me out of here. Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: He’ll be back soon.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Who’s he?</p>
<p><strong>off screen</strong>: A LOUD THUD resounds. Where did it come
from?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Come on, come on, come on…</p>
<p><strong>all the lights simultaneously go out. complete and
total</strong>: DARKNESS SURROUND THE YOUNG COUPLE. Sheryl lets rip a
short, but loud SCREAM. Mike quickly silences her.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Mike? Mike?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl, run!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Get the fuck out of here! Now!</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Mike? Mike?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Thank you God…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Oh my stars, what happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You have to help me. I was kidnapped. My
boyfriend came… And this man’s chasing me. He’s chasing me right
now.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Calm down. I can’t make heads or tails of
what you’re saying.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: He’s coming. He’s right behind me.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Look, miss, there’s no one there.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Oh my God, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: It’s going to be fine, Miss. I promise you.
Everything’s going to be fine.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Deacon, what’s going on? How the heck did she
escape?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Want something done, gotta do it
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Perfect. Just perfect. You are lovely as a
summer’s day. It’s almost time.</p>
<p><strong>follow the rope down… pass a pair of bloody and
bruised</strong>: HANDS, WRISTS… keep going… end on Mike.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Deacon!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That’s enough. Get him ready.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: And Jesus answered and said unto them, “Each
man should have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. The
husband should fulfill his marital duty to his wife, and likewise the
wife to her husband.”</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: And so, in the presence of our Lord Jesus
Christ, I ask you Michael… and you Sheryl, do you accept the sacred
covenant of marriage?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’ll ask again… Do you accept this covenant
of marriage?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Then by the power vested in me, I pronounce
you man and wife.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Why are you doing this? We did nothing to you
people. Let us go!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You may kiss the bride.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You fucking people are fucking sick!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Do not use that type of language in this
house again. Now… kiss the bride or… … he’ll cut off your lips.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>let her go! sheryl!</strong>: Let her go!…Please, let her
go!</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I know you will.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Gonna untie your mouth, now. Have a little
“man to man” talk.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Please… It’s not too late. Let us go. We won’t
tell anyone.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: How well do you know your bible, Michael?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Jesus Fucking Christ…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I told you before to watch that mouth,
mister.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You through?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’ll ask again… how well do you know the
bible?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Not very.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That’s okay. It’s fine. That’s why I am here…
teach you the way things are and the way they should be.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I want you, Deacon. I want you to fuck me.
Hard.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Lord knows the will of a man gets tested.
Cruelly most times. But the righteous persevere. They do what needs to
be done, even though they don’t want to. It’s what makes a man, a man.
Let me tell you the story of Judas, he was one of Jesus’s apostles.
Judas led Roman Soldiers to the capture and eventual death of our Lord
Jesus Christ. And now, is supposedly seated next to Satan, his soul
burning in hell forever for this sin. But I don’t believe that’s the
case. I have my own theory. The death of Jesus was predicted thousands
of years before Judas ever came along. And for the prophecy to be
fulfilled, Jesus had to die. If he didn’t, the gates of heaven couldn’t
be opened for mankind. I don’t think, for an instant, Judas wanted to be
the one, but… someone had to. Judas helped Jesus, so Jesus could die for
our sins. Save us all. And I believe at this moment… Judas is in heaven,
despite his sin, because it led to the greater good. Relations prior to
marriage is a sin. You and Sheryl are sinners in the Lord’s eyes. And
because of those sins, your souls are damned. But Ida and Me, we’re
gonna give you a chance to save your souls and do the right thing, but…
as previously stated, you will need to persevere and show the strength
and will of your character. But you’ll do it. Because that’s what needs
to be done.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Deacon!</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You get away from her. Git! Now!</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’m sorry about that, Sugar. My brother, he’s
not well.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: It’s not all his fault. Our father wasn’t very
Christian and then there was the accident. Along with the scarring, lost
use of his vocals. Can’t speak a lick. Now, I’ve spoken to him. What
happened with the others won’t happen to you. He’s promised me that.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I’m gonna take that out of your mouth now. I
brought you some tea, got some primrose in it. Help you relax, get some
rest. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Please don’t do this. Please let me go.
Please..I just want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Drink the tea.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: That’s better. Good girl. I almost forgot to
ask… How does it feel being married?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I thought you’d be happy about that. All I ever
wanted out of life was two things… to be married and to have a baby. The
Lord blessed me with Clyde and I thank Him every day for that.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: But having a baby’s been… complicated.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: She can conceive fine… just… can’t seem to
make it all the way through. Timothy was the toughest… Made it to month
eight.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: City Doctor had some fancy mumbo-jumbo words
for the condition. Breaks my heart every time. That woman was born to be
a mother. It’s her calling in life. Just like you and Sheryl have a
calling.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What exactly do you want from us?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You’re young, strong… It’s gonna be easy for
you. Not like me.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Wh-what…?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You’re gonna have a baby, Sheryl. My baby.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What have you done to her?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: She’ll be out for hours, but she’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Ida’ll come back in a little bit, check to
see that the deed has been done. If it hasn’t…the next time you see your
little lady…a piece of her will be missing.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Now, we know conception’s not automatic. So
don’t feel like all the pressure’s on right now. We’re prepared to do
this however long it takes. You give us the effort each time, eventually
the magic will happen.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You’re out of your fucking minds.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What did I tell you about the language?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Deacon will be right outside that door. The
only door. This room has no windows and is buried twenty feet below
ground. Cutting to the chase… there’s no way out and you can scream
yourself hoarse, no one will hear you.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: We’ll let you have your privacy now. Oh, almost
forgot.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: It’s gotta work this time.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: It will.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Promise me. Promise me, Clyde.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>vfx</strong>: Mike’s breathing INTENSIFIES. PUSH INTO TIGHT
CLOSE UP… His world is not caving in, it’s already caved.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Was I at all unclear yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No, but…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Did you understand what was expected of
you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yes, but… How do you expect…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Clearly you did not understand. You did not
even attempt relations last evening.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What you’re asking to do is sick. You’re
sick.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You didn’t have a problem when penetration
was a sin, but when it’s your wife, it’s sick?!? Unbelievable.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: You knew the rules, Michael. I warned you.
Now, Deacon, here, will remind you.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’m going to be late for work.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Be home at the regular time?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Might be a bit late. I have an errand that
needs attending to.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You don’t have to do this. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What are they doing to him?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You should concern yourself with what’s about
to happen to you.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What are you doing, Ida?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You think you’re so much smarter than me, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Yes you do. Admit it’cause I can see it in your
eyes, darling. With your fancy schools and job and such. You think you
are better than me.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Might surprise you, but I was quite the student
back in the day. Straight A’s. Every subject’cept for Science.
Infuriated me how they tried to explain away the Lord’s creations. Our
teacher, Mr. Billings, once said… in the future, humans won’t be born
with a pinky finger’cause of evolution. Of all the… I shouted, “No! We
are created in the Lord’s image… not some nonsensical theory by
Darwind.”</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I suppose Mr. Billings and Mr. Darwind can
stand up and cheer, because you, little lady… you’re about to
evolve.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No more. Please. No more.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What are you going to do with that?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Please Ida, don’t. Don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You think I want to hurt a pretty thing like
you? Pains me, but… until you and your husband obey, my hands, much like
yours, are tied.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I know about your condition, Ida. It’s not
your fault. There are a lot of women that can’t carry a baby full term.
I know how much you’re hurting.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You don’t know anything about me or what I’ve
gone through.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I’m here for you now. I’ll help you.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You can help… by following the rules.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Clyde!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: G’morning, Brody.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I stopped by your place the other day.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Ida mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: So have you seen or heard anything about that
man hiker?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: In fact I have. I saw him and his lady
leave.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: When was this?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Yesterday. Just before dusk.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Believe what you want.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I saw their car last night in the parking lot
at base. So they didn’t leave, “Just before dusk.”</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Well, I was down at base this morning… car’s
gone now.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Something don’t feel right here, Clyde.
Between you and Ida…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I don’t have time for this…</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Take your hand off me, Brody.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What do you know about that hiker you ain’t
telling me?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I told you, Brody… I saw them leave. Let it
go.</p>
<p><strong>notice</strong>: the back of Mike’s shirt SOAKED in
blood.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: How do you expect me to do this? Like
this?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Do we need to provide you with some more
motivation?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You wouldn’t want to put that lovely bride of
yours through a day like she had today again, now would you?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You’ll never get away with this. We have
friends and family. They know where we went. They’ll come looking for
us. They’ll find us!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: That may very well be… but they won’t find
your car.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Oh baby, what did they do to you? I’m sorry.
I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Are they gone?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Yeah. You’re awake?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I didn’t swallow that shit she gave me.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Oh my God. Mike…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s okay. I’m okay.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You’re not okay. We’re not okay. What are we
gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Maybe… we should just give them what they
want?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: If it stops them from hurting you and me…
maybe we should…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Absolutely not. No fucking way. Forget the
fact, that the moment you get pregnant, they’ll kill me. Then the moment
you give birth, you’re dead. Beyond both of those reasons… ain’t no
fucking way I am going to give them our child.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: For all my coward marriage moments… I’ve
thought about our child. Is that stupid? I picture what he’ll be
like…</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: He?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Wishful thinking. I picture your heart… your
eyes… And I picture us, raising him. Growing old with him. No. Ain’t no
fucking way I’m going to give him to them. They keep talking about sins…
that would be the worst sin of them all. I’ll get us out of this,
Sheryl. I promise you.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: It’s time.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Good morning, Sam.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Ain’t no better than any of the other days,
Evelyn, so bring the “glee” down some, would ya?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Hey, Sam, do you remember a Virginia couple
pass through here sometime Friday?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Friday? Well…There was one couple, but they
didn’t say where they were from.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Gal’s mother’s called three times this
morning. Said she hasn’t heard from her daughter since before she left
and she didn’t show up for work yesterday or today.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: She sure this was the park they were coming
to?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yup. Woman’s already offering up a
reward.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Damn it. Have her fax some photos up here.
Notify patrol.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Been a while since we had a couple go
missing. Twelve months ago the last?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Nine.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You don’t have to check… Nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: We do appreciate your honesty, Michael. And
believe me, we understand your extreme situation, but… Punishment’s
going to have to be handed down.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Clyde, it’s Sam at base, come back.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Go for, Clyde.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Restrain him.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Yeah, morning, Clyde. Got a missing person’s
report. Young Couple out of Alexandria. We’re printing up some flyers
with their photos right now.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I told you. I told they’d be coming.</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: When you get a chance, grab some and let’s
start circulating, huh?</p>
<p><strong>sam</strong>: Clyde?</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Copy that.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Get him in the other room. Now.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Shit. Get rid of the dope.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Morning, gentlemen. Pardon me…
Afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Evelyn, damn, hurts looking at you. When you
gonna give it up to me?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Now with a line like that, it’s a shocker I
haven’t already.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: You stone cold tease.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Was wondering if either of you had seen any
hikers pass by in the last day or so?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: What’s this about?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: These two are missing?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: It would seem so. Why, have you seen
them?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: You talk to Clyde about this?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: All the Rangers are on the lookout. Family’s
even offering up a reward.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Pardon?</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: How much they offering?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Don’t exactly know. I’m guessing it’s a fair
amount.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: Well, me and Lonnie will keep a lookout for
you too. Anything we can do to help.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: You change you mind, I’ll ride you raw.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: It’d be the best fifteen seconds of your
life, darling!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Noose is starting to tighten, Ida.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: No. You promised. You promised, this time,
would be the time. I want that baby. You promised.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: We’re gonna have to double our efforts,
here.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Leave that to me.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I think we have to have another… man to man
discussion, here, Michael.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Seems as though, time is now factoring into
our situation.</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts deacon’s pov</strong>: Sheryl’s mouth/ chest/
legs.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: We’re not violent people, Michael. It pains
us to pain you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I don’t know… Seems as though Deacon and
yourselves get a real kick out of it.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Now see, this is what I am talking about.
It’s your attitude. It’s the disobedience, the cussing…Sooner we get
what we want, then no further harm has to fall upon you and your
wife.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Way I see it, you need us alive. You need us,
period. And now that Park Services and State Police are looking for us,
you’re starting to panic,</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Deacon! Stop right there!</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Out! Get out!</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: This is getting out of hand, y’all. Nobody
wanted what just almost happened to Sheryl to happen. But, you keep
dragging this thing out… things are gonna… happen.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: I sent Deacon away for a bit. He knows he done
wrong. You say right now that you are ready to perform your marital
duties, then I’ll keep him away.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Have you ever thought that God doesn’t want
you to have a child? That’s why he fucking kills them before they’re
born. Because you’re fucking insane monsters that don’t deserve a
child.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You take that back!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Take it back.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Go ahead and torture me. There’s absolutely no
way I would ever give a child of mine to you.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: How very brave. Fine. I won’t torture you. I’ll
torture her. I can bring back Deacon. Let him have her. Plenty of other
holes he can go into where a baby can’t be made.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Or maybe we can just start dicing. All we need
is a healthy heart, brain and uterus. She don’t need the rest of her
fingers, or toes… or her nose, ears. I could carve out her eye right
now.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: Then you will give me my baby. My child, born
in wedlock, saved from its sinner parents and raised to fear God and
give him praise.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: That’s why you married us? So we could
conceive our child in wedlock? The fucking joke’s on you… I’m already
pregnant. Eight weeks yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: You’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I was trying to find the right time to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: No, no, no, no! This can’t be. NO!</p>
<p><strong>off screen</strong>: A GLASS BREAKS. It came from
upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: We shouldn’t just go in. Ain’t right.</p>
<p><strong>brody</strong>: I’m going in. You don’t want to, then don’t.
Check round back or something.</p>
<p><strong>lonnie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Help! Down here!</p>
<p><strong>mike’s pov - under the gap between the floor and
door,</strong>: Lonnie’s body lands. Eyes stare at Mike.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Ida… you know what we have to do?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: No. I can give her an abortion. Get rid of the
bastard child, make them conceive one in wedlock. And then we are right
as rain.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Abortion? No. That we won’t do.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: It’ll work. Ain’t no sin to abort a demon.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: Ida, writings on the wall here. Michael’s
right. With a reward on the table, do you think Brody and Lonnie will be
the only two coming? Gonna have lots people looking for these two. We’re
gonna have to make it so no one can ever find them.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: We’ll find another couple, Ida.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: No. You promised me, Clyde, this time was the
one.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: It’s too dangerous. We’ll find another
couple. A better one.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: It’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: I’ll do what needs to be done. You finish up
here… And watch your time, rain’s coming.</p>
<p><strong>clyde</strong>: What the…?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Believe me, I understand your extreme
situation, but… Punishment’s going to have to be handed down.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: One down.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Fuck.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: No more ammo.</p>
<p><strong>off screen</strong>: In the distance, the IRON DOOR CREAKS
OPEN.</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: In for a penny, in for a pound. I can’t save
your soul now, Michael. I tried. I gave you a way to cleanse yourself of
all your sins and deliver you to heaven… and how do you repay me?</p>
<p><strong>ida</strong>: There is no soul blacker than yours. And now,
by the grace of God, I must deliver you to Satan myself.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: I can’t make it.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I’m not leaving you.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Clyde’s walkie-talkie. It’s probably upstairs.
Find it. Call the Ranger base. My gun. See if you can find our stuff. My
gun’s in my backpack, side pocket.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What good’s the gun? You tossed away the
bullets.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: There’s another box of ammo.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Mike…!?!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Let’s get out of this alive first, then you
can bitch me out, okay?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: It’s okay, baby. Go.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Hello? Come in, please. We need help. Is
anyone there?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Please, someone? Is anyone there that can
help?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: This is Ranger Base, Go again?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Mike!</p>
<p><strong>they both fall uncontrollably down the trap door
steps,</strong>: into…</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Sheryl!</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Burn in hell you sonofabitch!</p>
<p><strong>in the mirror’s reflection - ida, the bloody mess that
she</strong>: IS, STEPS FROM THE SHADOWS, AN IRON FIRE POKER in her
hands.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: You did it, baby. You saved me. You said you
would and you did. Stay with me, Mike. Stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Love you.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Well, if you love me… Fight. Please baby,
fight.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: I’ll be back in a second, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Don’t you even fucking think about leaving
me alone.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Shit. Come on, baby. Fight.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Oh please God.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Called your folks. There gunna meet us at
the hospital. Be a while since they’re coming in from D.C.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Sorry, but I just have to ask… You told the
Sheriff there was someone in on this whole thing with Clyde and Ida. Big
fella, scars all over him? Mame?</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Why? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You’ve had an exhausting night, why don’t
you…</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: We didn’t find anybody like that in the yard
or the house.</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: No. It’s not possible.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Calm down. It’s gunna be alright…</p>
<p><strong>sheryl</strong>: Fuck you it’s gonna be alright.</p>
