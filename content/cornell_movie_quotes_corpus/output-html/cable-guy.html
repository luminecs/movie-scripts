<h1 id="cable-guy">cable-guy</h1>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Jesus, where’s the cable guy already?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: How’s the move going?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Horrible. The cable guy is missing in
action. Apparently he’s going to be here sometime between eight AM and
my death.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You haven’t called Robin have you? Please tell
me you didn’t call her.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No, I’m giving her space. I can’t believe
she’s doing this.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You never should have asked her to marry you.
You’re the mad smotherer.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: All she had to do was say no. She didn’t
have to kick me out. I feel like Felix Unger.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You forced her to evaluate the relationship.
If you didn’t propose she would never have realized how unhappy she
was.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it. So what time
are you going to come by?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I can’t. I’m working double shifts the rest of
the week.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It’s my first night here. Don’t do this to
me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: The other camera guy pulled out his back.
Besides, I spent the last two weeks with you on my couch. Isn’t that
enough?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Fine, fine.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: One piece of advice. Slip the cable guy fifty
bucks, he’ll give you all the movie channels for free. Even the dirty
ones.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I couldn’t. I’m not good at that stuff. What
if he says no? I’ll feel like an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: None of them say no, believe me. I’ll talk to
you later.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Where the hell is he?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Hi, this is Robin. Leave a message. If you
are trying to reach Steven he can now be reached at 555-3837.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Forget it. Idiots.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh great.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t leave! I’m here! I’m here!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hello! Cable Guy!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey, wait!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Well, look who decided to show up. I was
just gonna go collect my retirement pension.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You were supposed to be here four hours
ago.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Was I? So I’m the tardy one. Good to
know.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yes. I had to go to the Bed ’n Bath place,
but now it’s closed.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: They had a lot of cats.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hey, this could be a cool pad. Here is a
comment card.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Please mail it in when I am done.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: These go to your boss?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: No, they go to me. I’m a perfectioniss�
perfectioniss� perfectioniss�t. Now let’s take a look at what we’re
dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Come on baby. Come on baby. Talk to me
baby. Tell me where you like it. That’s it baby.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Here’s your sweet spot.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: So your lady kicked you out.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: In preparing your service I noticed you
were previously wired across town at 1268 and a half Chestnut. Last week
the billing was transferred to one Robin Harris. Smells like heartbreak
to me.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I really don’t want to talk about it with
you. Could you please just install my cable? I’m going to get
dressed.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: No sweat.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hey, I’m going to go to the hallway so I
can access the floorboards. Don’t be spooked if you hear someone
crawling underneath you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Okay, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Put on your bathing suit ’cause you’ll be
channel surfing in no time.</p>
<p><strong>rikki klieman</strong>: So ends day fifty-four of the trial
of former child star Sam Sweet who has been accused of shooting his twin
brother, Stan, in cold blood. The twins were stars of the hit sitcom
“Double Trouble” which aired from nineteen seventy-seven till nineteen
eighty-four.</p>
<p><strong>rikki klieman</strong>: Life wasn’t so sweet after the
cancellation of their program. Hollywood chewed them up and spit them
out. A frustrated Sam turned to petty larceny, while his more
impressionable brother, Stan, fell in with a fringe cult called “The
Brotherhood of Friends.” Reduced to tabloid fodder a fury was growing
inside of Sam. A burning need to be recognized as an individual, not a
person famous for having an identical twin. A need that took the form of
four shotgun blasts on the night of November fourteenth. And so today
his attorneys continue the unusual defense of “Twin Envy.”</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Guilty, guilty, guilt-freakin-tee. I hope
they fry this bastard.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: The arrangement of your major appliances
and your furniture was causing some noisy pics and hum bars in your
reception. I moved a few things. Cleared it right up. Is that cool?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I� guess so.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You programmed? Then let me slave your
remotes.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Ooh, maybe we should leave these two
alone.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So after this I’ll only need one remote for
everything?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You know you’re pretty good at this. You
could be a cable guy yourself. Now let me check your levels.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: All right. That about does it. I just
have some paperwork for you to fill out. Sign here.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: That gave me power of attorney over you.
Joking.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m about finished here. Okay. I feel
good about this.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: One thing.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I� uh� I have this friend and he said he
gave his cable guy fifty bucks and he got free movie channels. Have you
ever heard of anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You mean illegal cable?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Uh� yes.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Who told you that? I want his name.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You’re offering me a bribe? What you have
just done is illegal, and in this state if convicted, you could be fined
five-thousand dollars or spend six months in a correctional
facility.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Please� that was dumb. I was just making
conversation �</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m just jerking your chain. Wake up
little snoozy. I’ll juice you up. All it is is a push of a button.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh, great. How much?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Don’t worry about it. I couldn’t charge
you. Your girl just booted you. Consider it one guy doing another guy a
solid.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That is so nice.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hey, you’re a ‘nice’ guy. You’d be
surprised how many customers treat you like shit, like I’m a god damn
plumber or something. Here is my personal beeper number. It’s just for
my preferred customers. Never call the company, they’ll just put you on
hold.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Thanks. Really. You’re gonna get some good
marks here.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Maybe some day I’ll take you out to the
satellite and show you how all this stuff works. It’s really
incredible.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Sure. We should do that one day.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: How ’bout tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Tomorrow? Tomorrow’s not good.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: What are you going to do, sit home and
stew about your ex?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Oh, okay. I guess I crossed the line.
Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You didn’t cross the line.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: No? Cool. I’ll pick you up at six-thirty.
On the flip side.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: �There are twenty-four classrooms; each can
be converted into a 1400 square foot home. The facility has two tennis
courts, an Olympic size pool and full gym, with a stage if the residents
decide they want to perform “Oklahoma.”</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The kitsch appeal of living in an old
schoolhouse should be very attractive to young, upwardly mobile home
buyers. And most important, the structure is available in foreclosure.
If we put down a cash bid, we’re going to steal this thing.</p>
<p><strong>mr. daniels</strong>: Great work Steve-o. So you’re feeling
good?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mr. daniels</strong>: Did I hear something about you having
some troubles at home?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Robin and I have been having a difficult
time. I moved out, but I really think it’s only temporary.</p>
<p><strong>mr. daniels</strong>: Gotcha. I love this project, but it’s a
big mother. Know what I mean? If it fails, corporate’s going to have my
ass. I’ve got confidence in you, but you hear where I’m coming from,
bro?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Absolutely. Now I’ve got more time than
ever. It’s a good thing. I know I can pull this thing off.</p>
<p><strong>mr. daniels</strong>: Then what are you doing talking to me?
You’ve got a lot of work to do. Get to it!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Thank you. I will.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Steven, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I was just in the area. Thought I’d pop by.
How’s work? How’d the big teen crush article come out?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: They liked it. I thought we agreed we weren’t
going to see each other for a month.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know, it’s just Daniels accepted my
proposal to renovate the old schoolhouse.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: That’s wonderful, congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know I’m breaking the rules, but come have
dinner with me tonight to celebrate.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I don’t think we should.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Come on, this is the biggest day of my
career.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Don’t put me in this position.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What position? I want to share this with
you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I love you, but I need to take some time on
my own to see how I feel. You agreed to this. I mean� this is exactly
why we broke up, because you never listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: What? Now we’re broken up? What happened to
‘trial separation?’</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I can’t get into this now. If you haven’t
noticed, I’m at work.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Sorry to disturb you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Steven. Congratulations. I know how much this
means to you. You deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Steven!!!! Stev-ey!!!! Let’s go!!!!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Steven!!!! Hey buddy!!! Come on
down!!!</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Coming up next a special report,
“Loneliness, America’s Silent Killer.”</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What the hell.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Howdy partner. Climb aboard.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Thanks for coming out. You know most
people think cable is just a simple co-ax that comes out of the wall.
They never take the time to understand how it works.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Where exactly are we goin?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: We’re going to take a ride on the
information superhighway.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: �It all started in Lansford, Pennsylvania
where Panther Valley Television, with the assistance of Jerrod
Electronics, created the first cable television system.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I went to Lansford once. It’s the Cable
Guy’s Mecca. It was very emotional.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I come here to think sometimes. To clear
my head.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: There she is. Right now she’s sending
entertainment and information to millions of satisfied citizens.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’s pretty impressive.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: See, I knew the moment I met you that you
would appreciate this.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: The future is now. Soon every American
home will integrate their television, phone, and computer. You’ll be
able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling
on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play Mortal Kombat with
a friend in Vietnam. There’s no end to the possibilities. Come on up!
What are you waiting for?!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Sometimes I’ll sit here and imagine that
there are billions of bits of information surging through me.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ve watched a lot of TV in my life. I guess
I’ve always taken it for granted.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: When I was a kid my mom worked nights.
Never met dad. But the old TV was always there for me.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know what you mean. My dad was there, but
he might as well have been gone. My mom is a stewardess. She was always
out of town.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: That’s tough. You must have a lot of
abandonment issues. Reality isn’t “Father Knows Best,” it’s a kick in
the face on Saturday night. But what doesn’t kill us makes us stronger,
right?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You know my brother’s a speech
therapist.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: So, you’re pretty love struck about your
lady, huh?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I miss her. I asked her to marry me, and she
asked me to move out.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: She said she felt pressured. Can you believe
that?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Women are a labyrinth. Can I be frank? I
don’t think you listen to her. I think you try to tell her what she
wants to hear. She wants you to thirst for knowledge about who she is.
All the complicated splendor that is woman. When your love is truly
giving, it will come back to you ten-fold.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re right. That is remarkably
insightful.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Yeah, it was Jerry Springer’s final
thought on Friday’s show.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You know what? Women are suckers for
“Sleepless in Seattle.” It’s on HBO this month. That’s your bait right
there.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Robin loves that movie.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: They all do. Next time you talk to her
tell her you’re cooking yourself dinner, and watching it by yourself.
Sound like you’re happier than a pig in shit. She’ll come running.
Betcha. Then just play it cool.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Maybe I will.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Thanks a lot. I’m embarrassed to say this,
but I don’t know your name. What is it?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You really want to know my name? You do?
Really? It’s Ernie Douglas. But my friends call me Chip.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ll see ya’ Chip.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Let’s just remember right now. You know
some people walk through their entire lives and never find a true
friend. I guess we’re the lucky ones.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Uh� good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Later buddy. I’ll catch ya’ on the flip
side.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I don’t listen to you. I pretend to
understand but I’m really just saying what I think you want to hear. So
from now on I’m going to try my best to listen more because I do love
you and am interested in learning about every detail about the
complicated splendor that is you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I want us to get back together, but I can
see why taking this time might be good for us. So, I’m not mad.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Sometimes time apart is healthy.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re right. Well, that’s what I came here
to say. Look, I’ve got to get back to the office.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: So, are you doing anything tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m just going to cook myself dinner and
watch a movie. “Sleepless in Seattle” is on cable.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: If you’re around you should drop by and
check out the new apartment.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Okay, maybe I will.</p>
<p><strong>tabitha soren</strong>: Today in the Sam Sweet case the
prosecution played the 911 call that Sam Sweet made the night he
murdered his brother. Keep in mind, he confessed one month later.</p>
<p><strong>sam sweet v on the tape</strong>: Hello, please send help. My
twin brother has been shot.</p>
<p><strong>911 operator</strong>: Slow down sir. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sam sweet</strong>: Oh my god, they shot him with a shot gun
four times. I mean I think it was a shotgun. Who would do such a thing?!
I think it was an Asian gang or something. They were speaking some other
language.</p>
<p><strong>tabitha soren</strong>: Hmm. Who indeed? Coming up next, a
rare interview with Michael Jackson’s zoo- keeper.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Here, here, here.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Shit! My fault! My fault!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Not your fault. I’m in the zone. There is no
stopping me today.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hey, you guys play here, too? Cool. I was
just in the neighborhood. Thought I’d run the court for a couple of
innings.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Great. We need another man.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: This is� Chip Douglas� my cable guy.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: We met about a week ago during a routine
installation, but I feel like I’ve known him my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Oh really. That’s sweet. All right Chip
Douglas, you’re on shirts. Let’s play.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: No, I want to be on Steven’s team. I’m
skins.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I don’t care, I’ll be shirts. Let’s just
play.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Wait a sec’. I’ve got to warm up.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Let’s get it on!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Are you any good?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Feed me under the boards and you’ll find
out.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Traveling! That’s traveling!</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah, whatever you say Chip.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: All right, so we’re playing that type of
game. Prison rules. I get it.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Feed me the rock! Feed me the rock! I’m
open!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: And one! That’s definitely a foul! You
want to mug me, my wallet is in my other pants.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Don’t play from fear Steven. We can take
these guys.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Take it to the hole!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hey, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Let’s switch. I’ll cover Rick.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What the hell was that? That’s it. I’ve had
enough.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Thanks for bringing your “friend”.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Good game. You were tough out there. Your
play brought me up to a higher level. I mean that.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: It was payback time. I was protecting
you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You ruined the game.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I don’t appreciate your tone Steven.
That’s not the way friends speak to each other.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What are you talking about? I don’t even
know you!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Well let’s fix that. Let me buy you a
Heineken?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No, I’m going home.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Well, uh, I guess we’ll talk later. I’ve
got to go shower up and do some stuff. I’ll call you if I get a chance.
Or you call me� or something.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: And down low.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Too slow. Have a good one.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah, have a good one.</p>
<p><strong>message voice</strong>: You have eleven messages.</p>
<p>****: Steven, it’s mom. Give me a call. I’m still your mother.</p>
<p>****: I’m getting on. Steven call your mother.</p>
<p>****: Hey Steven. Just checking in. Give me a ring. I’m at 555-4329.
What’s up Steven? I’m at a pay phone. If you’re there pick up. Pick up.
Pick up. Okay, I’ll be home later. I’ll talk to you then.</p>
<p>****: Okay I’m home now. Give me a buzz when you get in. I’ll be here
pretty much all night. Bye. Hey Steven. Quick question, give me a call
when you get a chance. I was just taking a whiz, thought you might have
called. Okay later. Sorry, I had call waiting, didn’t get to it, thought
it might have been you. All right, bye.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: �We’re having ourselves quite a little
game of phone tag here. You’re it! �I was just blow drying my hair and I
thought I heard the phone ringing. �you’re a tough man to reach. I guess
you’re too busy to call your friends.</p>
<p>****: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey, good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Come on in. What do you think of the
place?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You made some interesting choices laying out
the room.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’s actually where the movers put the
furniture. I’m gonna change it, very soon.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No, I like it.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: So how’s work?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Work’s good.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How’s Hal?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t get me started. That guy has no
vision. It’s like working for Mr. MaGoo. He’s just worthless.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It’s just great that you’re getting to do it.
It’s a real step up.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know. Now if only someone at corporate
smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff
done.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It’s nice to see you doing so well.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Well, it’s nice just to see you. Hey, it
should be starting.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Damn cable is out. Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It’s alright. We can watch it another
night.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No, no. We really should see it now. Now’s a
good time.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Wait, wait. I know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The Cable Guy’s a friend of mine. I’ll just
page him. We’ll have this fixed in no time.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That was� fast.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Is there a problem with your service?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah� my cable went out.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: So you called me. Interesting how you
call when you need something. Is that how you treat people?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ve been really busy. You’ve got to get my
cable going, Robin is here. This is really important.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: But calling me back isn’t?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m sorry. Please, you’ve got to help
me.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Why should I help you? I gave you free
cable. What have you ever done for me?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Anything you want. Name it � quickly.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Tomorrow night, we hang out.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Fine, whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: God bless you. You’re too good to me.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: All set.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So what’s with the cut cord?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: That’s for effect. See ya’ tomorrow
Steven. She’s pretty. And don’t kiss her. Don’t even touch her. Fight
the urge at all costs. It will pay off later with�</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Enjoy the flick.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Sorry about yesterday. I was in kind of a
weird mood. How’d things go with you? Keep ’em closed.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Pretty well. We’ll see. Look, about the
other night. I didn’t appreciate you –</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Don’t peek. I want this to be a
surprise.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I really don’t need to be surprised. Where
are we going?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Only the best restaurant in town.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Okay, here we are. Open sesame.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Medieval Times?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I know what you’re thinking. Don’t worry,
I’m buying.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Funny. I never thought I would ever come
here.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I love this place. I come here twice a
week.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Oh man, that’s my look. I love big butts.
Ow, that hurts.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: There oughta be a law. Man she is hot.
It’s just not fair.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Please don’t.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You know what I need right now? Pooooon
tang. And I’m not talking about the place in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Good to know.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Welcome to Medieval Times. My name is
Melinda. I’ll be your serving wench. May I get you something from the
bar keep?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Dost thou have a mug of ale for me and me
mate? He has been pitched in battle for a fortnight an has a King’s
thirst for the beer thust thou might have for thust.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: I’ll be right back my lord.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: There you go.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Thanks for the help.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Steven, don’t turn around, but there is a
woman eyeing you like you are a piece of meat and she hasn’t eaten in a
week.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Really? What does she look like?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Shoe’s a hottie. I wish she was checking
me out. Man – she is on fire! Total robo-babe.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Don’t look.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ve got to look.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Okay, but play it cool. Just turn like
you are looking for the waitress.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Ha-ha. I’m just messing with your mind.
But you fell for it man. You are one horny Indian Chief.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You got me.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: So what did you want to rap about?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hold that thought. Show’s on.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Welcome to a magnificent journey into the
past. This is Medieval Times!</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Are you prepapred for a night of feasting and
sport the likes of which ye will never forget?!</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: I charge you to stand up on your feet and
cheer for your section’s knight!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Let the games begin! The Red Knight
rules! Blue Knight! You’re going down! Going down!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Could I get a knife and fork?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: There were no utensils in Medieval Times,
so there are no utensils at ‘Medieval Times.’ Do you want a refill on
that Pepsi?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: There were no utensils, but there was
Pepsi?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Look, I have a lot of tables to get
to.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Spill his blood! Take his kead! Show no
mercy!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Come on, get into it, we won!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Way to go Red Knight. Good job of killing.
Good work.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: So, what were you saying before?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: How do I put this? I’ve really enjoyed
hanging out with you, but…</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: That’s why I became a cable guy. To make
friends like you. Every time I walk up to a new door, that door is a
possibility for friendship. When I walked in your apartment I knew there
was something there. I just knew it.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh lord. I want you to know –</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: We have reached the climax of our competition
good people! Now, two noble men from our audience will battle to the
death to resolve a grievance. Will a Master… Steven M. Bartowsky and
Lord Ernie Douglas make you way to the fighting pit!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: We’re going to do battle. It’ll be
fun.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Is this a normal part of the show?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: No, but I give all the Knights free
cable. They said it would be cool if we just went at it for a little
while.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Is this safe?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: That’s what the armor’s for.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What are we supposed to do? We’ve got to be
careful we don’t hurt each other.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I cannot listen to any of your
instructions for you are my sworn enemy, and are about to meet your
demise.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Let the battle begin. Come now people, let me
hear your voices!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Just take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m trying to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey, watch it!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: This is just like when Spock had to fight
Kirk on ‘Star Trek.’ Best friends forced to do battle.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: That’s the spirit. Let’s give ’em a good
show.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: So that’s how it’s gonna be, huh? All
right. If you want to play rought, Daddy can play rough.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Chip, this isn’t funny! Will you stop
it!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: The name is Spock. If we don’t battle to
the death, they’ll kill us both. Good-bye Jim.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: This isn’t ‘Star Trek!’</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>host</strong>: Quickly, muster a top your steed. Get on the
god damn horse! I don’t think he’s kidding!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t do this!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Jim, we have no choice!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh my god.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Well done good sir. You are the victor,
but we shall meet again.</p>
<p><strong>35 int. steven’s apartment building - night</strong>: They
are walking up the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You’ve got a real warrior’s instinct.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ve got to admit there’s a real feeling of
power holding that jousting stick.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: If Robin saw you tonight, she would be
begging you to take her back. I’m telling you these knights get laid all
the time.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: We should go again next week.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Easy there Lancelot.</p>
<p><strong>36 int. steven’s apartment - continuous</strong>: Steven pops
into the kitchen and hits a button on his answering machine.</p>
<p><strong>machine</strong>: You have zero messages.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Nobody loves ya. Hey, I think I left my
staple gun in the living room the other day. Could you be a pal?</p>
<p><strong>36aa int. living room - continuous</strong>: Steven turns on
the lights.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I took the liberty of updating your in
home entertainment system. I got you the big screen, plus THX quality
sound that would make George Lucas cream in his pants.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You went in my house when I wasn’t home?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: How else was I supposed to get the stuff
in here? Magic?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: How much did this cost?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Practically nothing. I have a connection.
Preferred customer. I hook him up, he hooks me up.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Look, I can’t accept this. I wouldn’t feel
right.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Yes but you give me something so much
more valuable� friendship.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: And you’ve given me friendship, so we’re
even. Really, don’t take it personally, but you’ve got to take it
back.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Well, my buddy with the pick-up truck
works all week. Is it all right if I leave it here till Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Sure, no problem. And don’t get me wrong. I
really appreciate the gesture.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Mm-hmm. Staple gun?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh, right.</p>
<p><strong>36a int. steven’s office - next day</strong>: Steven dials
the phone. On his computer screen a graphic reads “HELLO STEVEN - HAVE
A</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Robin, it’s Steven again. I’m still trying
to reach you. Okay, I’m at work. Call me.</p>
<p><strong>mr. daniels</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>mr. daniels</strong>: Good good?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>mr. daniels</strong>: Good. Keep it up.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Robin on line two.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey, I had the best time the other night.
When am I going to get you on my couch again?</p>
<p><strong>36b int. van - day</strong>: The Cable Guy is driving around.
He speaks on a cellular phone.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Well tonight’s not looking too good. How
about tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Chip?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I knew I’d get you on the phone that way.
Listen, that equipment will be history the day after tomorrow. It sure
would be a pity to leave that karaoke machine a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Tomorrow night, you are having a karaoke
jam. No ifs ands or buts. Well maybe a few butts. Later gator.</p>
<p><strong>close up - an old man’s face intensely singing “american
woman.”</strong>: We pull out to reveal we are in Steven’s living room.
It is populated with about twenty odd looking misfits mingling and
dancing to the music. Among them we see Rick looking very
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>37aa int. kitchen - continuous</strong>: Steven is on the
phone. He is dressed up. Occasionally a misfit enters and grabs a drink
from the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey Robin. What’s up? Did you get my
message?</p>
<p><strong>37a int. - robin’s apartment - intercut</strong>: The scene
intercuts between the two locations. Robin is dressed up, and on her way
out.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Yes. You left me five messages. It king of
freaked me out.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Sorry. I’ve been trying to reach you ’cause
I’m having a party. You’ve got to come over.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I can’t. I’m going to dinner with
someone.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Dinner? What, like a date?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Not really a date.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’ve got a date?! I thought things were
going well between us.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: They are.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So why are you going out on a date?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I made it before we got together the other
night. I knew you would freak out.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m not freaking out.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Yes, you are freaking out.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m not. I just can’t believe you would do
this.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m not doing anything wrong. I’m allowed to
date. It’s not like we’re back together. We had a good time the other
night, and you’re already pressuring me.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Fine, enjoy yourself. Have fun.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I will.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Fine. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: This is just a sign that you need to live
a little. She’s having fun, and you should too.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Damn right I’m right.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh, I got you a little something.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I thought you said we were even. You’re
breaking the rules.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So shoot me.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: My brother said it might help with your
lisp.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Words cannot express�</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It’s no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Yes it is.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Now I’m on a mission. This has got to be
the best party ever! Let’s rock.</p>
<p><strong>37b int. living room - continuous</strong>: They walk into
the living room. A sad looking OLDER MAN is singing “Superfreak.”
Everyone’s having fun. We see a couple of off duty policemen in uniform
mingling with the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’ve got plenty of friends.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: These people are acquaintances. They’re
not ride to the airport friends, like us. Whoa, chick alert at three
o’clock. A real barn burner. Don’t look.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re playing with me again.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: No sirree Steven. This woman is all over
you like a lamp-shade.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Did it just get hotter in here? Oh, that
hurts.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Who’d she come with?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I don’t know, but she looks pretty
available to me. I’d strike while the iron is hot. He who hesitates,
masturbates, know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A nerdy, balding man walks over to
Rick.</p>
<p><strong>odd man</strong>: He sure can throw a party. Chip’s an
incredible man. I really admire him.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Where do you know him from?</p>
<p><strong>odd man</strong>: He hooked up my cable. Didn’t charge me
either. That’s the kind of guy he is.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Steven slowly walks over to the pretty
woman.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey. I’m Steven.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Heather.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Can I get you something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Sure. I’ll have a shot of tequila if you
will.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Coming right up.</p>
<p><strong>37c int. living room - later</strong>: AT THE KARAOKE AREA -
Steven and Heather are singing “You’re the One that I Want” from
“Grease.” They are both drunk, and having a great time. The Cable Guy
walks over to Rick.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m glad you accepted my invitation.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Steven invited me.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Look at him. Have you ever seen him so
alive? He’s changing, Rick. You’ve got to learn to live with that.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I don’t know what your story is “Chip
Douglas,” but I’m going to find out.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Oooh. How dramatic.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’m getting out of here.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Why? This is a great party. This girl is
really into me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You’re whacked man. That guy is bad news.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You don’t even know him. You’re just mad
’cause he kicked your ass in basketball.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I can’t even deal. I’m outta here.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hello everyone. First of all I’d like to
thank Steven for being such a terific host.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Don’t forget to kick in some spinach for
the beer. Steven ain’t made of money. And I expect some of you to join
in the clean up crew.</p>
<p><strong>off duty cop</strong>: Sing something! Do a song!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: No� I really couldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>odd man</strong>: Come on! Do your song!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Okay, just to stop that guy from begging.
This number is dedicated to all of the ladies in the house.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You sounded just like Olivia Newton
John.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I’ve been practicing for years.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: I can barely hear you. Do you want to talk
in the other room?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh� okay.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: She says she wants a break, and that’s fine
with me. I think I needed some time also.</p>
<p><strong>heather</strong>: Yeah. I know what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Good morning sleepy head. I hope you
don’t mind, I crashed on the couch. Bacon and eggs coming up.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Where did Heather go?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I heard her slip out early this
morning.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What a night. That was just what I
needed.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You look like a new man.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I feel like a new man. I was getting so used
to being rejected. I really liked her.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hey, it was my treat.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What do you mean it was “your treat?”</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You know, I bought this time, you buy
next time.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Buy what?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You know, the women.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You mean Heather is a prostitute?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Of course she is. Do you think a woman
like that would hang out with us if we weren’t paying? Don’t tell me you
didn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I can’t believe this.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: She’s clean I assure you. I tried her out
last week to make sure she was top quality, and I’m as healthy as a
horse. Not a drip. She’s the best, ask any of my friends.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: You’ve got to be kidding? Please tell me
she’s a friend of yours. You’re just playing with my mind again,
right?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I wish I had friends like that.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Get out of my house!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Don’t be ashamed of yourself. I know she
was a working girl, but she kind of liked you. You might have been able
to get a freebie.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Out, now! I don’t ever want to see you
again. Robin is never going to forgive me.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’ll tell you how to handle that. Don’t
tell her. You want to get her back, I’ll help you get her back.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I don’t want your help. I want you to leave.
And take that stuff out of here.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Whatever. I can take a hint. I’ll see
ya’.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: No, I’m meeting someone here.</p>
<p><strong>bathroom attendant</strong>: Most appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You’ve been working hard. Take a
break.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: My brother and I wanna start our own sun block
company. But the twist is, it’s only for skiing. SkiBlock. Or SunSki. We
haven’t decided yet. Maybe BlockSki. Do you think that sounds good?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: BlockSki? That sounds right.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So, Gail told me you’re just coming off a
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Well, not really. We’re kind of in a holding
pattern. He wants more of a commitment, but I don’t think I’m ready. I
just want to have a good time for a while.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Then we got to get you on a Skidoo!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Skidoo?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: High powered snow mobile. It’ll blow your mind.
It flies over powder like it’s glass.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, how are you doing on that chicken? Have
the eggs hatched yet? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So, how’s your work going?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It’s been crazy. They just hired a �</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hold that thought. I have to use the rest room.
Be right back.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Towel please.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Enjoy your meal</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Good evening sir. Pleasant night, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: But I guess the weather’s always pleasant
in here. The winters are remarkably mild.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: If you need anything, just let me know.
Anything at all.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I think I can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m here to serve you.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Jesus! Get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Most people never bother to take
advantage of all my services, for instance �</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I can help you wash up. Cleanliness is so
very important.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Then once you’re done I have a variety of
skin care products which can make you look years younger.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: This lotion is superb at removing liver
spots.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: This one is an excellent moisturizer.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: And one can never underestimate the
effects of a good cologne.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Mm� High Karate. And now a touch of
powder.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Ooh, I almost forget, it’s oh so very
important to be properly tweezed.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You’re on a big date, you’ll need fresh
breath.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Whoops, that’s not mouth wash. But that
reminds me. Proper hair care is a must.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Looking good, now let’s dry you off.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Now suck it. Suck the air!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: from this angle you look just like Neil
Armstrong experiencing G-Force. I believe you have the “right
stuff.”</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Don’t worry about the tip. But I’ve got
one for you. Stay away from Robin. She’s taken.</p>
<p><strong>anchor man</strong>: Here’s a bizarre story from downtown,
where a man was beaten in a restroom by an assailant disguised as a
bathroom attendant. The victim has been unable to speak since the
unmotivated attack.</p>
<p><strong>anchor man</strong>: A police sketch artist put together this
drawing from witnesses’ descriptions.</p>
<p><strong>anouncer</strong>: Tonight on Fox, the true story behind the
trial that’s captured the nation.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The jury may still be out, but the
chilling facts are in. Eric Roberts, in his dramatic debut is Sam and
Stan Sweet. “Brother, Sweet Brother: The Killing of Stanton Sweet.”
Tonight on Fox.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Excuse me, apartment 202 is Robin
Harris?</p>
<p><strong>female neighbor</strong>: It’s right upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: It’s the Cable Guy.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: There’s no problem with my cable.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’ve got an upgrade order for one Robin
Harris. The Rainbow package, that’s every pay channel available.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I didn’t order this.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Apparently you’ve got a secret
admirer.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Was it a man named Steven?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: No, I promised Steven I wouldn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Whoops, I slipped. Well you didn’t hear
it from me.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m sorry Steven. I’m just a man.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: That about does it. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: So, are you a friend of Steven’s?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m proud to say I am. I installed his
cable recently, and we just hit it off.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: That’s right. You fixed his cable the other
night. So you guys are going out a lot?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Not really. That man is devoted to you.
You know I’m probably crossing a boundary telling you this, but he’s
really crazy about you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Did he say that?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Only every five minutes. Quite frankly,
I’m sick of hearing it. No, I’m just kidding with you. He’s a good man.
He mentioned that you guys have had some problems.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Well, it’s a little complicated.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: It always is. You know I asked a woman to
marry me once. She said she wanted to think about it. We agreed to take
some time apart to re-assess our feelings. To give each other� space.
Well, she is no longer with us.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Sometimes you don’t have the time you
think you have. Just promise me you’ll never go bungee jumping in
Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Anyway, I’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Robin?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I� love you too.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: That was so sweet of you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh� well�</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You didn’t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I� wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Giving me free cable. Only you would do
that.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You got it? Great.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Yes, your friend came by.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: My friend?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: The Cable Guy. I liked him. He was kind of
goofy, but nice. Thank you so much for doing that.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m� glad you liked it. I’ve wanted to do
something nice for you, but I’ve been trying to give you your space.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Well, I don’t think we should make rules
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Call me later if you’re around?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Sure. I’ll call you as son as I get home.
Bye.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Steven, are you ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The concert. Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Robin just called. I think we’re getting
back together.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So you’re blowing me off? I can’t believe
this.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: This is the first time she asked to get back
together.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You do this every time. You only call me after
a girl breaks your heart. “Oh Rick can I stay on your couch? Let’s talk
all night about how mean girls are.” Then as soon as a relationship
starts again it’s bye-bye Rick. I don’t know why I fall for it
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Can’t you get someone else to go?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Maybe I’ll take MY cable guy.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Pretty smooth work. I set ’em up, you
knock ’em down.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Robin. I got her back for you. I juiced
her up.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: How do you know we’re back together?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Free cable is the ultimate
aphrodisiac.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I don’t want you messing around with my
life. You’ve caused enough trouble as it is.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I know. I felt bad about the other night,
so I wanted to make it up to you. So what are you doing? Do you want to
catch a bite?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Look, I appreciate you helping me out with
Robin. But you have to understand, I’m going to have to work extra hard
to not screw this relationship up again. You’re a great guy, but I just
don’t have any room in my life for a new friend. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I appreciate your honesty. You’re a real
straight shooter.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So, you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hey, I’m a big boy. It’s no big deal.
Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: All right� well, take care.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Have a good one.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hey, it’s Chip Douglas.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Chip Douglas?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Your cable guy.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Oh, hi. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I feel kind of weird calling you. It’s
just� I’m worried about Steven.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Something isn’t right. He hasn’t been
himself lately. Have you noticed anything?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: No, things are actually going really
well.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Should I be worried?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Nope. I’m probably just being a nervous
nellie. Let’s just keep our eyes open.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I will. Good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Steven Bartowsky please.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Sorry Robin. He’s in a meeting.</p>
<p><strong>sales manager</strong>: The response to our initial offering
has been remarkable. A local investment group has decided to buy the
entire complex and turn them into rentals. In retrospect I must admit we
made one big mistake.</p>
<p><strong>sales manager</strong>: We should have asked for more
money.</p>
<p><strong>mr. daniels</strong>: I just want to put this out there,
Stevey. You did it bro. You laid your cajones, and mine, out on the
table, and you slam dunked it. Way to go. Now watch, they’ll kick you
upstairs ahead of me. All right, in other business�</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: Pssst. Steven.</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: I really need to speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It can wait.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Is there a Steven Bartowsky
here?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Uh� I’m Steven Bartowsky. What’s going
on?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: You are under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>mr. daniels</strong>: On what charge?</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Receipt of stolen merchandise.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What? I never �</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Please put our hands on the
table.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Please follow my instructions. Hands
on the table.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: Hands behind your back.</p>
<p><strong>police officer #2</strong>: You have the right to remain
silent. Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. You
have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney one will
be provided for you. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: This is all a mistake. I didn’t accept any
stolen goods.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: �you’re getting THX quality sound that
would make George Lucas cream in his pants � cream in his pants.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey, relax. I’m the one who’s going to
jail.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I can’t believe you did this.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I didn’t do anything. My cable guy gave me
all that stuff as a present.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: A stereo system and a big screen TV as a
present? You expect me to believe that? You know you’re killing your
mother with this.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I swear it’s true.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Why would you accept such extravagant
gifts?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I don’t know. I shouldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: What is really going on here Steven? Are you
on something?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m fine! I didn’t do anything! Please call
my cable guy, his name is Ernie Douglas.</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Steven, the police looked into it, nobody
named Ernie Douglas works for ‘The Cable Company.’</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: You want to tell us the truth now</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’s got to be a mistake. Oh, this is not
happening.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yes it is, and it’s killing your mother. Did
you deliberately want to ruin our fortieth anniversary party on Monday,
Steven?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Yeah, Dad, I did. It’s all a big plan. When
can you get me out of here?</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: Unfortunately it’s too late to get a bail
hearing today. You’re going to have to spend the weekend in county lock
up.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: The entire weekend?</p>
<p><strong>prisoner #1</strong>: New meat! Look at the pretty boy!</p>
<p><strong>prisoner #2</strong>: Nobody touches him, he’s mine! You
touch him, you’re dead!</p>
<p><strong>prisoner #3</strong>: Is baby scared? Don’t cry baby!</p>
<p><strong>angry prisoner</strong>: Ooh, looks like I won the
lottery.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What did you hear? What did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hello Steven. I came as soon as I
heard.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Who are you?! What’s your real name?!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: So many questions.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I didn’t do this to you, you did this to
you. You need to learn who your friends are.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You set me up.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I taught you a lesson. I can be your best
friend, or your worst enemy. I hope you’ll choose the latter� I mean,
the former. You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’ll never be your friend. You need
help.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Right now I think you’re the one who
needs help. I’m here to give you comfort.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Come on, touch it.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Come on. You need human contact. Touch
it.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I will not touch it.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What are you doing? Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I know how you’re feeling right now.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m here for you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Get off there! Are you trying to get me
killed?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I was just messing with your mind. That
was from ‘Midnight Express.’ Awesome film. Oliver Stone won the Academy
Award for the screenplay.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Guard! Guard!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Don’t you worry about Robin, I’ll make
sure she’s well taken care of.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You go near her, I’ll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey, this is the guy who framed me!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Louis, how’d you like that Tyson fight on
Pay Per View? I told you it’s more fun when it’s Free Per View.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Sea shells. Sea shells. Salmon. Salmon.
Silverware. Silverware. Suspicious. Suspicious. Sensational.
Sensational.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hello. I’m sorry we have to meet under
these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Me too. Believe me.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I know we don’t know each other very
well, but we do have one thing in common, our concern for Steven.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Well, you were right. Something’s happening
with him and he won’t even acknowledge it.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: If he refuses to admit he has a problem,
we may have to let him hit bottom. He’s gonna need some tough love.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You know his lawyer said that nobody named
Ernie Douglas works for the Cable Company.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Did he do a name search? ’Cause I work
under a pseudonym so the customers won’t harass me at home. Kind of like
a stripper. My real name is Larry, Larry Tate.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: And he’s saying he received all the stereo
equipment from you.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: cornered, so he’s telling some wives
tales. He doesn’t mean to hurt me.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I just feel like I triggered this with him.
It’s not that I don’t want to get married, it’s just I felt like he
wanted to get married just to get married. I don’t deal well with
pressure.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hey, welcome to the human race. We’re not
perfect. We all think we have to look like a ‘Baywatch’ babe and be as
witty as ‘Seinfeld.’ Give yourself a break.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: God I could go for turkey and mashed potatoes
now.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Comfort food. Bring it on.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You’ve got a great laugh. Can I make a
small request? I’d like to hear it a little more often.</p>
<p><strong>barry nolan</strong>: The Sam Sweet trial has been thrown
into chaos as a result of a videotape made a month after the killing. In
this “Hard Copy” exclusive an apparently intoxicated Sam Sweet puts on a
macabre show for his friends at a party. The judge has not decided
whether this tape is admissible as evidence.</p>
<p><strong>sam sweet</strong>: Hey everyone. Look it’s me and� my
brother Stan. Hi Stan. It’s so nice to see you. How are you feeling?
Look, he’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>sam sweet</strong>: Now he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>sam sweet</strong>: What? I’m just goofing around.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m sorry dad.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t want to hear it. Do you know the pain
you out your mother through? You’re lucky she didn’t die of a heart
attack.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Just like you said you didn’t steal that
‘X-Men’ comic book when you were eight. Then I found it in your
underwear drawer.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Will you ever stop mentioning that?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: This cost me a lot of money. You jump bail,
and I swear I’ll hire a bounty hunter to hunt you down.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Are you sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You’re not fine. When you say you’re fine, I
know you’re not fine.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I just want to get this over with so I can
go home and get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I wanted you to know I invited your friend.
He was concerned about you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Great. I feel. Bad. I’ve been kind of
blowing Rick off lately.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Not Rick.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You can only come in if you came to
rage.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Is this guy cool? I’m just joshing. Come
on in.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What is he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I invited him.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: When did you invite him?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: At lunch the other day.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: At lunch? You had lunch with him?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Hello. You look great.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: And you are a vision. Hello Steven.
You’re looking rested.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Steven, what’s with you tonight? I’m
getting some really weird energy from you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Maybe it’s because I just got out of prison,
where you sent me. I should just drag you to the police right now.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You can if you like, but I’d hate to have
to show Robin this.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Come on Steven, let’s just have a good
time tonight.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Steven, your mother and I had a long talk with
your friend Larry here when he came over to screw in the cable.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mother</strong>: Thank you again for that.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: We owe you an apology. I didn’t realize the
seriousness of your problems. You’re obviously going through some kind
of personal hell and I need to be more understanding. We didn’t get
involved with things like that when I was your age.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I know we haven’t been there for you lately
but we’re going to see you through this, ’cause we are a family. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mother</strong>: You’ve got a good friend here.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Hey buddy, we’re with you. Keep your chin
up.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: So Steven is carrying this battle ax, and
he’s chasing me, swinging like a mad man. I’m yelling at him, ‘hey, it’s
just a show!’</p>
<p><strong>steven’s sister</strong>: He always takes things too
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Tell me something I don’t know. This guy
almost took my head off.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: It’s from “Goodfellas.” Remember the
intro scene at the bar. I’m Johnny Two Times.</p>
<p><strong>tony/cable guy</strong>: Pow, pow, pow. You’re under
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You’ll never catch me copper.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m gonna wear a disguise.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Oh, you got me.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Aaah!!! Nobody messes with me and
lives!</p>
<p><strong>tony/cable guy</strong>: Booo!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Oh man, you should have seen your face.
It was classic.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Very funny. Tony, go to your mother!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Look what you’ve done.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know you beat up Robin’s date.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I guess I did what you didn’t have the
guts to do.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You stay away from Robin.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Don’t mess with me. I’m feeling like a
part of the family, and I like it. You should try it sometime.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mother</strong>: My, you two look like brothers.
Come on back, we’re all having coffee in the living room.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Are you guys trying to fatten me up?
’Cause if you are, you’re doing a damn good job of it.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You guys have never played “Porno
Password?”</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No, but I like the sound of it.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: It’s the adult version of the popular
television game show. Robin you’re on my team. Steven, you’re with mom.
You’re the audience.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: The password is� vagina.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I really don’t want to play this game.
Woman. Woman.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mother</strong>: Uh� man?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Pe-nis. Pe-nis. Pe-nis.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Peeee-nis. Peeee-nis.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Vagina?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I thought it was going to be schlong!
Whoops.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: The password is� nipple.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Can I pass?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Come on Steven, don’t be a stick in the
mud.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Breast. Breast.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mother</strong>: Tit?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Hard� Hard�</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Erection?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Center. Center.</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mother</strong>: Nipple?</p>
<p><strong>steven’s mother</strong>: I can’t believe I got it. I was
going to say areola.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I wish you did, ’cause we’d be ahead.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: The password is� I’m not sure how to
pronounce this, it’s either clitoris, or clit-oris.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I can’t say that to my mother!</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Hey, she’s a grown woman. She can handle
it.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Come on Steven. We’re just having fun.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No, I’ve had enough. I can’t do this. This
guy is ruining my life, I won’t sit here and play X-rated party games
with him.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Steven, I really think you’re over-
reacting.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I am not over-reacting. You’re all being
fooled by this guy! He’s a felon for Christ sake! I hate you! Get out of
my life!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m sorry everyone. If I am a nuisance, I
will leave. I would never stay where I am not wanted.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: You’re not a nuisance. Please don’t go.
Steven, you’re being an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Yeah, Steven it seems like you’re the one with
the problem.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: What? You have no idea what this guy is
really like.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’ll just go.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: See what I mean!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Steven, what’s with you tonight? Robin
showed me that birthmark on her left shoulder. It’s very sexy.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I can’t believe you.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m fine. Thank you for a delightful
evening. I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I just think you were completely out of line.
I don’t know what’s happening to you these days.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Robin, this guy is a sociopath. He leaves
messages on my machine night and day. He shows up wherever I go. He
won’t leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Sounds familiar.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You know he was the one who beat up your
date at that restaurant. That’s right. And he gave you the free cable.
It wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: But you took the credit for it?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’s what he wanted. He was manipulating
me. It feels so good to be honest about this. We’re finally
communicating. I’ve been wanting to tell you for so long, but he’s been
blackmailing me.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Blackmailing you? How?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: With a photograph.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Me with a… prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: He set it up. He invited this woman to my
party and didn’t tell me she was a prostitute. I’m so glad we can talk
about this.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: When did you have a party?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: When we weren’t communicating. I invited
you. You were out on a date.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: And you were with a prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: She seduced me. That’s what they do. They’re
professionals. And I didn’t even know she was a prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: So that makes it better?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’s not the point. The point is this guy
has been setting me up. He’s responsible.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: He didn’t have sex with a whore. You did.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Robin you don’t –</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I don’t want to hear it. Breaking up was the
best thing we ever did. You have some serious problems, and it’s not my
responsibility to help you. I am only responsible for my own
happiness.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Where did that come from?</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It was Jerry Springer’s “final thought.”</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I’m sorry I’ve been blowing you off.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You bet your ass you’ve been blowing me
off.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: It’s just, this guy is really doing a number
on me.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I told you not to hang out with him.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re the one who told me to offer him
money so I could get free cable.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: You didn’t tell me he was a psychopath. I’ll
see if I can get my friend in research to track him down. What’s his
name again?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Ernie Douglas.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Ernie Douglas? Ernie Douglas? Why does that
sound so familiar?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Did anyone notice I’m late?</p>
<p><strong>joan</strong>: What are you talking about, you’ve been here
for an hour.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Work’s good.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: How’s Hal?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t get me started. That guy has no
vision. It’s like working for Mr. MaGoo. He’s just worthless.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: It’s just great that you’re getting to do it.
It’s a real step up.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I know. Now if only someone at corporate
smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff
done.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Don’t worry. I didn’t see it — ’cause I have no
vision.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Chip! Chip, this isn’t funny! Where are
you?!!!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Leave me alone! I have no job, no
girlfriend, no family anymore! It’s over! You won!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Oh no. It’s not over. It’s just gettin’
started.</p>
<p><strong>mark thompson</strong>: The jury has notified the judge that
they are very close to reaching a verdict, and would like to keep
deliberating into the evening hours.</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: There are five people named Ernie
Douglas in this county. Two are African American. One is eighty-five
years old. One is eleven years old, and the last one is in a
wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: So we’re nowhere. Ernie Douglas? Ernie
Douglas?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Could you stop that?</p>
<p><strong>researcher</strong>: Don’t snap at me. I’m doing this as a
favor.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Wait, could you start that again? Start
tapping your foot again.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Bingo. “My Three Sons.”</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Chip and Ernie Douglas.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I’ve got a list of every cable installer fired
in the last four years. Every one of these guys has the same physical
description as our friend. Murray Slaughter, Brendan Walsh, Sam Malone,
Alex Reiger. There was even a guy who liked to be called ‘the big
Ragu.’</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Carmine from “Laverne and Shirley.”</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: That’s so sad that you know that. Anyway, the
cable company in town fired a guy six months ago named Darren Stevens.
He stole the truck and disappeared. That’s our guy.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: So he doesn’t even work for the Cable
Company?</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: He was fired for beating up a customer who
yelled at him for being late. A company in Denver thinks they might have
a lead on who he really is. If I were you I’d lock down tonight. I’ll
call you when I get some more info.</p>
<p><strong>prosecutor</strong>: Don’t let your memories of these cute
twins distract you from the fact that this funny star of a situation
comedy killed his own brother in cold blood, then called the police and
said he was killed by an Asian gang. There was no laugh-track on that
night.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: This man killed his own brother. Some
people don’t even have a brother…</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: …do they Steven? Are you listening to me?
Don’t shut it off. Don’t shut it –</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why do you keep icing me man?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You owe me!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I just want to hang out. No big deal.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Steven, you’re just like me. We’re cut
from the same cloth. We’re one and the same!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Oh my god. She’s right. I am a smotherer.
I’m just like him.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: It didn’t have to come to this Steven. We
could have been blood brothers.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Rick told me you were fired from The Cable
Company. You’re not even a real cable guy.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Do you feel good now that you’ve hurt me?
Well now I’m going to have to hurt you. I’m going to take away what you
hold dearest in the world.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I swear to God, if you touch –</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Could you hold on a second, I’ve got call
waiting. It’ll just be a sec.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Sorry about that. Where was I? Oh yeah.
You’re going to feel my wrath.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t do this. There must be some way for us
to work this out.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I wish there was. Oh Steven, I’m just so
tired. So very tired.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Let’s talk in person. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m close. So very close.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You know, I don’t think you’re right for
Robin. She needs someone who can be sensitive to her needs. Someone who
understands her soul.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You stay away from her.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Aren’t we the control freak. Looks like
you’re starting to sweat.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I got the camera. You can’t see me.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Oh yeah? Then why are you picking your
face?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You’re getting closer.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Pity, such a nice CD rack. You know
sometimes the answer is right under your nose.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey Rick. I need to meet with you right
away. I’ve got some information about this crazy cable guy.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Me too. I’ve got the whole story.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: That’s great. Let’s meet at the old school
at nine-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Why all the way out there?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I think he’s been following me. Don’t be
late, buddy.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Be home! Be home!</p>
<p><strong>female neighboor</strong>: Go away! I remember you. You’re
her obsessive boyfriend. She said you might come here. I’m calling the
police.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: Steven? Steven?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hey Rick. I’m really excited to hear what
you found out about this nut.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: I hit the Holy Grail. This guy is deeply
troubled. Only child. His mother was arrested for prostitution, and
phone solicitation. Apparently she was some phone sex pioneer.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>rick</strong>: And get this, he was discharged from the
Marines. He got mad at his Sergeant so he sent a weapons silo to Defcon
Two using a Radio Shack computer. And that’s not the half of it.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Really? Tell me more.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m very interested in learning
everything I can about that wacked out cable installer.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: It sounds like he might hurt
somebody.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Nosey friends for two hundred. This
supposed pal of Steven’s is currently residing in the intensive care
unit of Good Samaritan Hospital.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Rick.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m sorry, you didn’t answer in the form
of a question.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Rick Legatos. He’s a friend of mine. Where
is he?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Room 205.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Can I see him?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes. But he can’t speak. He’s in shock.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Ring?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Poor Rick. Seems he had a little accident
with the business end of a staple gun.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re not going to get away with this.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: The question is, are you going to get
away with it? Apparently there was an anonymous tip placed to the police
leading them to a staple gun at the crime scene with your fingerprints
all over it.</p>
<p>****: All right, I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Be right there.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Was that Robin?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’ve got to go. We’re going to take a
romantic stroll on the information superhighway.</p>
<p><strong>officer</strong>: Hey, hold it!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: …it all started in Lansford, Pennsylvania
where Panther Valley Television, with the assistance of Jerrod
Electronics, created the first cable television system.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: The future is now. Soon every American
home will integrate their television, phone, and computer. You’ll be
able to visit the Louvre on one channel, and watch female mud wrestling
on another. You can do your shopping at home, or play a game of Mortal
Kombat with a friend in Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: This is really fascinating, but I really
think we ought to go now.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I knew you’d appreciate it. I took Steven
here once, and he didn’t give a rats ass about my interests.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m worried about Steven.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Maybe Steven should be worried about you.
So, where was I?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Ichabod Crane! The Disney Channel showed
it all last month.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Let’s get ready to
ruuuuuummmmbbble!!!!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Where’s Robin?!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: This isn’t about Robin, this is about you
and me.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Where’s Robin?!!!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Tell me!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’m sorry, I didn’t catch the
question?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Steven you’ve changed. I like it.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I think it’s time to make you cable
ready.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Last time we fought I let you win! Best
two out of three!</p>
<p><strong>music up</strong>: Ominous version of the ‘Star Trek’ battle
music.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You treat me like the TV! You use me, but
you can’t live without me!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You can’t shut me off with your remote
control!!!! I’m not like Robin and Rick and Mommy and Daddy and brother
and sister and cousin –</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I got the point.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Steven.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Help me Steven!</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Steven! Look out!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Yeah Steven. Look out!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: “Dry land is not a myth, I’ve seen it.”
Kevin Costner from Waterworld. I don’t know what the fuss was about, the
movie ruled, I saw it six times.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Isn’t it weird that we’vve wound up in
this position?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Who would have thunk it?</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You’re gonna have to do better than that
Steven. Steven. Hey, my lisp is gone.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You stupid son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: Steven!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: The opposite wire. The Cable Guy’s muddy
hands slam onto it. He pulls himself up.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I know what your saying. Who does this
guy think he is, Jason?</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Stay away from her!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: I saw that in Trapeze, starring Tony
Curtis. He was just on “Life-styles of the Rich and Famous.” He still
looks terrific.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: And the race is on.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: This is such an anti-climactic way to end
this.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: I’m sorry I didn’t believe you. I love
you.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: I love you too. You’re right. We shouldn’t
get married. I’ve got a lot of problems to work out which have
absolutely nothing to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>robin</strong>: We’ll work them out together.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: What just happened? Where am I? Oh yeah,
I was trying to kill you.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: It’s a sleeper hold. Hulk Hogan used it
on Sly Stallone in “Rocky Three.” He should wake up in thirty seconds,
so let’s get going.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Easy.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: It didn’t have to be this way Steven. I’m
just trying to show you the kind of things that can happen when you
mistreat people.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t do anything stupid.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: You know this is just like that secen in
that Clint Eastwood movie “Dirty Harry” –</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: No! This is not like anything! This is not a
movie! We’re real people! You’re hurting us! This is reality!</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: If this is reality… …I am outta here.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Nooo!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Don’t do this. You just need help. We all
get lonely.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Yeah, but I get really lonely. I mean,
look at me.</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: You’re gonna be fine. Just come on up.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Steven, I think I sat too close to the
television. Mommy was right.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: It’s too late for me, but there’s a lot
of little Cable Boys out there who still have a chance. Say good-bye to
the baby- sitter.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: This is the moment America has been
waiting for. We’ve just been told the jury is ready to render their
decision.</p>
<p><strong>court clerk</strong>: By unanimous vote the defendant Sam
Sweet…</p>
<p><strong>court clerk</strong>: …has been found –</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Damn, that hurt like a mother. What the
hell was I thinking? Oh man, that stings.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: A little help here!</p>
<p><strong>steven</strong>: Is he going to be all right?</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: I don’t know. It’s in God’s hands.</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Hang in there buddy. Stay with me. Just
stay with me.</p>
<p><strong>cable guy</strong>: Am I really your buddy?</p>
