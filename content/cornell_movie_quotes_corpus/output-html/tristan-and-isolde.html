<h1 id="tristan-and-isolde">tristan-and-isolde</h1>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: A year younger than I was for my first.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: When can I have a stag?</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: a stag?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Oh come on!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Why would they join up against the
Irish?</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: Because someone has to stand up to them.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: You?</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: Me, Marke, all the tribes. We can�t resist
alone.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I could.</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: Oh my little warrior. We have to be
careful.</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: Come home without something for your Lady
there will be hell to pay.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Can I?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The Angles have arrives my Lord, as well as the
Carrods, our fellow Jutes and the Saxons.</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: Good. With Marke, all will be here.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah. It is a great day.</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: Let us hope so.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lady marke</strong>: We heard the news…</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Mother, I made this for you</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: Friends, look at us.</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: The tribes of Britain. Divided. Weak. Just
as the Irish like us. But if we were one land united, we would out
number them two to one. We could defeat them once and for all. That is
why we are here today, to sign this treaty of unification.</p>
<p><strong>lord</strong>: But who would be King?</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: The strongest among us: Lord Marke.</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: Look if you are happy sending all of your
gold to Ireland, living as slaves then by all means do nothing.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: If we were happy doing that then we would
never have risked coming here.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Friends. My wife is with child, my heart
tells me it is a boy. I want him to grow old in a land where all of us,
all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute, Saxon are at peace. This island
has not known unity since the Romans left. That is why I sign this
treaty.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: And why should we follow you?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Perhaps, Wictred, because your last attempt
to form an alliance without the knowledge of half the Barons in this
room has failed.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: My Lord! The Irish are here!</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: Take all your men. Guard the women!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: But you…</p>
<p><strong>aragon</strong>: Go!!!</p>
<p><strong>lady marke</strong>: Tristan! Hurry! Come this way.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: How did they know?</p>
<p><strong>lady marke</strong>: Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: She�s with the Gods now Isolde, you�ll see
her again someday.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Will I?</p>
<p><strong>henchman</strong>: Morholt returns.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: What news of the treaty?</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Good Morholt, good</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: Your mother loved you so much Isolde</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Why did she die Bragnae? Why?</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: It was an ill fever that took her.
Fever.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: No. It was her heart.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Your husband?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Oh sister I am so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: A whole generation of men.</p>
<p><strong>edyth</strong>: Who�s this?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Tristan. Son of Aragon. We�re his family
now.</p>
<p><strong>edyth</strong>: I have a son about your age. Melot! Melot!
Melot, this is Tristan.</p>
<p><strong>henchman</strong>: What shall we do, my Lord?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Rebuild.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Don�t hold back</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Tristan won�t fight me! Look he�s scared!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Still won’t fight?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Tristan has the heart of a lion.He just
needs some time.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Why did you take off your helmet? You going
to cry? My father died too, but you don�t see me crying!</p>
<p><strong>edyth</strong>: Melot!</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Run! Find another trapdoor to hide under.
Coward!</p>
<p><strong>henchman</strong>: Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Tristan! Tristan! We�ve found something! Come
on, this way.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: You will love it.</p>
<p><strong>simon</strong>: I found a trapdoor!</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: You found a trapdoor? Alright Simon, will you
tell us all how you found it?! Look at that!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Where does this lead?</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: You�ll see. I like that vase, I think I’ll
have that. I always knew the Castle was built on Roman foundations but
we didn�t think anything was left!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Must be a burial crypt or something.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Here we are: the bottom of the keep.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Who else knows about this?</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: The savages have rebuilt the castle at
Cornwall, only now it�s made of stone.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Of Cornwall�s next tribute I want
slaves. Young ones. Their future. If Marke resists have Morholt crush
him.</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: My King.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Morholt.</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: I have led your armies to victory far and
near. I�v made you rich and powerful.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Yes you have. You have been most
loyal.</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: When I return from Cornwall, I was
hoping…</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: What would please you?</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: A wife.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: It�s dark in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: What do you think is really out there?</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: Britannia. The old Roman lands. Full of
evil and grief.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I want to see it. Do you know what the
future looks like Bragnae?</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: I see the life you were meant for. Your
father will speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Am I just a chattel to be traded at your
pleasure? Do I have no say in my own life?</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: You have a duty to your King.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: You are my father.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Then obey me, daughter.</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: Your father has given you the news?</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: And you welcome it?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I accept it.</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: You know, we are more alike than you might
guess.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: I too dabble in elixirs. Poison from the
livers of a puffer fish. Just a taste paralyses all the senses. So if
the blade doesn�t kill…</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Rendered safe by thistle and bark.</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: And you know the antidote for this?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Yohimbine.</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: Makes a hard man even harder. The only
cure… wild abandon. Till out wedding day. I�m to Cornwall, to deal with
rabbles.</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: Release them.</p>
<p><strong>cornish man</strong>: Leave her!</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: Take him there. Get a rope. Any man foolish
enough to interfere in any way shall suffer the same fate.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No! No! Please No!</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: If there are any more attacks we shall put
our guests to death and raise this entire land. Take the horses.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: When would you strike?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: At once. Throw everything we have at
them.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: They are hoping you’ll do that. On horse they
outnumber us two to one. You would lead the men straight to their
deaths.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: So we do nothing?!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Donnchadh would like that even more. Me to
lose face in front of the other tribes. No, we must act. We must be
decisive but we cannot act alone.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: So. Have the good men of York come to fight
with us? Hm? The Saxons of Wessex?</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: My men don�t want to follow a Pict into
battle. Let alone one leading a pack of Angles and Celts.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Then why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: I thought Tristan should let me command his
men.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I make it my habit to follow no one.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: Except Marke.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Marke delivered me from that place when I
was a boy. You ran. So you can understand that when I think of Kings I
think of him. When I think of cowards…</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: They are one day from their boats on the old
Roman road. Now who will ride out with Tristan to fight them?</p>
<p><strong>lord</strong>: What is your plan, Tristan?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: We will need our two fastest runners.</p>
<p><strong>irish man</strong>: Go around!</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: Morholt, they�re back!</p>
<p><strong>morholt</strong>: Kill the slaves!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Simon!</p>
<p><strong>sammy</strong>: I don�t want to die.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I can�t feel my legs or my hands.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Poison.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Build a second boat.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: He shall have a King’s service.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Farewell, Tristan of Aragon. Death of the
Irish.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: When the Irish came to Cornwall and my father
surrendered. You spared a dozen out of a hundred. I am even less kind.
The leader and 3 shall take this message home. As for the rest…</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Victory.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Tristan?</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Simon too.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Did I love him like a son or did I misuse him
for my own purposes?</p>
<p><strong>edyth</strong>: He knew. He knew.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Away.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: You’re afflicted child. Speak to me! Your
father will find us and have my head. You are my charge. Please!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I am no ones charge!</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: You are. And you will be Morholt�s
Lady!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: And live a loveless life like my mam?</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: What�s that?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: Isolde. Wait! Don�t! Isolde. Don�t!
Isolde!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: It�s a man.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: Dead?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Alive! Bragnae help me!</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: Isolde?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Help me!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Start a fire! Quickly!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: His heart falters.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: He needs heat. Now! Get your clothes off!
Quickly!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Hurry! Quickly! Smell that? Smell the
poison? When he warms we will need thistle and bark.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: I�ve not been naked with a man for 15
years!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Hello. You’ve been sleeping a long time.
You’re in Ireland. Did you know that? Shh… It’s alright. You’re safe
here. No one knows. Don’t be scared. Just sleep… sleep.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: Nooo Nooo Noo!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: It�s alright, you don�t need that! I forgot
to tell him about you…</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: I�ll wait outside with the other
beasts.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: You said no one else knew.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Sorry… She�s… My maid. Sworn to silence. Um…
lie down please. Please?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: It�s good you are remembering things. This
might sting. Do you remember anything else? The boat I found you in? How
you got this? Too many questions. Here keep it dry. Here I found bread,
you have water and fire. The ocean is outside if you wish a bath. You
won�t know where you are going so please don�t try to leave. Just trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I�ll be back</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: This is a dangerous game you are playing.
He�s English, Isolde.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Then we�ve got him prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: Under no circumstances tell him your name,
you hear me? Not if you wish him to escape this place. Do you hear
me?</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: You�ve been away.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I had noticed. Yes I have a bit.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Bragnae and I were spying the convent of
Brittes ].</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Seeking sanctuary?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Some women need it.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: You�ll find no refuge in a new
religion. Your place is here, with Morholt.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Any word of my betrothed?</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Overdue. But comforted no doubt that
you yearn for him.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Oh, I think it’s better if we don’t bother
with names.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: How can I thank you if I don’t have your
name?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: You just did. If you insist… my name is
Bragnae. I’m a lady in waiting at the court. My parents are dead. My
mother, she is the source of the kindness you find so puzzling. My
father would’ve left you where you fell.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Tristan of Aragon.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Well Tristan of Aragon, I’d guess about you
too, but I think I’ve already seen everything.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: Sir! I hope you appreciate the risks we are
taking, and will honour us by leaving as soon as you are able.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: She likes me. She�s right though, you do
risk.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: There. What of your parents?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: They also died when I was a child.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: A different type of Irish kindness.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Tomorrow then?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: There she who bore you brought you
forth.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I happen to believe what that says. Don�t
you think there is more to life?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Than what?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Something more than duty and death! Why are
we capable of feelings if not to have them? Why long for things if they
are not meant to be ours? Well don�t listen to me. You�re so sure of
things. You�re certainty, it�s like armour. I wish I had that.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Why would you need it?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: The joy of being a lady? Wanting something I
can�t have. A life of my own.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: Time for sleep now.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I�ll follow you later.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: You need to rest. In case your betrothed
should want to see you.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: You�re promised?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: What�s he like?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Dark. Tall. Nearly twice your size. An
absolute gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I thought… earlier when you spoke of
wanting something you can�t have.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I didn�t know what I was talking about.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Outside, just past that bluff there is a
boat. That�s how you should go when you leave. You should go soon.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I don�t know</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Tristan! They�ve found your boat. At this
very moment the King himself is scouring the coast. He will find you. He
finds everyone. The tide is coming let�s go!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Come with me. Come with me!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I can�t</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Why not? Please!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Tristan, we�ve both known this can�t be.
We�ve known this from the start. That doesn�t mean it isn�t true. It is.
It just cannot be. I want to know that you are alive somewhere thinking
of me from time to time. I want to know that there is more to this life
and I can�t know that if they kill you. Please?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: A Cornish warrior may be ashore.
Beware. We seek him as I speak. Hopefully it is just his rotted corpse
we’ll find, for he has slain your betrothed. Morholt is dead. Fallen in
battle. Isolde? Bragnae, comfort her.</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: She�s stunned.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: As am I by her grief.</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: We should assulat the British straight away.
Crush them with maximum force.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Maximum force. Like that of Marke�s
tribe with the maximum force you speak of? I will not confront them
again until our numbers are refreshed. Until then, we�ll have cunning
divide them.</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: Of what nature?</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: A prize, perhaps.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: What�s this about a tournament?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Donnchadh. He has offered his daughter and
the lands of Lyonesse as dowry to whichever English tribe wins. It is a
clever way of setting us against each other.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Well, the other barons will see through
that.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: As baron of Wessex it is my duty to fight
in this tournament for my people.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: For yourself you mean.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: And what of the support you promised
Tristan?</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: Tristan is dead. My people have suffered
enough. They see the wealth of Lyonesse as more real than any alliance.
My mind is set.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: And ours as well.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: So be it.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: You’re weary, let me rally your friends. I�ll
lead them against D…</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Ah, Melot, Melot, Melot. You are my blood and
you are a noble presence but……</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Lord Marke! He�s back! It�s Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It cannot be!</p>
<p><strong>edyth</strong>: Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: I saw you dead.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I am delivered.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: How? How?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: A toast! Tristan! Back from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Tristan. The Irish King offers his daughter in
tournament to divide the tribes. For the power and the wealth half the
tribes have sent champions to fight at the… Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: God knows what happened to him.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: “My face in thine eyes, thine in mine
appears,</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: It is the only way to keep the alliance
alive.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: I fail to see how fighting with our partners
keeps us allies.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Well they are all going to the tournament
anyway. By announcing you will share the dowry with every Baron that
remains loyal and in turn offering to support whomever prevails, the
others would be compelled to follow you when you win.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: If we win. If we lose we could end up
following Wictred. I�d need an infallible champion!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Me.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: You are not yet healed.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Then this trip will be my tonic. I will be
ready. I know I will.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: What is the source of this fervour?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Let me go and win you a wife. She can make
peace without spilling one drop of blood, and maybe heal a wound from
which you still lack.</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: Truce. You have safe passage.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>henchman</strong>: How do you look?</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Where is this Princess? What�s her name?
Isolde? I want to see what she looks like.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: There. Almost done.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: No, not quite. If I am to be a present I
should be fully wrapped.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: See how the bees come to the
honey.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Tristan of Aragon.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: So he lives.</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: For the moment.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: Wictred of Glastonbury.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: I fight with no champion in my stead. Know
that.</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: Why Wictred?</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Because the Barons will never unite
behind him.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Do you think she�s got the pox?</p>
<p><strong>herald</strong>: Since the dawn of time…</p>
<p><strong>herald</strong>: … Begin!</p>
<p><strong>wictred�s opponent</strong>: Make it for real!</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>wictred�s opponent</strong>: I yield!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: You were great!</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Allow it!</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: It was too easy for you Tristan. Not much for
a third draw.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: Mace.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: One more fight Tristan. Take deep
breaths.</p>
<p><strong>herald</strong>: Wictred: Lord of Saxonberg. Tristan:
Champion of Cornwall. Warriors: Begin!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Yield!</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: An impressive victory. Of course the
man who defeats Morholt might be expected to triumph here.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: On behalf of Cornwall, I offer your
daughter a place on our throne. The throne of England, united behind one
leader.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Isolde! Perhaps it is just that he
who took a husband provides one.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I�m yours.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: No. Tristan of Aragon has won you on
behalf of Lord Marke of Cornwall.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Let�s go.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Let them take her across the sea.
After the wedding I’ll disavow Isolde, the alliance will crumble.</p>
<p><strong>henchman</strong>: Tristan. Princess wants to speak to
you.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: You risked your life to give me to another
man.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: You said your name was Bragnae. Why did you
do that?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Oh what have I done? Stop this thing. Say
something.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I can’t. I won you in my King’s name.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: But I am yours. You touched me and I
yielded…</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: It is the only thing that matters Tristan.
Leave with me, I will go anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Your marriage will end a hundred years of
bloodshed.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: My marriage to another man!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Isolde. You will live with this. We
must.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Don’t do this to me.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Tristan, we�ve made shore.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: What if she�s a hag? Or maybe she won�t have
me!</p>
<p><strong>edyth</strong>: She will brother. You�re the prize.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: My Lord.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Isolde? Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: If things were different. If we lived in a
place without duty… would you be with me?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: That place does not exist.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I’ll pretend it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: You�re trembling. You are far from home and I
am a stranger still. But you mustn�t fear me. My wish is to make you
happy, as a wife.. as a women and hopefully one day, the fact that I am
not whole will not offend you.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: That�s pretty. Did you make it?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: It was a present.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Tristan?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Might I stay here a while?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>edyth</strong>: Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: I�ve never seen him like this before.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Perhaps someone his own age should speak
with him.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: They believe you are distant. They are
worried about you. So am I.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I can tell. Laughing at the market, holding
hands, a caress on the neck when he pours you wine.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: He is my husband. I remember his Kingdom
comes before my life.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Yes well, I must confess I thought you
might find more difficulties in performing your duty.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Am I not permitted a single moment without
mourning? Living with this Tristan as you said we must.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I live in torture thinking of these
moments. With every look he gives you I get sicker and sicker. There is
a burning in me, I feel on fire and guilt and I can’t get rid of either.
Does it make you happy to know that?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: The Roman Bridge. I can get to it without
being seen. And I will go there anytime to be there with you.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Welcome bands of Anglia, Rothgar and Orick.
Wessex: Kaye and Wictred.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: As you will be King and his daughter Queen,
does that mean Donnchadh will be coming to the coronation.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: It does. On the next full moon, all will
attend.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: A lot can happen in a month</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Bearing that in mind, and given the
instabilities of our new land I shall be naming a second. My sister has
raised one, capable of guiding you if the need should arise. He is a man
of passion, fierce in battle who has learnt to tame his heart with his
head. I give you Tristan of Aragon.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: For the first time since the Romans, this
country stands united.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I can�t be your second. Melot must be. He
is blood. Besides, I wish to journey north.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: You no longer sleep at Dor, and now you don�t
want to be my second. Do you find no comfort in your home? These stone
walls that you helped build?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I find these walls a prison.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Everything I want seems misplaced.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Ever since you were a boy you sacrificed
everything for me. All for one dream. Now that you reached that dream,
it is natural that you would feel some loss. It doesn�t matter if you
want to be second. You are. I will only be king if you are my second.
I�d put it more gently if I could.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Then I am your second.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Perhaps it is time that you took a wife!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Can�t live alone forever.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I can!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Isolde. I was trying to explain to Tristan
the importance of loving. It seems he might live without it.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: There are other things to live for. Duty.
Honour.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: But they are not life Tristan. They are the
shells of life. And empty ones and in the end all they hold is days and
days without love. Love is made by God. Ignore it and you can suffer as
you cannot imagine.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Then I will no longer live without it.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Good. Very good! Come, we will be late!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Late?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: The warriors ride out on the full moon. It is
an old ritual. I shall miss you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: How many did you love before me?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: And after me?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Lord Marke! Are you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Nothing but for my pride.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Tristan, I need to speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: We haven�t even had a coronation yet to mark
tradition. But now he breaks tradition and scares all the barons by
naming you as second.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I tried to convince him you would be
better.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Yes well, peace can be just as treacherous as
war and I feel that Marke doesn�t really…Listen to me!!! Our attention
must be on Cornwall now more than ever.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I am sorry he didn�t choose you. I am.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Can I speak to you?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: What do you think became of them?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: They were lives… just lived.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I find myself imaging things in this place.
I decorate it. Books, a harp there… a child.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Would it be his or mine?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I would have no way to tell, would I? He is
a kind man Tristan, I cannot hate him. Yesterday at the market I saw a
couple holding hands, and I realised we would never do that. Never
anything like it. No picnics or unguarded smiles. No rings. Just stolen
moments that leave too quickly.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Where is Isolde?</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: I don�t know for sure, she was having a
walk in the garden before and I�m afraid I got tired so I returned. It�s
my fault.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: You�re going to get caught! Both of you!
He�s looking for you right now, he�ll see you! I told you this would
happen!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: There is another door here, forgotten. This
comes up in the bottom chamber of the keep.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I hate this.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Hurry! Go on.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: I�m tired of this. I�m tired of lying for
you. I�m sick of it.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Then don�t.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: There is a servings child, quite ill. Doing
better now.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: I didn�t ask you were you were. Your heart is
beating so fast.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Isolde. Is there anything I can do to make
you happier. I want to make you happy.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I�m fine.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: She�s in love with Tristan. They�re
intimates. If I expose them it will break Marke�s heart and his hold on
the other Barons.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: With Marke�s champion in chains, we�ll take
Castle Dor. You can man your armies unopposed. There will be no one
defending you in the waters.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: And your price?</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: I want Marke�s throne.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: When his throne falls apart, we�ll
go over and pick up the pieces.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Tristan? Can I speak with you? Is it
possible… do you think a man blinded by love… Is it possible that that
man might not see treachery right in front of him?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Perhaps you could follow her. I can�t ask
anyone else. I know. I know what you think � I�m acting like a child.
Normally I can read faces, but with hers I feel like… I can’t be
objective. She�s so delicate.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: You really love her.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Oh… I do…terribly. I didn�t know how empty I
was. She sustains me, she thrills me. And when I see this ring, it is a
ring of thorns.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: The ring is nothing. She’s loyal to you. I
am sure of it.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: … If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I count nine</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: If they move they will warn us with a black
flag</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: You bring an entourage?</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: I can let myself be alone in my
position Lord Marke. But don�t worry, they will stay offshore. I miss
you.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: My nephew, Merlot of Cornwall</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: And Tristan, slayer of my best
general, winner of Isolde, defender of the alliance. You are a fortunate
man.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Indeed.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Tristan! Seems I worried for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: May I dance with the Queen, or does Tristan
have the next one?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: That�s right, you have never danced with
Isolde before!</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: A new song for Tristan. Slow.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Why did you burn it?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: You know.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Meet me there in an hour or I�ll die.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: I could still teach you a thing or two,
dancing being one of them.</p>
<p><strong>kaye</strong>: Accuse him now.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: No, no, no. We�ll have more than
accusations.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Is something the matter?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I�m just feeling a little weary that�s all.
I might just go and have a lie down.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: Friends, friends hear me! We�ve forgotten
the full moon isn�t it time to ride out?</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: No. Tonight it cause for exception.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: But the coronation should uphold tradition,
surely it is not to be neglected already?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: We honour it. In half a night. Ride out!
Where�s Tristan?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I miss Ireland</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Isolde, this must end.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: That�s like asking me to stop breathing.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: It cannot be.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Please don�t leave me. Please!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Isolde? There is someone… No.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: I see how it is in Cornwall. My
money is good enough, my alliance is good enough, but my daughter you
pass amoung your lieutenants like a whore!</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: It�s not like that.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: I see no relation to me here! I will
see this peace end.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: You have brought the allegiance to shame.
Who would fight for this?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Seize him. Seize him.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Behold your hero uncle I would have no heroes
now.</p>
<p><strong>bodkin</strong>: They�re ashore.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Prove your worth.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: If a man can�t rule his woman, how can he
govern an entire Kingdom?</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: He can�t.</p>
<p><strong>lord</strong>: We have suffered peace.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: It�s all been coming apart. I can feel it</p>
<p><strong>lord</strong>: You�re right.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: There is very little time. Fortunately,
Donnchadh has no quarrel with anybody here. He�s asked me to give you a
message.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: What�s this?</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: It is compensation for the men you will
lose attacking Castle Dor with Donnchadh tomorrow. Let�s be honest, our
people need a stronger leader.</p>
<p><strong>baron</strong>: And who might that be, Wictred?</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: Melot. Too long the ablest amoung us has
been denied his rightful place. I pledge you my legiance and offer him
my services as his second.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: I like this plan.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: I came to apologise. I�ve been selfish
arrogantly thinking that perhaps I�d given enough. At least enough to
merit if not your love then at least your respect. You have a home. A
kingdom. Why was it not enough? Tell me. Tell me! You do not know what
you have done! Everything is destroyed, everything! All because you did
not have enough. She�s loyal to you I am sure of it. You bloodsucker.
What could it had been had I not stretched out my hand to save your
life. How I curse that day, how I curse it. And so be with your defence.
Then I will go complete your punishment, Donnchadh marches on us as we
speak.</p>
<p><strong>bragnae</strong>: She�s young. I will not let you harm
her!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Since you thought he was dead. I found him
wounded on the beach in Ireland. I hid him from my father and I told him
my name was Bragnae. So when he came to the tournament at Dunluce to win
Donnchadh�s daughter he didn�t realise it was me. All this time my heart
has been his, and I am sorry. He tried harder than you can possibly
imagine because he loves you.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: I will coax him out, make sure Donnchadh
knows this.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: Of course, of course. You know as things
moved along I suspected them for some time.</p>
<p><strong>merlot</strong>: Tristan and Isolde?</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: You know what I could never work out? How
it was conducted. How she got in and out of Dor unseen.</p>
<p><strong>merlot</strong>: The tunnel.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>merlot</strong>: The Roman Tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>henchman</strong>: The will of the King. Farwell.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: I told him about Ireland. He�s given us our
freedom. Why does loving you feel so wrong?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Tristan, if I do this.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: For all time, they will say it was our love
that brought down a kingdom. Remember us.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Tristan, don�t! Tristan! Tristan! Tristan!
Why?! Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Get the livestock and fuel undercover. Put
some archers on the ramparts.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: All the archers have deserted us as has
half the household.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: And you stay?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: If you are surprised then they have won
already.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Come on, hurry!</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Burn it. Their will is as strong as
milk. The seas will unravel us. Where is Wictred with his key?</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: It comes up to the Roman foundations at the
lowest level.</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: This is a godsend!</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: What will you say to him?</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: That he will not make any more mistakes and
that it is time for him to move ba � what�s that?!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Aim for the front of the line</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: They are waiting.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: The Irish are inside!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Follow me!</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: Bar the door make sure no one gets in!</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: You.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: A reward for idiocy. A dozen Irish have
blazed your way.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Melot, I came to aid Marke.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Everyone lies.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: I didn�t lead them here.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: No, I did.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: I thought someone believed in me.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: It will be undone.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Tristan�I�m for the worms�swear to me that
you are true.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: As we were brothers.</p>
<p><strong>melot</strong>: Build my boat.</p>
<p><strong>wictreds man</strong>: They�re here!</p>
<p><strong>wictred</strong>: Keep them back.</p>
<p><strong>marke�s man</strong>: Wictred.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: He�s trying to lower the bridge</p>
<p><strong>marke�s man</strong>: Traitor!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Give me your shield, we�re pinned down!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>marke�s man</strong>: Him too?</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: No, he�s with us!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Tristan!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Tristan! How did you get here?</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Secret. Secrets, in the bowls of the
keep.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: In the bowls of the keep.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: They have reached the palisades.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Then we must keep hope.</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Get back! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Behold! The head of a traitor!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Will you always be little men, who cannot see
what was and could be again? There is no middle ground! So slay us or
slay him!</p>
<p><strong>king donnchadh</strong>: Oblidge them. Oblidge them!</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: Take me out of here. Take me to the
river.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: Bring her.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Marke, you must come, the battle needs you.
We�ll lose everything.</p>
<p><strong>marke</strong>: I must heed their call, I am the King.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: We�ve driven them back as far as we can but
they are holding us at the throat.</p>
<p><strong>general</strong>: Goodbye my friend.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: Know that I love you Tristan. And wherever
you go, whatever you see, I will always be with you.</p>
<p><strong>tristan</strong>: You were right. I do not know if life is
greater than death, but love was more than either.</p>
<p><strong>isolde</strong>: “My face in thine eyes, thine in mine
appears,</p>
