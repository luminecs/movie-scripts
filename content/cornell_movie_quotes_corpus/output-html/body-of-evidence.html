<h1 id="body-of-evidence">body-of-evidence</h1>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Is it Marsh?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Sir, do you mind if we get out of the
rain?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Who found him?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: His Secretary. Joanne Braslow.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: She was here?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: No. She stopped by to pick up some
papers.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: About three hours.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Cause?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: Not sure. I’ll have everything you need
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>troxell</strong>: This guy was into some kinky shit.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Miss Braslow – I’m District Attorney John
Cardenas. You arrived at what time tonight?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: A little after eleven.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Why did you come by?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I had some papers to pick up.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Do you know who Mr. Marsh was with?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I assume his girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Her name?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Rebecca Lawson.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: You wouldn’t know her address, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: No – but I can get it for you.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: Marsh wasn’t alone. We found traces of
sperm on the sheets. The toxicology report says there were high levels
of cocaine in his blood.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What’d he die of?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: The official cause of death was a cardiac
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: The official cause?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: That’s what my report will read.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: But there’s more?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: It’s speculative at this point. Marsh had
advanced Arterial disease. His heart attack was induced by excessive
aerobic activity – in conjunction with the drug.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What are you saying, Henry? That his
girlfriend fucked him to death?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What can we prove?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: We know Marsh had a head cold. We found
cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand.
The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant,
but for a much shorter time. He’d keep using more and more – never
knowing what he was taking.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Any prints on the nasal spray?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Marsh’s and Rebecca Lawson’s.</p>
<p><strong>troxell</strong>: What if he did know what was in it? A lot
of users put it in nasal spray bottles so they can use it in public.</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: Cocaine is the last thing a man in his
condition would want.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Can we put Rebecca Lawson at the
scene?</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: A man across the street from Marsh saw her
drive up about four thirty Sunday afternoon. And her prints are all over
the place.</p>
<p><strong>troxell</strong>: Marsh’s Cardiologist told me that after
Marsh was diagnosed with heart disease he quit smoking, quit drinking
and started exercising every day. Does that sound like a guy who’d start
shoveling cocaine up his nose?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What did he say about Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>troxell</strong>: He can remember at least one occasion – and
the receptionist can recall two times when she accompanied Marsh to the
office.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: So she knew about his heart?</p>
<p><strong>troxell</strong>: Had to. I also interviewed three women who
were in past relationships with Marsh. There’s no evidence that he had
anything but straight sex prior to meeting Miss Lawson.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What about the will?</p>
<p><strong>troxell</strong>: That’s the best part. She gets it all –
everything.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: I’m District Attorney, John Cardenas.</p>
<p><strong>sattler</strong>: I don’t think that this is the time, or the
place.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: I just wanted to introduce myself and
inform Miss Lawson that there will be an inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>sattler</strong>: An inquiry into what?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: For starters I’d like to know why she left
the house and didn’t report the death?</p>
<p><strong>sattler</strong>: Because he wasn’t dead when she left, and
even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn’t
a crime.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did I say it was a natural death?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You’re on vacation, remember? You’re
supposed to be relaxing.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I am relaxing.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: This is not relaxing.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: And I suppose you’re going to show me how
to relax?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: If you want me to.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m always open to learning new things.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m beginning to see what you mean. Why
don’t we go upstairs and work on the advanced course?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I can’t. I’ve got to finish a counter offer
on the Bergman property.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Can’t it wait?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: No – it has to be done by tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Hey, Slugger. Ready for bed?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Uh huh.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Hello?… Hi Raymond…. What?… Well, I was
sort of planning on… Alright… Okay, goodbye. That was Sattler. He thinks
the D.A.’s going to file on Rebecca Lawson. He wants me in the office
tomorrow morning.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: We’re supposed to go to the lake.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I know. What can I do? He is the boss.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: He could let you have your vacation.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Dad – is it true what they’re saying about
that Miss Lawson Lady?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What are they saying?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh
to death.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Hey, you know better than that. What did I
teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: She allegedly humped him to death?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I swear – the both of you. Some example you
set.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Some example you set.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A
trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.</p>
<p><strong>sattler</strong>: We’ve already got press arriving from over
the country and she hasn’t even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see
her in his office tomorrow at ten. I’d like you to go with her.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m supposed to be on vacation.</p>
<p><strong>sattler</strong>: I know – but she wants you to represent her
if Cardenas files.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>sattler</strong>: Because I told her you were the best
criminal attorney we have.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Raymond, I’m the only criminal attorney you
have.</p>
<p><strong>sattler</strong>: Well, I guess that makes you the best.
Look, Frank – she stands to inherit three million dollars. As executors
of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees
for us. All I’m asking you to do is talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Alright, I’ll talk to her</p>
<p><strong>sattler</strong>: She’s waiting in the conference room.</p>
<p><strong>sattler</strong>: You know, I knew Andrew Marsh for almost
twenty years – or thought I did. What do you think would make a man in
his condition do the things he did?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I think the question is: What is it about
her that made him want to do it?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Miss Lawson, I’m Frank Dulaney.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Are you going to represent me?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: There are no charges against you. I’m here
to decide if I’m going to represent you should that occur. Did you kill
him?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You don’t waste any time, do you?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Do you think I did it?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I don’t know. That’s why I’m asking
you.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You must have some feeling. Some immediate
impression. A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who
leaves her everything in his will. And the things that went on in that
house. Such wild sex. What kind of picture does that paint?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Not a very good one I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: And that’s exactly what the jury will see
when they look at me. That’s why I need a very good lawyer,
Mr. Dulaney.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You’re assuming the District Attorney is
going to file charges.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: He’ll file. He’s an ambitious man.
Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You still haven’t answered my question.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I loved him. A big part of my life has been
torn away from me, Mr. Dulaney. A part I can never get back – and on top
of that people are saying that I am somehow responsible for it. They’ve
taken everything that is good and caring about two people in love and
made it dirty.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No – I didn’t kill him.</p>
<p><strong>troxell</strong>: I think I’m going to make your day.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>troxell</strong>: I’ve got this guy in my office. Doctor Alan
Paley. Wait until you hear what he has to say.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: How can Cardenas possibly think he can build
a case against two consenting adults?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: He must have something or he wouldn’t be
pressing so hard.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: If he files are you going to take the
case?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I don’t know yet. I want to hear what she
says at her statement tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: What’s she like?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Attractive. Bright. Distant. Charming when
she wants to be.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: She sounds like quite a woman.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Yeah – but can she cook?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: The whole thing gives me the creeps. I mean
– what if she really humped him to death?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Humped</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I can think of worse ways to go–</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: –and speaking of humping.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I didn’t know that Andrew was dead until
Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: We have a witness who saw you go into the
house at four thirty.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: She’s not denying she was there.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Did you have sex?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: What time did you leave?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Six thirty – and he was very much
alive.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Miss Lawson, do you use cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I have.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did you use it the night Marsh died?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No. I haven’t done it in years.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Did Marsh use it?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No – never.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: It had to get there somehow.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It didn’t get there from me.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Were you aware of Mr. Marsh’s heart
condition?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Mr. Marsh’s Cardiologist and his nurse
have told us that you accompanied Mr. Marsh to their office on at least
two occasions.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: That’s correct – but Andrew never told me
he had a heart condition. He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was
nothing serious.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: He never mentioned his heart disease?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: She just said that.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Why do you think he lied to you?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: That’s something only Marsh would know.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: I think Miss Lawson knew it too. I think she
slipped him the coke and he popped his cork giving her the high-
hard-one.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: That’s it. My client doesn’t have to take
this crap from you.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Sit down, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: No. Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to
answer your questions. She doesn’t have to sit here and be insulted. So,
either you charge her now or we’re leaving.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: Rebecca Lawson, you’re under arrest for the
murder of Andrew Marsh.</p>
<p><strong>reese</strong>: You have the right to remain silent. If you
give up–</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: I don’t think the handcuffs will be
necessary. You can finish giving Miss Lawson her rights outside.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Frank!</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’ll have you out in a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Lookin’ to make the papers, John?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Marsh left her close to three million
dollars in his will. That’s motive. She admits to being there the night
of his death. That’s opportunity – and her fingerprints are on the nasal
spray bottle.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You can’t show intent.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Can you?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Take your pole out of the water, Frank.
The fish ain’t biting today.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You’re bluffing. John, it’s me, remember?
I’ve known you since your name was Juan Carlos.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: C’mon – think about it. If she was going to
kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to
find?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: She planned this. She wanted us to find
the nasal spray.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Why would she want that?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Because she’s clever. Because she knows
that even if we didn’t find it we’d have suspicions as to why a man in
Marsh’s condition would use cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Suspicions maybe – but suspicions aren’t
enough for a conviction.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: The M.E.’s report stated that Marsh’s
nasal membranes showed no sign of prior cocaine use. Without the nasal
spray we would have still treated it as a poisoning. We would have
looked for motive and the trail would have still led back to her.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I don’t buy it and neither will a jury.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: We’re going all the way on this one,
Frank. Tell your client she has until the prelim to cop a plea for
murder two – fifteen to twenty five.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’ll tell her but she won’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Then she’s not as smart as I thought she
was. You’ve seen her in the depositions. Tell me you don’t have any
doubts?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: She’s innocent.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Aren’t they all?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Yeah. Well – we’ll let the blindfolded lady
with the scales decide that.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I want you to know right now that the
trial’s going to be nasty. Your sex life is going to be dragged through
the mud. They’re going to say that you enticed Marsh – led him down a
dark path.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Andrew hardly needed leading. He was a very
passionate man. He was eager to explore. I gave him what he wanted. We
fulfilled each others needs.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: This is a very small town – people here
have very straight views on sex.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m used to being on the outside looking
in. The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my
sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little
hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Those same men will be sitting on the
jury.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I am who I am. I can’t deny it, anymore
than you can deny who you are. I like sex different – I like it wild.
That’s not a crime. I loved Andrew. We made love together. We made it
differently, but we still made love. It was our way. It was private –
and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of
justice. If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week
do you think this would be happening to me?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Have you ever seen animals make love,
Mr. Dulaney? They have such passion – such savage emotion. They
struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other. Not
really.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: No pain, no gain?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: We’re not animals.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Of course we are. Our primal urges are
still there – but we’ve taken sex and intellectualized it, refined it
down to its most essential components. It’s bland, easy, mechanical.
There’s great passion in the struggle – such craving in denial. Do you
know what it’s like to yearn for something? I’m not talking about
wanting, or needing. I’m talking about an urge so deep that your skin
burns and every cell in your body pulses with desire?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I think we’re getting a little off the
subject here.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I thought the subject was sex?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: As it pertains to you – not me. Did you
always know you had different… tastes?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I don’t know if it’s something I can
explain to you.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Because – it’s beyond intellect. It’s
emotion. It’s passion. It has to be experienced – it can’t be
imagined.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Try.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: When I was growing up we had a strawberry
patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road. I used to sneak
in their yard and steal their strawberries. It wasn’t easy. The stone
walls were high and I’d scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other
side were wild rose bushes. The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my
thighs as I lowered myself down.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: If you had what you wanted at home why did
you sneak into their yard?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Because – somehow the fruit always tasted
that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Albert’s got the stomach flu.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No, it’s not. Now I get to pitch.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Michael, you shouldn’t be happy when someone
else isn’t feeling well.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Not even if they’re a dork?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Not even if they’re a dork. You should go by
and see how he’s feeling.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: No way. Jerry Milner stopped by and Albert
puked right in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Don’t use language like that at the dinner
table.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Frank – I know you’re busy, but Michael
asked me after dinner if you were angry with him. He wanted to know why
you weren’t talking to him.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’ll talk to him later.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why don’t you talk to him now?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I’ve
got a lot of preparing to do.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: No one’s asking you not to work. I just
think you could make some time for your son.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m sorry if it looks like I’m not paying
attention to you lately.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You know how it is sometimes when you’re
out playing ball with your friends? How you’re really concentrating on
what you’re doing – and you lose track of time and you come home late
and Mom yells at you?</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Well, that’s kind of how I am right
now.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Is Mom yelling at you too?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Yeah – a little.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I love you too, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: How you doin’ Mister D?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Fine, Charlie. You familiar with the Marsh
case?</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: Yeah – I hear they had ’em a real dog and
pony show going on up there - - I’ll tell you, sometimes white people
are a real puzzle to me. I mean, did this old guy really think he was
gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: It could’ve happened to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: I’m sorry, man – but I ain’t ever heard of no
brother dying from gettin’ too much pussy.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: We have to find out who else would profit
from Marsh’s death – and who knew enough about his personal life to know
that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: So – where do we start?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I want you to hit all the dealers in town.
Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use.
Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley. He lives up in
Roseburg.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mister Dulaney, I have Rebecca Lawson on
one.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Hi… No, I don’t… One o’clock is fine…
Alright La Brasa… Bye.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: La Brasa?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m taking a client to lunch. Where should
I go, Taco Bell?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: How’d you meet Marsh?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I was at a cocktail party. Very trendy.
Andrew was in Chicago on business. He had broken his wrist the week
before and was wearing it in a sling. He looked so helpless.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: – And then?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: We started talking. In fact, we talked
until four in the morning. We discovered we shared a lot of the same
interests. After that we were together all the time until he left. He
used to call me every night after he came back. Then after a few weeks
he invited me to come visit him. I’ve never left.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Why didn’t you live together?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Andrew was worried about how it would
look.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Can we get out of here?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Sure. Where to?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: This is your house.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I don’t think this is a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Because, I’m your attorney. I shouldn’t be
going to your house.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Is it against the law?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: No – it just doesn’t look right.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No one’s looking.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I think the photographer’s probably a
voyeur.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m the photographer.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Oh – Well, they’re different.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: That’s not an answer.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: It’s not my taste.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Tastes can change.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Not true. Shall I tell you what you were
thinking? You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my
skirt.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Sorry. I wasn’t trying to embarrass
you.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Yes you were.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: –he said it might be too expensive to add
another room. He suggested we might convert the garage into a guest
room. He’s going to check with the contractor and let me know. I’ll let
you know how much and we can decide. Alright?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Is that alright, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Yeah – fine. Excuse me. I’ll be right
back.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Hi. It’s Frank.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Hi, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I just wanted to see if my secretary called
to confirm your appointment tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Yes – she did.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Great. I’ll see you at the office at
nine.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No – not at the office. I’ve got a better
idea.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I figured if we have to talk all day we
might as well do it someplace nice.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Andrew loved this old cabin. He always
dreamed about moving to Tahiti – living in a hut and becoming a
beach-bum. I could never imagine myself doing that – but somehow when he
talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful. Soft ocean
breezes and beautiful sunsets – leaving the world and it’s problems
behind. I wish he’d had a chance to do it.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Tell me about Doctor Paley?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I hardly know him. He wanted me and he
couldn’t have me.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: It’s going to be hard to convince a jury
that he’s testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him
off.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It won’t be that hard.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Did you always want to be a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: No – I wanted to be a professional hockey
player.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: That seems so far away from who you are
now. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I broke my ankle skating. That ended that
dream.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It’s hard to let go of a dream, isn’t it?
To let go of what you want?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m going to put the car away. You can let
yourself in. There’s a key under the flower pot.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Yes – it would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What would?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You and me – making love.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Is that what you think I was thinking?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No – that’s what I know you were
thinking.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: How often do you make love to your wife,
Frank? Once a week? Sometimes twice? There once was passion, wasn’t
there? But now it’s bland, predictable. Tell me, when you do it – do you
always think of her? Or do you wonder what it would be like to be with
someone else? Someone wild. Someone who would force you to lose
control.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: There’s nothing wrong in admitting that you
want me, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You take a lot for granted.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Please stay, Frank. I don’t want to be
alone. I don’t expect anything from you – no demands – no complications.
I just need to feel close to someone.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’ll be back in a minute. Help yourself to
a drink.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: My way.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: My way.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: Before you ask there’s nothing new on the
coke.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You’ve got to get me something I can use,
Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>sattler</strong>: Frank – this is Harvey Willows from the
L.A. Times. He’d like to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: It’s an incredible story going on here. Woman
accused of using sex to kill lover.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: I’ll say – it’s gonna give a whole new
meaning to the state nickname.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: What’s the state nickname?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: The Beaver State.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was
a good man – until she came along.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What changed?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: He did. Look, I know you can lead a horse to
water but you can’t make him drink – but you hold a pail of water in
front of an old horse for long enough – and well…</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You don’t really believe what the district
attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I don’t know. It’s incredible to think that
anyone could be capable of doing that – but if anyone could it would be
Rebecca.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I take it you don’t like Miss Lawson very
much?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I really don’t know her that well. We would
say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was
about it.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: If you don’t know her that well what makes
you think she’s capable of murder?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was
thirty years older than her. Where’s the attraction to sleep with
someone like that – to have the kind of sex they had.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: How do you know what kind of sex they
had?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I wasn’t lookin’ through the keyhole if
that’s what you’re thinking. I’d come to house sometimes to pick up
papers or speak to Andrew. I’d find their little toys all over the
place.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What about Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes – cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I was at the house one morning – I thought
Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh. When I went into the guest
bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white
powder out of a vial.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Is something wrong.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What? No – nothing. Thank you for your
time.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You lied to me!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I just left Joanne Braslow. She told me she
saw you doing cocaine at Marsh’s house!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: She’s mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: That’s not good enough, Goddamit!</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It isn’t true. You have to believe me.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: No, I don’t have to believe you. The jury
has to believe you and answers like he’s lying or she’s mistaken aren’t
going to convince them.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I don’t use cocaine anymore. If she says
she saw me doing it she’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Why would she lie?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I don’t know, Frank – but don’t you think
that’s something we should find out?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Michael – get off the phone.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Because I’m expecting a call.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: – But it’s Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I know what day it is! Get off the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: I gotta go. I’ll call you later.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca’s voice</strong>: This is Rebecca Lawson. I’m not in
right now. So if you please leave a message–</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I called you all weekend. Where were
you?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I went out on the boat.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Alone?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: This trial by its very nature is
explosive. The press is going to have a field day and I will not
tolerate any activity in my courtroom that will fuel it. Both of you are
going to be delving into very personal aspects of peoples lives. I warn
you now. When you do so – if you cannot establish a clear line of
relevancy early on in your examinations I will stop you. Is that
clear?</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Mr. Cardenas.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: You all can see the defendant, Rebecca
Lawson. But as this trial proceeds you will see that she is not only the
defendant – she is the murder weapon itself.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Mr. Dulaney?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I know what you’re thinking – and it’s a
mistake. You look at Miss Lawson and you see a beautiful woman who was
involved with an older man – and you think she looks like the type. She
could’ve done it. And that’s exactly what the District Attorney wants
you to think. Yes, she is beautiful. So what? Does that make her a
killer? Of course not. This case is not about appearances. It’s about
facts. As Mr. Cardenas presents his case you will see that there are
very few facts – that the bulk of the States evidence is circumstantial.
I’m confident that by the conclusion of this trial you will not just
have a reasonable doubt. You will have no doubt at all – that Rebecca
Lawson is innocent of the charges against her.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Doctor McCurdy, what was the cause of
death?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: A massive cardiac arrest.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What was Mr. Marsh’s physical condition
prior to his death?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: Very poor. He was suffering from severe
arterial disease.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Was the heart attack the result of natural
causes?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What induced it?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: We found a high concentration of cocaine in
his blood.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: So, Mr. Marsh used cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: I don’t think so. The membrane in his nasal
passage didn’t show any sign of long time usage.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Then how did it get into his body?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on
the nightstand. It was filled with water and cocaine. Mr. Marsh had a
head cold at the time of his death. I believe he wasn’t aware that he
was ingesting cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Is this the bottle that was found on the
nightstand?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Your Honor, the State enters this evidence
as exhibit A. Were any fingerprints found on the bottle?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: Yes – those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print
of Miss Lawson’s.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Dr. McCurdy, what would cocaine do to
someone in Mr. Marsh’s condition?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: Increase his heart rate.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: – And if he were in the midst of making
love while under the influence of cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: It would be an added stress to his
heart.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What would be the effect if someone
secretly administered cocaine to Mr. Marsh and then induced him to make
love?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: It would be the same as shooting a gun at
him.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Thank you, Doctor McCurdy. Your
witness.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Can you say with any certainty that
Mr. Marsh didn’t ingest the cocaine himself?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: No – but it seems highly unlikely that a
man in his condition would use cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: That’s your opinion, Doctor – but I’m
asking you if there is any scientific test that can tell who actually
put the cocaine into the Dristan bottle?</p>
<p><strong>mccurdy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Doctor Trammel, when did you first
diagnose that Mr. Marsh had heart disease?</p>
<p><strong>dr. trammel</strong>: About a year and half ago.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did Mr. Marsh change his lifestyle after
that?</p>
<p><strong>dr. trammel</strong>: Yes – he stopped smoking and drinking
and exercised regularly.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: He did everything he could to take care of
his heart?</p>
<p><strong>dr. trammel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh
to your office?</p>
<p><strong>dr. trammel</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Just one last question. What does the sign
on your office door say?</p>
<p><strong>dr. trammel</strong>: Doctor Steven Trammel.
Cardiologist.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss
Lawson about Mr. Marsh’s condition?</p>
<p><strong>dr. trammel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had
spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?</p>
<p><strong>dr. trammel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh
inside during his examinations?</p>
<p><strong>dr. trammel</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Then you have no way of knowing what
Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?</p>
<p><strong>dr. trammel</strong>: No. No, I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: How long were you Mr Marsh’s personal
secretary?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Six years.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
Cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: No – never.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What about Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Tell the court about that, please.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I opened the bathroom door one day and saw
Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did you see Mr. Marsh the day before his
death?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: How did he look?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Horrible. He was tired and pale.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did you talk about Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What did Mr. Marsh say?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: He was worried. He said that she was acting
stranger and stranger. He said that if this kept up she was going to
kill him. That his heart couldn’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Thank you. Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: How do you know it was cocaine that Miss
Lawson had in the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: What other kind of white powder do people
keep in a vial?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Do you remember the date when you saw Miss
Lawson in the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes– It was on a Friday. I remember because
I was going to visit my sister for her birthday. It would be October
twenty-eighth.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Could you repeat the last part of what
Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: He said that if it kept up she was going to
kill him. That his heart couldn’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Didn’t Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss
Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for
awhile?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes – he mentioned it.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: So, the woman he loved passionately was
thinking about leaving. That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless
nights. Incredible stress.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I suppose.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: So, isn’t it possible that he was confiding
in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last
chance for love? That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty
of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn’t stop it was going
to kill him. That if she did leave his heart couldn’t take it.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I don’t know. I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Well, think about it. Isn’t it
possible?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes. I suppose it’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You were brilliant today.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: It’s only the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Strong endings start with strong
beginnings. I love the way you twist what people say around –
manipulating their own words against them.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Can I see you later?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You can see me now.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I want you inside me.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Paley could be a problem tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’m sure you’ll be able to handle him.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m glad you have such confidence in
me.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Don’t worry about Paley. He can’t touch me.
No one can. I’ve thought it all out.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What does that mean? You’ve been thinking
about the case? Or you thought everything out before you killed
Marsh?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m sorry. Rebecca – I’m sorry. Really.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Sugar or honey?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Honey.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: The State calls Doctor Alan Paley.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Where did you meet Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: At a dinner party – about eight months
ago.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did you ever see her again after that?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: Yes – several times.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What eventually happened to your
relationship with Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: We stopped seeing each other.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: Well – I realized that she wasn’t
interested in me. She was just trying to get information out of me.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What kind of information?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: She said that she was working on a novel
and she wanted to know what kinds of drugs would be harmful to someone
with a bad heart.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did you suggest any?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: Yes – Insulin and others.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: She said that those weren’t any good –
because their use would be detected and the police would know the victim
had been poisoned. She wanted to know if there was a drug that would
induce a heart attack but could also be used to enhance a sexual
high.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: – And what did you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: Cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you
saw Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: We had dinner at a restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Isn’t it true that later that night you
tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You didn’t grab her and try to kiss
her?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: If necessary I can bring in the valet
parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: Well – as I remember it, we had an
argument.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: And the argument was about the fact that
you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: And after that didn’t you continuously
harass Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss
Lawson’s answering machine. I would like to play it now.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Objection. Your Honor, we don’t know where
this tape is from. Who made it – or under what circumstances it was
made.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: These are reports from two independent
audio labs. They each state that the voices were recorded over the phone
and that no alterations have been made.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: I’ll allow it.</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley’s voice</strong>: Rebecca – I know you’re there,
Godammit. Answer the phone, you bitch! You can’t treat me like this!</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley’s voice</strong>: You want to play games with me?
Who the fuck do you think you are? Okay - - we’ll play. You’ll be
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You’ll be sorry?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: I was angry.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You’re still angry, aren’t you? Isn’t it
true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on
your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: No – she asked me about cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I suggest it never happened.</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: You can suggest anything you want. It
happened.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: I may have been infatuated with her - -
but I wouldn’t perjure myself.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: That’s all Dr. Paley.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What the… What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Rebecca – take these off.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Tonight we open new doors.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What are you going you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Are you scared?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I love you, Frank. I love your strength –
be strong for me now.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Rebecca – please. No more.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I told you in the beginning that it was my
way. My way can be many things – pleasure or pain.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You see how life is, Frank? We judge
things. We look at things from the outside and assume we know what’s on
the inside.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Water. But you assumed it was vinegar –
because you were only looking at the outside.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Late night?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Yeah – what are you doing up?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: We have to talk.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: That’s what I was hoping you’d tell me.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Sharon, it’s late. Can we get to the
point?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Working. Charlie and I were going over some
statements.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for
you. You were with her, weren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why did you lie to me?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Because I knew you’d think exactly what
you’re thinking.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: This isn’t a courtroom. Don’t try to turn
this around on me.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You’re sleeping with her, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It’s bad enough that you are. It’s even
worse that you can stand here and lie to me.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Sharon…</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You bastard! Do you think I’m some kind of
idiot? That I don’t have fuckin’ eyes. I see. I feel. I hurt.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Mrs. Crawford, you were Mr. Marsh’s maid
for nine years?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did Miss Lawson and Mr. Marsh ever
argue?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Like cats and dogs.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What did they argue about?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: You name it – they argued about it. Mr. Marsh
tried his best to keep her happy – but it seemed that no matter what he
did it was never enough for her.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did they argue the day before he died?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Well – he died on a Sunday and I have the
weekends off – but they were ripping at each other with both barrels
Friday afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What was the nature of the argument?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: Sex.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Could you be more specific?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: She was calling Mr. Marsh an old man – making
discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities. She said that she
had needs and that if he couldn’t fulfill them she’d find someone who
could.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did you ever see Mr. Marsh use
cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: No – never.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: High school?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Your Honor, I fail to see what Mrs
Crawford’s educational background has to do with this case.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I was just about to make my point, Your
Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Do it quickly, Mr. Dulaney.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: “Discourteous insinuations about his sexual
abilities.” Who told you to say that?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Did Mr. Troxell help you with that
phrase?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: I heard him say it.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Then – those are not your own words?</p>
<p><strong>ester</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What else did the District Attorney’s
Office tell you to say?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Objection, Your Honor. The fact that
Mrs. Crawford heard Mr. Troxell reconstruct her sentence and decided to
rephrase her words in a more intelligent manner for the court doesn’t
mean the incident never happened.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m just curious to see if Mr. Troxell
reconstructed anything else.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Your Honor – please!</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: I’ll see both of you in my chambers.
Right now.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Mr. Dulaney, before you cast
aspersions on the District Attorney’s Office by suggesting they’ve
coaxed this witness to say things that aren’t true – you better have
more than a hunch. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: No, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Maybe you don’t know what it’s like
where Mrs. Crawford comes from – but I do. I came from a neighborhood
just like hers. This is a whole other world for her. She’s a poor
working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated
and mostly unsympathetic people. So, she puts on her best dress, fixes
her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.
Being poor and having pride is not a crime, Mr. Dulaney – and before you
attempt to impeach another witness’ testimony in my courtroom – your
foundations better be based on something other than semantics.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: I’m surprised you can walk after the way
Burnham chewed your ass out this afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’ve got work to do.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Hey – the bell’s sounded. It’s between
rounds.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I didn’t hear it.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What’s happening to you, Frank? You’re
acting like you’re on trial here. This has become personal to you.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Back off, John.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: You’re sleeping with her, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: That’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: I’m talking to you as a friend now. Don’t
ruin your life, your career for her. She’ll spit you out when this is
over.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You don’t know what you’re talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Really? What does an attorney speak to his
client about at her house until three o’clock in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You’ve been following me?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Her. It’s an obvious move. I’m building a
case against her, remember?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: If your head wasn’t up your ass you would
have thought of it too. You’re losing perspective. Get out while you can
– before she takes you down with her.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: I’ve been waiting for you to get back.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You got something on the coke?</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: No – but I got something.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: During lunch I was watching some of Marsh’s
home videos.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: He was really into recording this stuff. The
D.A.’s office found a box full of tapes.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: This girl has really got some moves, huh?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: If you want to get your kicks go to a video
store and rent a porno movie.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: This tape was recorded over an existing
recording.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Over what?</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: I would have missed it – but the phone rang
and I let it play while I talked. It looks like blank tape – but it
isn’t. It’s been erased without any input signal coming in.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: So, what good is it to us if it’s been
erased?</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: It’s very good – because when the D.A’s
office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they
would have buried it.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: Because it hasn’t all been erased.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Where’s the attraction to sleep with
someone like that.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I need to speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I don’t think we have anything more to talk
about, Mr. Dulaney.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You were sleeping with Marsh.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Who told you that?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: He video taped you.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: That bastard!</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I thought he was a kind, gentle man?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes, I slept with him but that was a long
time ago.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You’re lying. Marsh was wearing a cast on
the tape. It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson. He
dumped you for her, didn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: It must have been horrible. Having to go
there – seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the
same bed he did with you.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I was jealous. Of course I was hurt. He
switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with. But I
didn’t kill him.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I’m a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing
Andrew wasn’t in my best interest. As it is I’m out of a job and I’m not
in his will.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Money isn’t the only reason people commit
murder, Miss Braslow.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: The State calls Jeffery Roston.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Your Honor, I don’t see a Mr. Roston listed
as a prosecution witness.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: The State’s investigation just uncovered
Mr. Roston yesterday afternoon in Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Your Honor, Mr. Roston is an ex-lover of
Miss Lawson’s.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Why didn’t the State’s investigation
uncover Mr. Roston earlier?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: He was away on an extended vacation and
just returned two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Alright – I’m going to allow his
testimony.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: But Your Honor–</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: That’s it, Mr. Dulaney. Take a
seat.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Mr. Roston, what was your relationship
with Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: We were lovers.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: How long were you together?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: For about one year.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: How would you describe your sex life with
Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: Intense.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: I know this is a very personal subject,
but could you be a little more specific?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: It was wild. She was constantly trying to
get me more and more worked up – kinky things. I tried to satisfy her
the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What kind of condition are you referring
to?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: I had a bad heart.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What happened next?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: I had bypass surgery.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: And how are you now?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: Fine. The doctors say if I keep taking care
of myself I can live to be a very old man.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: How did your relationship with Miss Lawson
progress after the surgery?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: It didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: She left me.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Why did she say she was leaving?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: She didn’t. She just left.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Why do you think she left you?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: Well – I think that after the operation she
realized that…</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Objection. The question calls for a
conclusion on the part of the witness.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Your Honor, Mr. Roston lived with the
defendant for many months. I feel that his opinion is valid in
substantiating the character of the Miss Lawson.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an
objective view.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Objection sustained.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did Miss Lawson ever give you any
indication why she was leaving?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Objection. The witness has already stated
that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Mr. Cardenas, I suggest you move on
to another line of questioning.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: When you say your sexual relations with
Miss Lawson were intense what exactly do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: It was like she was trying to push me as far
as she could. She called it opening new doors.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Can you give the court an example?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: It was like sex was a game to her. She got
off on the control. She always used to tell me it had to be her way.</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: It’s hard to resist a woman as beautiful as
she is.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What would she do that made it hard to
resist?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: She’s a woman who is very much aware of her
own sexuality. Sometimes I felt she could read my mind. It was uncanny
how she knew exactly what I wanted. A few nights before my heart surgery
Rebecca woke me. She had handcuffed me to the bed.</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: She told me that tonight we were going to
open new doors. I asked her to stop – to take off the handcuffs, but she
wouldn’t listen.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Mr. Roston I know this is difficult for
you, but it’s important you tell the court what she did.</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: She said she was going to fuck me like I’ve
never been fucked before.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Due to the sensitive nature of this
witness’ testimony and the inability of the spectators to allow him to
complete it, I am clearing the courtroom.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What did she do next, Mr. Roston?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: She started touching herself and telling me
how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her. My
doctor had warned me about exerting myself – but you really don’t think
of those things at a moment like that. You just think about how
beautiful this woman is – how much you want her. How deeply you want to
please her. At first it started off slowly – but the rhythm built and
built. Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop. Eventually I
started to have trouble breathing. Rebecca just kept going – faster and
faster. No matter what I said she wouldn’t stop. I really thought for a
moment I was going to die.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: If you knew it was bad for you why did you
do it?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: I couldn’t help myself. You get lost inside
a women like her. It was like a drug. It was the best sex I ever
had.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: What happened after that?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: I woke up the next morning and she was
gone.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Did you change your will while you were
with Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Who was your primary beneficiary?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: She was.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Thank you. The State rests.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Mister Dulaney?</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Mister Dulaney?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Mr. Roston, you said it was the best sex
you ever had. Is that the best sex with a woman, or a man?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’ll rephrase the question. Mr. Roston
isn’t it true you are bisexual?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Objection! Mr. Roston’s sexual preferences
are not at issue in this trial.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Your Honor, I’m trying to establish the
sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived
with was a different person than she thought he was.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: The witness will answer the
question.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Mr. Roston?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: And your sexual tastes were something that
you hid from Miss Lawson?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: And didn’t Miss Lawson come home one day
and find you in bed with your male lover?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: And she left shortly after that?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: No. We worked things out. It was three weeks
later when I told her about the heart surgery that she left.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Would it be fair to say that when she did
find out it was a shock to her?</p>
<p><strong>roston</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What’s that for?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed
Roston today.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Rebecca – we shattered a man’s life in open
court.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Fuck him! He tried to shatter mine.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: He was only doing what he thought was
right.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You’re too weak, Frank. When you want
something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it. If something
gets in your way you remove it.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You killed him – didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I knew you were thinking that. I could see
it in your eyes today in the courtroom. You’re wrong, Frank. I need you
to believe that.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You don’t need anybody.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I do need you. No matter what you think of
me – I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m dropping the case.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No – you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: It gets easier, doesn’t it? Once you open
the door it never closes.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’ve got another copy. How do you think
your wife would feel if she saw this – not to mention your
colleagues?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You can think whatever you want, Frank –
but I didn’t kill Andrew, and I’m not going to prison for something I
didn’t do.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You’re a monster.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No – I’m a survivor.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: I’m sorry to barge in – but I figured after
that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good
news?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You got something on the Coke?</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: Do I? I talked to one of the dealers I put
the word out to. He’s been following the trial pretty closely. He said
at one time he wanted to be a lawyer before he became a dealer.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Charlie – are you going to make a point
soon?</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: Right now. Guess who’s been buying Coke from
him for the last five and half years?</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: Marsh’s secretary – Joanne Braslow.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Dr. Wong – what type of medicine do you
practice?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wong</strong>: Oriental medicine.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: –And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wong</strong>: Yes. I’ve been seeing her for over a
year.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Why does she come to you?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wong</strong>: She suffers from severe menstrual
cramps.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Did you ever prescribe any medication for
her cramps?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wong</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What did you prescribe for her?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wong</strong>: Chinese peony root.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Would you describe for the court what
Chinese peony root looks like?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wong</strong>: It’s a white powder that comes in a
vial.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: How do you instruct your patients to take
it?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wong</strong>: I tell them to pour an amount the size of
a quarter into the their hand and mix it with water.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: A previous witness stated that she saw Miss
Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth.
According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wong</strong>: October twenty-seventh.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: One last question, Doctor. If someone
didn’t know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for
cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>dr. wong</strong>: Yes – quite easy.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: No questions.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: You may call your next witness.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: The defense calls Miss Margaret
Sellers.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan
Paley?</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Where did you meet him?</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: I’m a nurse. I used to work at
Roseburg Memorial Hospital. Dr. Paley’s on staff there.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What was the nature of your relationship
with Dr. Paley.</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: We dated for about a month last
year.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: I realized he wasn’t serious. He was
seeing other women – asking other nurses at the hospital out, so I ended
it.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: – And what did Dr. Paley do after you
stopped seeing him?</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: He used to call me – tell me that I
couldn’t just walk out on him. He said that if I didn’t come back he’d
make my life miserable.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Did he make your life miserable?</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: Yes – he did.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Objection! May I remind Mr. Dulaney that
the person on trial here is Miss Lawson – not Dr. Paley.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Your Honor, I’m trying to establish a
pattern in Dr. Paley’s behavior with women.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Objection overruled. The witness will
answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: He’d call me in the middle of the
night. Show up at my house and bang on the door. Finally after two weeks
I went to his office one day to tell him to stop.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: He laughed – and basically said he
would decide when it was over.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Do you remember his exact words?</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: Yes. He said, “If you want to play
games, we’ll play – and you’ll be sorry.”</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What happened next?</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: While I was seeing Dr. Paley I
mentioned to him one night that someone was stealing drugs from the
third floor dispensary. Three days after I spoke to him in his office he
went to the Head Nurse and told her he had witnessed me stealing
drugs.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>miss sellers</strong>: There was an inquiry. It was his word
against mine. They believed him. I was fired.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: Joanne Braslow is getting more and more
interesting. I followed her today to an attorney’s office. Joseph
Koehler.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Joe Koehler. I know him. He’s an estate
attorney – and he’s very expensive.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate
attorney? She wasn’t even mentioned in Marsh’s will.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Not this will.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Here it is! According to the old will
Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: What good does that do – it’s the old
will?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Under the law a person cannot profit from
their own wrong doing. Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of
the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow
could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: She kills the old man and makes it look like
Miss Lawson did it. Pretty slick.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I was thinking that when the trial is over
we’d all go skiing for a weekend.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Maybe it would be a good idea if you just
took Michael.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Drug store.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Mr. Dulaney, are you ready to call
your next witness?</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Mr. Dulaney, are you with us?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Yes, Your Honor. The defense recalls Joanne
Braslow.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Miss Braslow, I’d like to remind you
that you are still under oath.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: How often do you use cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Objection, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Counsel approach the bench.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Mr. Dulaney, I’m getting tired of
seeing you this close to me.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Whether or not Miss Braslow uses drugs is
not an issue here.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Your Honor – the prosecution has introduced
cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may
have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Are you able to back up this
allegation – or are you fishing?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I can back it up.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: You better. Please answer the
question.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I’ve tried it.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You’ve tried it? Isn’t it true that you’ve
been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I’ve been to a few – yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You don’t like Miss Lawson much do you?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You don’t like her because you were
involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along. Isn’t that true?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You resented the fact that she told you
what to do in Mr. Marsh’s house?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: And you resented that he cared for her in a
way he once cared for you?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: –And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to
you?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: –and that he changed his will?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two
hundred and fifty thousand dollars – then he cut you out. Why do you
think he did that?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: She talked him into it. She wanted
everything.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a
lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You testified that you returned to
Mr. Marsh’s house at eleven o’clock the night of his murder. Is that
correct?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Well - I’m a little confused. This is a
charge receipt from Rosen’s Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account.
It’s dated the day of the murder. Is this your signature?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: There’s an item you picked up that’s
marked. Will you read it?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Dristan nasal spray.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Would you read for us the time of the
purchase?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Three fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: A.M – or P.M.?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You see that’s what bothers me. No other
bottle of nasal spray was found in the house. The police looked. There
was only the one bottle. But you say you didn’t arrive until after
Mr. Marsh was dead – yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to
his death. How do you think it got there?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Isn’t it true that you stopped by the house
after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Isn’t it true that you put the cocaine in
the bottle?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: No! Why would I want to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Because you were jealous. Because he cut
you out of the will. Because you have a cocaine habit to feed – because
you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void –
and there’s a very good chance the old one would be honored.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: The defense rests.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: We can’t go on like this, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Please – this is ripping us apart.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I can’t talk about it now.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Don’t shut me out. Let me in.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You wouldn’t like what you’d see. You don’t
know me anymore. I don’t know me anymore.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: We can’t pretend this isn’t happening.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Please – not now.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Why didn’t you come to me?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: You used to like to touch me – to make love
to me.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: It’s more involved than that.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: It was a place to start.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You think that’s the answer? Sex? Is that
what you want? You want me to make love to you?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: I don’t want our lives ruined because of
this. I love you, Frank. I want this to work – but you have to help me.
You have to come back from where ever it is you are.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Frank – stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Is this what you want – huh? Is it?</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Let me go! Godammit, Frank let go!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Daddy – stop it!</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Oh – Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>sharon</strong>: Frank?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m sorry. God – I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Help me. Please – help me.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Mr. Dulaney.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: The Prosecution’s case is built on theory –
speculation. Could Rebecca Lawson have done this? Is it possible that
she did that? Where are the facts? The evidence. The State has presented
two spurned lovers and a jealous secretary. Hardly what I would call
impartial witnesses. Where is one shred of conclusive, irrefutable
evidence? I don’t see it – and I don’t think you do either. Do you know
why? Because there isn’t any.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: It’s human nature. We want what we want –
when we want it. We don’t think about the consequences of our actions.
When desire fills us we all do things that we know are bad for us. We
live for the moment. Here was an exciting young woman who unlocked
doors. Doors that led into a new world. A world he entered willingly –
eagerly. He wanted to please her – and so, he did not tell her of his
illness. I know it might be difficult for you to understand wanting
something so badly that you are willing to risk everything – but that’s
what passion does to you. It’s a fire – uncontrollable. It consumes you
– and the only thing you can do is let it burn. Andrew Marsh let it
burn. It was his life - - his choice – and maybe his mistake – but
making love is not a crime. We all have fires inside us – secret
desires. We guard them –hold them in the cages that we’ve built. When
someone comes along and opens the gate, they rush out and feed blindly
on their pleasure. Rebecca Lawson loved Andrew Marsh. She didn’t kill
him – if anything did, it was his own passion.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: It’s true – we all have fires burning
inside us. Rebecca Lawson was very aware of the fire burning inside
Andrew Marsh – and she stoked those flames – fanning them until they
burned so hot that reason and judgement left him. Is making love a
crime? Of course not – but the question isn’t as simple as that. Rebecca
Lawson used her seductive qualities to entice Andrew Marsh. She used sex
as a catalyst and cocaine as the terminus. The combination of the two
provided the conclusion of a premeditated act. She asked Dr. Paley about
cocaine. Her fingerprints were found on the nasal spray bottle that
contained the cocaine – and she was the sole beneficiary of Andrew
Marsh’s will. She planned it from beginning to end. She knew about his
heart. She secretly administered cocaine, then used wild and physically
demanding sex to induce a heart attack. Making love is an act of passion
between two people to affirm their vows of love. This was not an act of
love – this was an act of greed. This was betrayal. Rebecca Lawson
killed Andrew Marsh – and I’m counting on you to punish her for that
crime.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: They’re back already? It’s only been three
hours.</p>
<p><strong>judge burnham</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,
have you reached a verdict?</p>
<p><strong>jury foreman</strong>: We have, Your Honor.</p>
<p><strong>court clerk</strong>: The jury finds the defendant – not
guilty.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: What are you gonna do now?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Take some time off.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: You think the D.A.’s gonna file on
Joanne?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You did a good job, Charlie.</p>
<p><strong>biggs</strong>: Thanks, Mister D.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: That bastard should have left me something.
I worked for him for six years – and he goes and gives it all to
her.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: You take what people say and make it ugly.
You make others believe what you want them to. She should have been
found guilty. She shouldn’t have gotten off.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Then you would have gotten your money?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You killed him – didn’t you, Joanne?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Do you think if I did I’d be stupid enough
to tell you?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: What do you have in your purse?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: What do you think I’ve got? A gun? Maybe I’m
gonna kill you too. Maybe I’ll blow your head off right now.</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: I’m gonna go to jail. I know they’re gonna
make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Why’d you come here?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: To show you this. It’s a letter from that
lawyer, Koehler. He wrote it to me the day after I saw him. He’s the one
who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You didn’t know about it before that?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the
first place?</p>
<p><strong>joanne</strong>: Because he called me.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Hi, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>koehler</strong>: Frank – what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I need to ask you a question. What made you
get in touch with Joanne Braslow?</p>
<p><strong>koehler</strong>: You know I can’t talk about that.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m not asking for names or specifics. I
just want to know what prompted you to make the call?</p>
<p><strong>koehler</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Please – I need your help.</p>
<p><strong>koehler</strong>: All I can tell you is I was contacted by an
interested party on Miss Braslow’s behalf.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Frank – It’s Rebecca. I need to see you
right away. I’ve got the tape.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Rebecca?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Is this what you’re looking for, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You killed him. You killed him – and I got
you off.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: That’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Is it? Joanne Braslow was perfect, wasn’t
she? You knew we’d see her on the tape and find out about her coke
problem. After that, the digging should have been easy – but we missed
the will. You knew we were following her, so you called Koehler and had
him contact her. That put us right back on track. All we needed then was
to prove that she had an opportunity. The drug store took care of that.
She dropped off the stuff and you came back and killed him. Didn’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I want the tape.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I’ve been thinking about that. I’ve decided
to give it to you after I’ve collected the inheritance. You can take
that one if you want – but there’s another copy.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: That wasn’t the deal.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: So, sue me. Things have changed. I think
you should go home – and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever
have contact again.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m not leaving without that tape.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Don’t push me, Frank. I might lose my
temper and send it out just for spite.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: You fuckin’ bitch!</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Let her go!</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: Are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: You’ve got to kill him, Alan.</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: She’s right, Paley. You’ve got to kill me.
She doesn’t have to – she’s free – she can’t be tried again – but you,
you planned it with her. You supplied the Coke. You’re an accessory to
murder.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Shoot him.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Don’t you see what she’s doing? She needs
you to kill me. She’s planned it that way from the start. That’s why she
phoned me tonight.</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: You called him?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: No – he’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: How’s it supposed to work Rebecca? You and
Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight
so he has to rush in and save you – but then he’s given himself away as
your accomplice – now he has to kill me. After that I figure she’ll tell
the Police that you broke in. That you were crazed because we humiliated
you in court?</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Don’t listen to him. Can’t you see he’s
trying to turn you against me.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Here’s the good part. The truth dies with
me and she turns State’s evidence against you. It won’t matter what you
say. No one will believe your version – you’ve already discredited
yourself in court. You’ll go away forever and she’ll have the money all
for herself. She’s played us both perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Alan, listen to me. If you don’t kill him
it’s over. Everything we did will be for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: Shut up, Rebecca.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: She’s good isn’t she? But maybe with you
it’s the real thing. I’m sure all those nights she was fuckin’ me she
was thinking of you.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I’m sure that every orgasm she had with me
was faked.</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: That’s enough.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: I mean she only screwed me two or three
times a night because she had to – I’m sure she didn’t enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: I love you, Alan. You have to believe I
love you. Kill him! Kill him and we can be together forever!</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: That’s right, she loves you. Just like she
loved Roston and Marsh and me. Don’t be a fool. You’re nothing to her.
The second you pull that trigger she’ll turn on you.</p>
<p><strong>dr. paley</strong>: I loved you.</p>
<p><strong>rebecca</strong>: Alan, don’t let him do this. You’re
everything to me. Give me the gun. Give me the gun and I’ll do it for
you.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Paley’s confessed to the whole thing. It’s
like he’s got no will to live now that she’s gone. She almost got away
with it. Ironic, huh? Do you believe in karma, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Well – call it what you want. Fate.
Destiny. We usually get what we deserve in the end.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Can I go?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: You get his statement?</p>
<p><strong>troxell</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Then you can go.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: Frank?</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: I found this video in her room. It has
your name on it.</p>
<p><strong>cardenas</strong>: I assume it’s yours.</p>
<p><strong>dulaney</strong>: Thanks.</p>
