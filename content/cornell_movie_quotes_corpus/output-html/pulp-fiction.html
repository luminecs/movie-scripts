<p><strong>young man</strong>: No, forget it, it’s too risky. I’m
through doin’ that shit.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: You always say that, the same thing
every time: never again, I’m through, too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I know that’s what I always say. I’m
always right too, but �</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: � but you forget about it in a day or
two -</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: � yeah, well, the days of me forgittin’
are over, and the days of me rememberin’ have just begun.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: When you go on like this, you know what
you sound like?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I sound like a sensible fucking man, is
what I sound like.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: You sound like a duck. Quack, quack,
quack, quack, quack, quack, quack…</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Well take heart, ’cause you’re never
gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I’m never gonna do it again,
you’re never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I’m never gonna do it
again.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: After tonight.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Correct. I got all tonight to quack.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Can I get anybody anymore coffee?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Oh yes, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I’m doin’ fine.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I mean the way it is now, you’re takin’
the same fuckin’ risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk.
Banks are easier! Federal banks aren’t supposed to stop you anyway,
during a robbery. They’re insured, why should they care? You don’t even
need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a
federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the
guy on the other end of the phone said: “We got this guy’s little girl,
and if you don’t give him all your money, we’re gonna kill ’er.”</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Did it work?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Fuckin’ A it worked, that’s what I’m
talkin’ about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a
pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin’ phone, cleans the place out, and
they don’t lift a fuckin’ finger.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Did they hurt the little girl?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I don’t know. There probably never was a
little girl � the point of the story isn’t the little girl. The point of
the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: You wanna rob banks?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I’m not sayin’ I wanna rob banks, I’m
just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been
doin’.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: So you don’t want to be a bank
robber?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Naw, all those guys are goin’ down the
same road, either dead or servin’ twenty.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: And no more liquor stores?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: What have we been talking about? Yeah, no
more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain’t the giggle it usta be. Too many
foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can’t fuckin’
speak English. You tell ‘em: “Empty out the register,” and they don’t
know what it fuckin’ means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one
of those gook motherfuckers’ gonna make us kill ’em.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: I’m not gonna kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I don’t wanna kill anybody either. But
they’ll probably put us in a situation where it’s us of them. And if
it’s not the gooks, it these old Jews who’ve owned the store for fifteen
fuckin’ generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin’ behind the counter
with a fuckin’ Magnum. Try walkin’ into one of those stores with nothin’
but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we’re out
of it.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Well, what else is there, day jobs?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Not this life.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Well what then?</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Garcon! Coffee!</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: This place.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: “Garcon” means boy.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Here? It’s a coffee shop.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: What’s wrong with that? People never rob
restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your
head blown off stickin’ up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down. They’re not expecting to get robbed, or
not as expecting.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: I bet in places like this you could cut
down on the hero factor.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Correct. Just like banks, these places
are insured. The managers don’t give a fuck, they’re just tryin’ to get
ya out the door before you start pluggin’ diners. Waitresses, forget it,
they ain’t takin’ a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetback
gettin’ paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you’re
stealin’ from the owner. Customers are sittin’ there with food in their
mouths, they don’t know what’s goin’ on. One minute they’re havin’ a
Denver omelet, next minute somebody’s stickin’ a gun in their face.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: See, I got the idea last liquor store we
stuck up. ‘Member all those customers kept comin’ in?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Then you got the idea to take everybody’s
wallet.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: That was a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: We made more from the wallets then we did
the register.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Yes we did.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: A lot of people go to restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: A lot of wallets.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Pretty smart, huh?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Pretty smart. I’m ready, let’s go,
right here, right now.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Remember, same as before, you’re crowd
control, I handle the employees.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: I love you, Pumpkin.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: I love you, Honey Bunny.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Everybody be cool this is a robbery!</p>
<p><strong>honey bunny</strong>: Any of you fuckin’ pricks move and I’ll
execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: � Okay now, tell me about the hash bars?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What so you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well, hash is legal there, right?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah, it’s legal, but is ain’t a hundred
percent legal. I mean you can’t walk into a restaurant, roll a joint,
and start puffin’ away. You’re only supposed to smoke in your home or
certain designated places.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Those are hash bars?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah, it breaks down like this: it’s legal
to buy it, it’s legal to own it and, if you’re the proprietor of a hash
bar, it’s legal to sell it. It’s legal to carry it, which doesn’t really
matter ’cause � get a load of this � if the cops stop you, it’s illegal
for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in
Amsterdam don’t have.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That did it, man � I’m fuckin’ goin’, that’s
all there is to it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You’ll dig it the most. But you know what
the funniest thing about Europe is?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s the little differences. A lotta the
same shit we got here, they got there, but there they’re a little
different.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Examples?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well, in Amsterdam, you can buy beer in a
movie theatre. And I don’t mean in a paper cup either. They give you a
glass of beer, like in a bar. In Paris, you can buy beer at MacDonald’s.
Also, you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in
Paris?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: They don’t call it a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No, they got the metric system there, they
wouldn’t know what the fuck a Quarter Pounder is.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What’d they call it?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Royale with Cheese.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Royale with Cheese. What’d they call a Big
Mac?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Big Mac’s a Big Mac, but they call it Le
Big Mac.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I dunno, I didn’t go into a Burger King.
But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of
ketchup?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Mayonnaise.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Goddamn!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I seen ‘em do it. And I don’t mean a little
bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin’ drown ’em in it.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Uuccch!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We should have shotguns for this kind of
deal.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How many up there?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Three or four.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Counting our guy?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So there could be five guys up there?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: It’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: We should have fuckin’ shotguns.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Mia.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How did Marsellus and her meet?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I dunno, however people meet people. She usta
be an actress.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: She ever do anything I woulda saw?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I think her biggest deal was she starred in a
pilot.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What’s a pilot?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well, you know the shows on TV?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I don’t watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Yes, but you’re aware that there’s an
invention called television, and on that invention they show shows?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is
they make one show, and that show’s called a pilot. And they show that
one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that
one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted
and become TV programs, and some don’t, and become nothing. She starred
in one of the ones that became nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half- black,
half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah maybe, fat right?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I wouldn’t go so far as to call the brother
fat. He’s got a weight problem. What’s the nigger gonna do, he’s
Samoan.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I think I know who you mean, what about
him?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good. And
word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace’s
wife.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What’d he do, fuck her?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: No no no no no no no, nothin’ that bad.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well what then?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: He gave her a foot massage.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: A foot massage?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s all?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What did Marsellus do?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Sent a couple of guys over to his place. They
took him out on the patio of his apartment, threw his ass over the
balcony. Nigger fell four stories. They had this garden at the bottom,
enclosed in glass, like one of them greenhouses � nigger fell through
that. Since then, he’s kinda developed a speech impediment.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s a damn shame.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Still I hafta say, play with matches, ya
get burned.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Whaddya mean?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You don’t be givin’ Marsellus Wallace’s new
bride a foot massage.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You don’t think he overreacted?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Antwan probably didn’t expect Marsellus to
react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: It was a foot massage, a foot massage is
nothing, I give my mother a foot massage.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s laying hands on Marsellus Wallace’s
new wife in a familiar way. Is it as bad as eatin’ her out � no, but
you’re in the same fuckin’ ballpark.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Whoa… whoa… whoa… stop right there. Eatin’ a
bitch out, and givin’ a bitch a foot massage ain’t even the same fuckin’
thing.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Not the same thing, the same ballpark.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: It ain’t no ballpark either. Look maybe your
method of massage differs from mine, but touchin’ his lady’s feet, and
stickin’ your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain’t the same
ballpark, ain’t the same league, ain’t even the same fuckin’ sport. Foot
massages don’t mean shit.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Have you ever given a foot massage?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Don’t be tellin’ me about foot massages � I’m
the foot fuckin’ master.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Given a lot of ’em?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Shit yeah. I got my technique down man, I
don’t tickle or nothin’.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Have you ever given a guy a foot
massage?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How many?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Would you give me a foot massage � I’m
kinda tired.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Man, you best back off, I’m gittin’ pissed �
this is the door.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Seven-twenty-two in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: It ain’t quite time, let’s hang back.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Look, just because I wouldn’t give no man a
foot massage, don’t make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a
building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin’ up the way the nigger
talks. That ain’t right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better
paralyze my ass, ’cause I’d kill’a motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m not sayin’ he was right, but you’re
sayin’ a foot massage don’t mean nothing, and I’m sayin’ it does. I’ve
given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant
somethin’. We act like they don’t, but they do. That’s what’s so fuckin’
cool about ‘em. This sensual thing’s goin’ on that nobody’s talkin
about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin’ Marsellus knew it, and
Antwan shoulda known fuckin’ better. That’s his fuckin’ wife, man. He
ain’t gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That’s an interesting point, but let’s get
into character.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What’s her name again?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Mia. Why you so interested in big man’s
wife?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well, Marsellus is leavin’ for Florida and
when he’s gone, he wants me to take care of Mia.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Take care of her?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Not that! Take her out. Show her a good
time. Don’t let her get lonely.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You’re gonna be takin’ Mia Wallace out on a
date?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It ain’t a date. It’s like when you and
your buddy’s wife go to a movie or somethin’. It’s just… you know… good
company.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s not a date.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Hey kids.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: How you boys doin’?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Am I trippin’, or did I just ask you a
question.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: We’re doin’ okay.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Do you know who we are?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We’re associates of your business partner
Marsellus Wallace, you remember your business partner dont’ya?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Now I’m gonna take a wild guess here: you’re
Brett, right?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I’m Brett.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I thought so. Well, you remember your
business partner Marsellus Wallace, dont’ya Brett?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I remember him.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Good for you. Looks like me and Vincent
caught you at breakfast, sorry ‘bout that. What’cha eatin’?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Hamburgers.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Hamburgers. The cornerstone of any nutritious
breakfast. What kinda hamburgers?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Cheeseburgers.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: No, I mean where did you get’em? MacDonald’s,
Wendy’s, Jack-in-the- Box, where?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Big Kahuna Burger.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Big Kahuna Burger. That’s that Hawaiian
burger joint. I heard they got some tasty burgers. I ain’t never had one
myself, how are they?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: They’re good.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Mind if I try one of yours?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Yours is this one, right?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Uuummmm, that’s a tasty burger. Vince, you
ever try a Big Kahuna Burger?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You wanna bite, they’re real good.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I ain’t hungry.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well, if you like hamburgers give ’em a try
sometime. Me, I can’t usually eat ’em ’cause my girlfriend’s a
vegetarian. Which more or less makes me a vegetarian, but I sure love
the taste of a good burger. You know what they call a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese in France?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Tell ’em, Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Royale with Cheese.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Royale with Cheese, you know why they call it
that?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Because of the metric system?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Check out the big brain on Brett. You’a smart
motherfucker, that’s right. The metric system. What’s in this?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Sprite.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Sprite, good, mind if I have some of your
tasty beverage to wash this down with?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Uuuuummmm, hit’s the spot! You, Flock of
Seagulls, you know what we’re here for?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Then why don’t you tell my boy here Vince,
where you got the shit hid.</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: It’s under the be �</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: � I don’t remember askin’ you a goddamn
thing. You were sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>roger</strong>: It’s under the bed.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We happy?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Vincent!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We happy?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: We’re happy.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Look, what’s your name? I got his name’s
Vincent, but what’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: My name’s Pitt, and you ain’t talkin’ your
ass outta this shit.</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I just want you to know how sorry we are
about how fucked up things got between us and Mr. Wallace. When we
entered into this thing, we only had the best intentions �</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Oh, I’m sorry. Did that break your
concentration? I didn’t mean to do that. Please, continue. I believe you
were saying something about “best intentions.”</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Whatsamatter? Oh, you were through anyway.
Well, let me retort. Would you describe for me what Marsellus Wallace
looks like?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What country you from!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: “What” ain’t no country I know! Do they speak
English in “What?”</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: English-motherfucker-can-you-speak- it?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Then you understand what I’m sayin’?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Now describe what Marsellus Wallace looks
like!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Say “What” again! C’mon, say “What” again! I
dare ya, I double dare ya motherfucker, say “What” one more goddamn
time!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Now describe to me what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Well he’s… he’s… black �</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: � go on!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: …and he’s… he’s… bald �</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: � does he look like a bitch?!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Then why did you try to fuck ’im like a
bitch?!</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck ’im. You
ever read the Bible, Brett?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: There’s a passage I got memorized, seems
appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. “The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and
good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is
truly his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will
strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who
attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is
the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.”</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: I think you’re gonna find � when all this
shit is over and done � I think you’re gonna find yourself one smilin’
motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right now you got ability. But painful as
it may be, ability don’t last. Now that’s a hard motherfuckin’ fact of
life, but it’s a fact of life your ass is gonna hafta git realistic
about. This business is filled to the brim with unrealistic
motherfuckers who thought their ass aged like wine. Besides, even if you
went all the way, what would you be? Feather-weight champion of the
world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you can even get a credit card based on
that.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Now the night of the fight, you may fell
a slight sting, that’s pride fuckin’ wit ya. Fuck pride! Pride only
hurts, it never helps. Fight through that shit. ‘Cause a year from now,
when you’re kickin’ it in the Caribbean you’re gonna say, “Marsellus
Wallace was right.”</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I got no problem with that.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: In the fifth, your ass goes down.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Say it!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: In the fifth, my ass goes down.</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam,
git your ass on in here.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Where’s the big man?</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: He’s over there, finishing up some
business.</p>
<p><strong>vincent’s pov</strong>: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure
with his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of yet still
UNSEEN Marsellus.</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: Hang back for a second or two, and
when you see the white boy leave, go on over. In the meanwhile, can I
make you an espresso?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How ‘bout a cup of just plain lo’
American?</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: Comin’ up. I hear you’re taking Mia
out tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: At Marsellus’ request.</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: Have you met Mia?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: Not a goddamn thing.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Look, I’m not a idiot. She’s the big man’s
fuckin’ wife. I’m gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth
closed, laugh at her jokes and that’s all I’m gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: My name’s Paul, and this is between
y’all.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Can I get a pack’a Red Apples?</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: Filters?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Non.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Lookin’ at somethin’, friend?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I ain’t your friend, palooka.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I think ya heard me just fine, punchy.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Vincent Vega has entered the building,
git your ass over here!</p>
<p><strong>butch’s pov</strong>: Vincent hugging and kissing the
obscured figure that is Marsellus.</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: Pack of Red Apples, dollar-forty.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: …I’ll lend it to you. It’s a great book on
body piercing.</p>
<p><strong>trudi</strong>: You know how they use that gun when they
pierce your ears? They don’t use that when they pierce your nipples, do
they?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Forget that gun. That gun goes against the
entire idea behind piercing. All of my piercing, sixteen places on my
body, every one of ’em done with a needle. Five in each ear. One through
the nipple on my left breast. One through my right nostril. One through
my left eyebrow. One through my lip. One in my clit. And I wear a stud
in my tongue.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Excuse me, sorry to interrupt. I’m curious,
why would you get a stud in your tongue?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: It’s a sex thing. It helps fellatio.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Vince, you can come in now!</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Now this is Panda, from Mexico. Very good
stuff. This is Bava, different, but equally good. And this is Choco from
the Hartz Mountains of Germany. Now the first two are the same, forty-
five an ounce � those are friend prices � but this one… …this one’s a
little more expensive. It’s fifty-five. But when you shoot it, you’ll
know where that extra money went. Nothing wrong with the first two. It’s
real, real, real, good shit. But this one’s a fuckin’ madman.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Remember, I just got back from
Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Am I a nigger? Are you in Inglewood?
No. You’re in my house. White people who know the difference between
good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to. My shit, I’ll
take the Pepsi Challenge with Amsterdam shit any ol’ day of the fuckin’
week.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s a bold statement.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: This ain’t Amsterdam, Vince. This is a
seller’s market. Coke is fuckin’ dead as disco. Heroin’s comin’ back in
a big fuckin’ way. It’s this whole seventies retro. Bell bottoms,
heroin, they’re as hot as hell.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Give me three hundred worth of the madman.
If it’s as good as you say, I’ll be back for a thousand.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I just hope I still have it. Whaddya think of
Trudi? She ain’t got a boyfriend, wanna hand out an’ get high?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Which one’s Trudi? The one with all the
shit in her face?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: No, that’s Jody. That’s my wife.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m on my way somewhere. I got a dinner
engagement. Rain check?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: No problem?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You don’t mind if I shoot up here?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Me casa, su casa.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Mucho gracias.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Still got your Malibu?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You know what some fucker did to it the
other day?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Fuckin’ keyed it.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Oh man, that’s fucked up.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing
in storage three years. It’s out five fuckin’ days � five days, and some
dickless piece of shit fucks with it.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: They should be fuckin’ killed. No trial, no
jury, straight to execution.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I just wish I caught ‘em doin’ it, ya know?
Oh man, I’d give anything to catch ‘em doin’ it. It’a been worth his
doin’ it, if I coulda just caught ’em, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: It’s chicken shit. You don’t fuck another
man’s vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Hi, Vincent. I’m getting dressed. The door’s
open. Come inside and make yourself a drink.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Vincent. I’m on the intercom.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: It’s on the wall by the two African fellas.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: To your right.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: …warm. Warmer. Disco.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Push the button if you want to talk.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Go make yourself a drink., and I’ll be down in
two shakes of a lamb’s tail.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: The bar’s by the fireplace.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What the fuck is this place?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: This is Jackrabbit Slim’s. An Elvis man should
love it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Come on, Mia, let’s go get a steak.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You can get a steak here, daddy-o. Don’t be
a…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: After you, kitty-cat.</p>
<p>****: . The booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up
bodies of 50s cars.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Hi, I’m Buddy, what can I get’cha?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ll have the Douglas Sirk steak.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: How d’ya want it, burnt to a crisp, or bloody
as hell?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Bloody as hell. And to drink, a vanilla
coke.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: How ’bout you, Peggy Sue?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I’ll have the Durwood Kirby burger � bloody �
and a five-dollar shake.</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: How d’ya want that shake, Martin and Lewis,
or Amos and Andy?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Martin and Lewis.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Did you just order a five-dollar shake?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Sure did.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: A shake? Milk and ice cream?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It costs five dollars?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You don’t put bourbon in it or
anything?</p>
<p><strong>buddy</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Just checking.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Whaddya think?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s like a wax museum with a pulse
rate.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Rollin’ a smoke.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: It’s just tobacco.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Oh. Well in that case, will you roll me one,
cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You can have this one, cowgirl.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Think nothing of it.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Marsellus said you just got back from
Amsterdam.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Sure did. I heard you did a pilot.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: That was my fifteen minutes.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: It was show about a team of female secret
agents called “Fox Force Five.”</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: “Fox Force Five.” Fox, as in we’re a bunch of
foxy chicks. Force, as in we’re a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in
there’s one… two … three… four… five of us. There was a blonde one,
Sommerset O’Neal from that show “Baton Rouge,” she was the leader. A
Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me. We all
had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese
fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the
French fox’ specialty was sex…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What was your specialty?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy,
her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up
doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in
the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was
also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze
artist � when you’re keeping the world safe from evil, you never know
when being a trapeze artist’s gonna come in handy. And she knew a
zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If
we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every
episode I woulda told and ol joke.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Do you remember any of the jokes?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Well I only got the chance to say one, ’cause
we only did one show.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: No. It’s really corny.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: C’mon, don’t be that way.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: No. You won’t like it and I’ll be
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You told it in front of fifty million
people and you can’t tell it to me? I promise I won’t laugh.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: That’s what I’m afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s not what I meant and you know
it.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You’re quite the silver tongue devil, aren’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I meant I wouldn’t laugh at you.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: That’s not what you said Vince. Well now I’m
definitely not gonna tell ya, ’cause it’s been built up too much.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What a gyp.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Yummy!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Can I have a sip of that? I’d like to know
what a five-dollar shake tastes like.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You can use my straw, I don’t have kooties.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah, but maybe I do.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Kooties I can handle.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Goddamn! That’s a pretty fuckin’ good milk
shake.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Told ya.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I don’t know if it’s worth five dollars,
but it’s pretty fuckin’ good.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Don’t you hate that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Uncomfortable silences. Why do we feel it’s
necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: That’s when you know you found somebody
special. When you can just shit the fuck up for a minute, and
comfortably share silence.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I don’t think we’re there yet. But don’t
feel bad, we just met each other.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Well I’ll tell you what, I’ll go to the
bathroom and powder my nose, while you sit here and think of something
to say.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ll do that.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I said goddamn!</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Don’t you love it when you go to the bathroom
and you come back to find your food waiting for you?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: We’re lucky we got it at all. Buddy Holly
doesn’t seem to be much of a waiter. We shoulda sat in Marilyn Monroe’s
section.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Which one, there’s two Marilyn Monroes.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No there’s not.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s Marilyn Monroe…</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: … and that’s Mamie Van Doren. I don’t see
Jayne Mansfield, so it must be her night off.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Pretty smart.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I have moments.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Did ya think of something to say?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Actually, there’s something I’ve wanted to
ask you about, but you seem like a nice person, and I didn’t want to
offend you.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Oooohhhh, this doesn’t sound like mindless,
boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually
have something to say.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Only if you promise not to get
offended.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You can’t promise something like that. I have
no idea what you’re gonna ask. You could ask me what you’re gonna ask
me, and my natural response could be to be offended. Then, through no
fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Then let’s just forget it.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: That is an impossibility. Trying to forget
anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Is that a fact?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Besides, it’s more exciting when you don’t have
permission.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What do you think about what happened to
Antwan?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Who’s Antwan?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Tony Rocky Horror.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: He fell out of a window.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: That’s one way to say it. Another way is,
he was thrown out. Another was is, he was thrown out by Marsellus. And
even another way is, he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because
of you.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Is that a fact?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No it’s not, it’s just what I heard.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Who told you this?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: They.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: They talk a lot, don’t they?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: They certainly do.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Well don’t by shy Vincent, what exactly did
they say?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the
F-word?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a
foot massage.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: And…?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No and, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a
four-story window because he massaged my feet?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: And you believed that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: At the time I was told, it seemed
reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story
window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn’t
mean it didn’t happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: A husband being protective of his wife is one
thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife’s feet
is something else.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: But did it happen?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was
my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once � at my wedding � then never
again. The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror
out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you
scamps get together, you’re worse than a sewing circle.</p>
<p><strong>ed sullivan</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment
you’ve all been waiting for, the worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim’s twist
contest.</p>
<p><strong>ed sullivan</strong>: …One lucky couple will win this
handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding.</p>
<p><strong>ed sullivan</strong>: …Now, who will be our first
contestants?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I wanna dance.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No, no, no no, no, no, no, no.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do believe
Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do
whatever I wanted, Now, I want to dance. I want to win. I want that
trophy.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: So, dance good.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: All right, you asked for it.</p>
<p><strong>ed sullivan</strong>: Let’s hear it for our first
contestants.</p>

<p><strong>ed sullivan</strong>: And, uh, how ’bout your fella here?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Vincent Vega.</p>
<p><strong>ed sullivan</strong>: All right, let’s see what you can do.
Take it away!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Was than an uncomfortable silence?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: I don’t know what that was. Music and
drinks!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m gonna take a piss.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: That was a little bit more information than I
needed to know, but go right ahead.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Disco! Vince, you little cola nut, you’ve been
holding out on me.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: One drink and leave. Don’t be rude, but
drink your drink quickly, say goodbye, walk out the door, get in your
car, and go down the road.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …It’s a moral test of yourself, whether or
not you can maintain loyalty. Because when people are loyal to each
other, that’s very meaningful.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So you’re gonna go out there, drink your
drink, say “Goodnight, I’ve had a very lovely evening,” go home, and
jack off. And that’s all you’re gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Mia! MIA! What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ll be a son-of-a-bitch. Mia! MIA! What
did you take? Answer me honey, what did you take?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Okay honey, we’re getting you on your
feet.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: We’re on our feet now, and now we’re gonna
talk out to the car. Here we go, watch us walk.</p>

Doing on me.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Don’t bring her here! I’m not even fuckin’

<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No choice.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: She’s ODin’?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah. She’s dyin’.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Then bite the fuckin’ bullet, take ’er to a
hospital and call a lawyer!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Negative.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: She ain’t my fuckin’ problem, you fucked her
up, you deal with it � are you talkin’ to me on a cellular phone?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I don’t know you, who is this, don’t come

turns me into a bar soap, I’m gonna be forced to tell ’im about how you
coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front
lawn.</p>

<p><strong>lance</strong>: Look, just keep talkin’ to her, okay? While
she’s gettin’ the shot, I gotta get a medical book.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What do you need a medical book for?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: To tell me how to do it. I’ve never given an
adrenaline shot before.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You’ve had that thing for six years and you
never used it?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I never had to use it. I don’t go joypoppin’
with bubble-gummers, all of my friends can handle their highs!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well then get it.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I am, if you’ll let me.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m not fuckin’ stoppin’ you.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Stop talkin’ to me, and start talkin’ to
her.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Hurry up man! We’re losin’ her!</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I’m looking as fast as I can!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What’s he lookin’ for?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I dunno, some medical book.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What are you lookin’ for?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: My black medical book!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Whata’re you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: My black fuckin’ medical book. It’s like a
text book they give to nurses.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: I never saw a medical book.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Trust me, I have one.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Well if it’s that important, why didn’t you
keep it with the shot?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I don’t know! Stop bothering me!</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: While you’re lookin’ for it, that girl’s gonna
die on our carpet. You’re never gonna find it in all this shit. For six
months now, I’ve been telling you to clean this room �</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: � get your ass in here, fuck the book!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Quit fuckin’ around man and give her the
shot!</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: While I’m doing this, take her shirt off and
find her heart.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Does it have to be exact?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah, it has to be exact! I’m giving her an
injection in the heart, so I gotta exactly hit her in the heart.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well, I don’t know exactly where her heart
is, I think it’s here.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I need a big fat magic marker, got one?</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I need a big fat magic marker, any felt
pen’ll do, but a magic marker would be great.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: It’s ready, I’ll tell you what to do.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You’re gonna give her the shot.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: No, you’re gonna give her the shot.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ve never does this before.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I’ve never done this before either, and I
ain’t starting now. You brought ’er here, that means you give her the
shot. The day I bring an ODing bitch to your place, then I gotta give
her the shot.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Okay, what do I do?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Well, you’re giving her an injection of
adrenaline straight to her heart. But she’s got a breast plate in front
of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is
bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I gotta stab her?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: If you want the needle to pierce through to
her heart, you gotta stab her hard.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What happens after that?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: I’m curious about that myself.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: This ain’t a fuckin’ joke man!</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: She’s supposed to come out of it like � �
that.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Count to three.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: One…</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: …two…</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: …three!</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: If you’re okay, say something.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Something.</p>
<p><strong>jody</strong>: Anybody want a beer?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Mia!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What are your thoughts on how to handle
this?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: What’s yours?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well I’m of the opinion that Marsellus can
live his whole live and never ever hear of this incident.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Don’t worry about it. If Marsellus ever heard
of this, I’d be in as much trouble as you.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I seriously doubt that.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: If you can keep a secret, so can I.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Let’s shake on it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Mum’s the word.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: If you’ll excuse me, I gotta go home and
have a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: You still wanna hear my “FOX FORCE FIVE”
joke?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Sure, but I think I’m still a little too
petrified to laugh.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Uh-huh. You won’t laugh because it’s not funny.
But if you still wanna hear it, I’ll tell it.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I can’t wait.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Three tomatoes are walking down the street, a
poppa tomato, a momma tomato, and a little baby tomato. The baby tomato
is lagging behind the poppa and momma tomato. The poppa tomato gets mad,
goes over to the momma tomato and stamps on him � � and says: catch
up.</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: See ya ’round, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Butch.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Butch, stop watching TV a second. We got a
special visitor. Now do you remember when I told you your daddy dies in
a P.O.W. camp?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Well this here is Capt. Koons. He was in the
P.O.W. camp with Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>capt. koons</strong>: Hello, little man. Boy I sure heard a
bunch about you. See, I was a good friend of your Daddy’s. We were in
that Hanoi pit of hell over five years together. Hopefully, you’ll never
have to experience this yourself, but when two men are in a situation
like me and your Daddy were, for as long as we were, you take on certain
responsibilities of the other. If it had been me who had not made it,
Major Coolidge would be talkin’ right now to my son Jim. But the way it
worked out is I’m talkin’ to you, Butch. I got somethin’ for ya.</p>
<p><strong>capt. koons</strong>: This watch I got here was first
purchased by your great-granddaddy. It was bought during the First World
War in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought by
private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It was
your great-granddaddy’s war watch, made by the first company to ever
make wrist watches. You see, up until then, people just carried pocket
watches. Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the
war. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great-
grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol’ coffee
can. And in that can it stayed ‘til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was
called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once
again. This time they called it World War Two. Your great-granddaddy
gave it to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane’s luck
wasn’t as good as his old man’s. Your granddad was a Marine and he was
killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your
granddad was facing death and he knew it. None of those boys had any
illusions about ever leavin’ that island alive. So three days before the
Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on
an Air Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in
his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the
flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your grandfather was dead. But
Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your
grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad’s gold watch.
This watch. This watch was on your Daddy’s wrist when he was shot down
over Hanoi. He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he
knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it’d be confiscated. The way your
Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. And he’d be damned
if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy’s
birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide
somethin’. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then
when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid with
uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven
years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the
watch to you.</p>
<p><strong>klondike</strong>: It’s time, Butch.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I’m ready.</p>
<p><strong>sportscaster #1</strong>: � Well Dan, that had to be the
bloodiest and, hands-down, the most brutal fight this city has ever
seen.</p>
<p><strong>sportscaster #1</strong>: …Coolidge was out of there faster
than I’ve ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring. Do you think he
knew Willis was dead?</p>
<p><strong>sportscaster #2</strong>: My guess would be yes, Richard. I
could see from my position here, the frenzy in his eyes give way to the
realization of what he was doing. I think any man would’ve left the ring
that fast.</p>
<p><strong>sportscaster #1</strong>: Do you feel this ring death tragedy
will have an effect on the world of boxing?</p>
<p><strong>sportscaster #2</strong>: Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can’t
help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundation. But it’s of
paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the
W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the �</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: Are you the man I was supposed to pick
up?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: If you’re the cab I called, I’m the guy
you’re supposed to pick up.</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Outta here.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Mia. How you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>mia</strong>: Great. I never thanked you for the dinner.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: What’cha got?</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: He booked.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: I’m prepared to scour the earth for this
motherfucker. If Butch goes to Indo China, I want a nigger hidin’ in a
bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass.</p>
<p><strong>english dave</strong>: I’ll take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Hey, how do I open the window back here?</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: I have to do it.</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: Hey, mister?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: You were in that fight? The fight on the
radio � you’re the fighter?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Whatever gave you that idea?</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: No c’mon, you’re him, I know you’re him,
tell me you’re him.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I’m him.</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: You killed the other boxing man.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: He’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: The radio said he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Sorry ’bout that, Floyd.</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: What does it feel like?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What does what feel like?</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: Killing a man. Beating another man to
death with your bare hands.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Are you some kinda weirdo?</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: No, it’s a subject I have much interest
in. You are the first person I ever met who has killed somebody. So,
what was it like to kill a man?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Tell ya what, you give me one of them
cigarettes, I’ll give you an answer.</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: Deal!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: …Esmarelda Villalobos � is that Mexican?</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: The name is Spanish, but I’m
Columbian.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: It’s a very pretty name.</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: It mean “Esmarelda of the wolves.”</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: That’s one hell of a name you got there,
sister.</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: Thank you. And what is your name?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Butch.</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: Butch. What does it mean?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I’m an American, our names don’t mean shit.
Anyway, moving right along, what is it you wanna know, Esmarelda?</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: I want to know what it feels like to kill
a man �</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: � I couldn’t tell ya. I didn’t know he was
dead ’til you told me he was dead. Now I know he’s dead, do you wanna
know how I feel about it?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I don’t feel the least little bit bad.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What’d I tell ya, soon as the word got out a
fix was in, the odds would be outta control. Hey, if he was a better
fighter he’s be alive. If he never laced up his gloves in the first
place, which he never shoulda done, he’d be alive. Enough about the poor
unfortunate Mr. Floyd, let’s talk about the rich and prosperous
Mr. Butch. How many bookies you spread it around with?</p>
<p>****: Eight? How long to collect? So by tomorrow evening, you’ll have
it all? Good news Scotty, real good news � I understand a few stragglers
aside. Me an’ Fabienne’re gonna leave in the morning. It should take us
a couple days to get into Knoxville. Next time we see each other, it’ll
be on Tennessee time.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Fabienne my love, our adventure begins.</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: Forty-five sixty.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Merci beaucoup. And here’s a little something
for the effort.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Now if anybody should ask you about who your
fare was tonight, what’re you gonna tell ’em?</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: The truth. Three well-dressed, slightly
toasted, Mexicans.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Bon soir, Esmarelda.</p>
<p><strong>esmarelda</strong>: Sleep well, Butch.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Keep the light off.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Is that better, sugar pop?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Oui. Hard day at the office?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Pretty hard. I got into a fight.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Poor baby. Can we make spoons?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I was looking at myself in the mirror.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Uh-huh?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I wish I had a pot.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You were lookin’ in the mirror and you wish
you had some pot?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: A pot. A pot belly. Pot bellies are
sexy.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well you should be happy, ’cause you do.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Shut up, Fatso! I don’t have a pot! I have
a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did “Lucky Star,” it’s not the
same thing.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I didn’t realize there was a difference
between a tummy and a pot belly.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: The difference is huge.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You want me to have a pot?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: No. Pot bellies make a man look either
oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The
rest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal
ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I’d wear a
tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You think guys would find that
attractive?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I don’t give a damn what men find
attractive. It’s unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and
pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: If you a pot belly, I’d punch you in it.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: You’d punch me in my belly?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Right in the belly.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I’d smother you. I’d drop it on your right
on your face ’til you couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You’d do that to me?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Did you get everything, sugar pop?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Yes, I did.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Good job.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Did everything go as planned?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You didn’t listen to the radio?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I never listen to your fights. Were you
the winner?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I won alright.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Are you still retiring?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Sure am.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: What about the man you fought?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Floyd retired too.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Really?! He won’t be fighting no
more?!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Not no more.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: So it all worked out in the finish?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: We ain’t at the finish, baby.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: We’re in a lot of danger, aren’t we?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: If they find us, they’ll kill us, won’t
they?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: But they won’t find us, will they?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Do you still want me to go with you?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I don’t want to be a burden or a nuisance
-</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Say it!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Fabienne, I want you to be with me.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Forever?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: …and ever.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Oui.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Butch? Will you give me oral pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Will you kiss it?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: But you first.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Butch my love, the adventure begins.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I think I cracked a rib.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Giving me oral pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: No retard, from the fight.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Don’t call me retard.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: My name is Fabby! My name is Fabby!</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Shut up fuck head! I hate that Mongoloid
voice.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, I take it back!
Can I have a towel please, Miss Beautiful Tulip.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Oh I like that, I like being called a
tulip. Tulip is much better than Mongoloid.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I didn’t call you a Mongoloid, I called you a
retard, but I took it back.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Merci beaucoup.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Butch?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yes, lemon pie.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Where are we going to go?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I’m not sure yet. Wherever you want. We’re
gonna get a lot of money from this. But it ain’t gonna be so much, we
can live like hogs in the fat house forever. I was thinking we could go
somewhere in the South Pacific. The kinda money we’ll have’ll carry us a
long way down there.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: So if we wanted, we could live in Bora
Bora?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You betcha. And if after awhile you don’t dig
Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: But I do not speak Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You don’t speak Bora Boran either. Besides,
Mexican is easy: Donde esta el zapataria?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Where’s the shoe store?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Donde esta el zapataria?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Excellent pronunciation. You’ll be my little
mama ceta in no time.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Que hora es?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Que hora es?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Time for bed. Sweet dream, jellybean.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Butch.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>on tv</strong>: WILLIAM SMITH and a BUNCH OF HELL’S ANGELS
are taking on the entire Vietnamese army in the film “THE LOSERS”.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad
dream?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What are you watching?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: A motorcycle movie, I’m not sure the
name.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Are you watchin’ it?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: In a way. Why? Would you like for me to
switch it off?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Would you please?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: It’s a little too early in the morning for
explosions and war.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: What was it about?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: How should I know, you were the one watchin’
it.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: No, imbecile, what was your dream
about?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Oh, I… don’t remember. It’s really rare I
remember a dream.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: You just woke up from it.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Fabienne, I’m not lying to you, I don’t
remember.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Well, let’s look at the grumpy man in the
morning. I didn’t say you were lying, it’s just odd you don’t remember
your dreams. I always remember mine. Did you know you talk in your
sleep?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I don’t talk in my sleep, do I talk in my
sleep?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: You did last night.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I don’t know. I couldn’t understand
you.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Why don’t you get up and we’ll get some
breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: One more kiss and I’ll get up.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Then get up, lazy bones.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What time is it?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Almost nine in the morning. What time does
our train arrive?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Eleven.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I’m gonna order a big plate of blueberry
pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Anything to drink with that?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall
glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee. After that, I’m going
to have a slice of pie.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Pie for breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Any time of the day is a good time for
pie. Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes. And on top, a thin slice of
melted cheese �</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: � where’s my watch?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: It’s there.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: No, it’s not. It’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Have you looked?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Yes I’ve fuckin’ looked!!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What the fuck do you think I’m doing?! Are
you sure you got it?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Uhhh… yes… beside the table drawer �</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: � on the little kangaroo.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well it’s not here!</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Well it should be!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Oh it most definitely should be here, but
it’s not. So where is it?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Fabienne, that was my father’s fuckin’ watch.
You know what my father went through to git me that watch?… I don’t
wanna get into it right now… but he went through a lot. Now all this
other shit, you coulda set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not
to forget my father’s watch. Now think, did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I believe so…</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You believe so? You either did, or you
didn’t, now which one is it?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Then I did.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: No! It’s not your fault. You left it at the
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: If you did leave it at the apartment, it’s
not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff. I reminded you about
it, but I didn’t illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I
gave a fuck about was my watch, I should’ve told you. You ain’t a mind
reader.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Don’t be. It just means I won’t be able to
eat breakfast with you.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Why does it mean that?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Because I’m going back to my apartment to get
my watch.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Won’t the gangsters be looking for you
there?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: That’s what I’m gonna find out. If they are,
and I don’t think I can handle it, I’ll split.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, I
thought I brought it. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Don’t feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you could
ever do would make me permanently angry at you. I love you, remember?
Now here’s some money, order those pancakes and have a great
breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Don’t go.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I’ll be back before you can say, blueberry
pie.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Blueberry pie.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay?
Okay?</p>

<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I’m gonna take your Honda.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Of all the fuckin’ things she coulda forgot,
she forgets my father’s watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget
it. “Bedside table � on the kangaroo.” I said the words: “Don’t forget
my father’s watch.”</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: That’s how you’re gonna beat ‘em, Butch. They
keep underestimatin’ ya.</p>
<p><strong>double-take</strong>: “Am I really seeing what I’m
seeing?”</p>
<p><strong>pedestrian</strong>: Jesus, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>gawker #1</strong>: He’s dead! He’s dead!</p>
<p><strong>gawker #2</strong>: If you need a witness in court, I’ll be
glad to help. He was a drunken maniac. He hit you and crashed into that
car.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>gawker #2</strong>: Him.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Well, I’ll be damned.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Sacre bleu.</p>
<p><strong>looky-loo woman</strong>: Oh my God, I’ve been shot!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Can I help you wit’ somethin’?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Now you just wait one goddamn minute �</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: So you like chasing people, huh?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Well guess what, big man, you caught me �</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: � hold it right there, godammit!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Look mister, this ain’t any of your business

<p><strong>maynard</strong>: � I’m makin’ it my business! Now toss that
gun!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Now you on top, stand up and come to the
counter.</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Zed? It’s Maynard. The spider just caught a
coupl’a flies.</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Nobody kills anybody in my place of
business except me or Zed.</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: That’s Zed.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You said you waited for me?</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Then how come they’re all beat up?</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: They did that to each other. They was
fightin’ when they came in. This one was gonna shoot that one.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You were gonna shoot him?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front of this
place?</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Yeah, it ain’t Tuesday is it?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: No, it’s Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Then she’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Bring out The Gimp.</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: I think The Gimp’s sleepin’.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Well, I guess you’ll just wake ’em up then,
won’t you?</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Down!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Who’s first?</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: I ain’t fer sure yet.</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: Wanna do it here?</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Naw, drag big boy to Russell’s old
room.</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Up!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Keep an eye on this one.</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: Whoa, this boy’s got a bit of fight in
’em!</p>
<p><strong>zed</strong>: You wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I like
to fight!</p>
<p><strong>maynard</strong>: That’s it… that’s it boy, you’re goin’
fine. Oooooooh, just like that… that’s good. Stay still… stay still
goddamn ya! Zed goddammit, git over here and hold ’em!</p>
<p><strong>the gimp</strong>: Huhng?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Hey hillbilly.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Step aside, Butch.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Naw man. I’m pretty fuckin’ far from
okay!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: What now? Well let me tell you what now.
I’m gonna call a couple pipe- hittin’ niggers, who’ll go to work on
homes here with a pair of pliers and a blow torch. Hear me talkin’
hillbilly boy?! I ain’t through with you by a damn sight. I’m gonna git
Medieval on your ass.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I meant what now, between me and you?</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Oh, that what now? Well, let me tell ya
what now between me an’ you. There is no me an’ you. Not no more.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: So we’re cool?</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Yeah man, we’re cool. One thing I ask �
two things I ask: Don’t tell nobody about this. This shit’s between me
and you and the soon-to-be-livin’- the-rest-of-his-short-ass-life-in-
agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It ain’t nobody else’s business. Two:
leave town. Tonight. Right now. And when you’re gone, stay gone. You’ve
lost your Los Angeles privileges. Deal?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Go on now, get your ass outta here.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Hello Mr. Wolf, it’s Marsellus. Gotta bit
of a situation.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Butch, I was so worried!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Honey, grab your radio and your purse and
let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: But what about all our bags?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Fuck the bags. We’ll miss our train if we
don’t split now.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Is everything well? Are we in danger?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: We’re cool. In fact, we’re super- cool. But
we gots to go. I’ll wait for you outside.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Where did you get this motorcycle?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: It’s a chopper, baby, hop on.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: What happened to my Honda?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Sorry baby, I crashed the Honda.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: You’re hurt?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I might’ve broke my nose, no biggie. Hop
on.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin’ road!</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I’m sorry, baby-love.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: You were gone so long, I started to think
dreadful thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: I’m sorry I worried you, sweetie.
Everything’s fine. Hey, how was breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: It was good �</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: � did you get the blueberry pancakes?</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: No, they didn’t have blueberry pancakes, I
had to get buttermilk � are you sure you’re okay?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Baby-love, from the moment I left you, this
has been without a doubt the single weirdest day of my entire life.
Climb on an’ I’ll tell ya about it.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Butch, whose motorcycle is this?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: It’s a chopper.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Whose chopper is this?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Zed’s.</p>
<p><strong>fabienne</strong>: Who’s Zed?</p>
<p><strong>butch</strong>: Zed’s dead, baby, Zed’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You ever read the Bible, Brett?</p>
<p><strong>brett</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: There’s a passage I got memorized, seems
appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. “The path of the
righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and
the tyranny of evil men…”</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: “…blessed is he who, in the name of charity
and good will, shepherded the weak through the valley of darkness. And I
will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those
who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am
the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you.”</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Friend of yours?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>fourth man</strong>: Die… die… die… die…!</p>
<p><strong>fourth man</strong>: I don’t understand �</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why the fuck didn’t you tell us about that
guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind? Forget he was in there with a
goddamn hand cannon?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We should be fuckin’ dead right now. Did you
see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: .357.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We should be fuckin’ dead!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah, we were lucky.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That shit wasn’t luck. That shit was
somethin’ else.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That was… divine intervention. You know what
divine intervention is?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yeah, I think so. That means God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Yeah, man, that’s what is means. That’s
exactly what it means! God came down from Heaven and stopped the
bullets.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I think we should be going now.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Don’t do that! Don’t you fuckin’ do that!
Don’t blow this shit off! What just happened was a fuckin’ miracle!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Chill the fuck out, Jules, this shit
happens.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Wrong, wrong, this shit doesn’t just
happen.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Do you wanna continue this theological
discussion in the car, or at the jailhouse with the cops?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We should be fuckin’ dead now, my friend! We
just witnessed a miracle, and I want you to fuckin’ acknowledge it!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Okay man, it was a miracle, can we leave
now?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: …Ever seen that show “COPS?” I was watchin’
it once and this cop was on it who was talkin’ about this time he got
into this gun fight with a guy in a hallway. He unloads on this guy and
he doesn’t hit anything. And these guys were in a hallway. It’s a freak,
but it happens.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: If you wanna play blind man, then go walk
with a Shepherd. But me, my eyes are wide fuckin’ open.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What the fuck does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That’s it for me. For here on in, you can
consider my ass retired.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Jesus Christ!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Don’t blaspheme!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Goddammit, Jules �</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: � I said don’t do that �</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: � you’re fuckin’ freakin’ out!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I’m tellin’ Marsellus today I’m through.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: While you’re at it, be sure to tell ’im
why.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Don’t worry, I will.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’ll bet ya ten thousand dollars, he laughs
his ass off.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I don’t give a damn if he does.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Marvin, what do you make of all this?</p>
<p><strong>marvin</strong>: I don’t even have an opinion.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: C’mon, Marvin. Do you think God came down
from Heaven and stopped the bullets?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What the fuck’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I just accidentally shot Marvin in the
throat.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Why the fuck did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I didn’t mean to do it. I said it was an
accident.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I’ve seen a lot of crazy-ass shit in my time
�</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: � chill out, man, it was an accident, okay?
You hit a bump or somethin’ and the gun went off.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: The car didn’t hit no motherfuckin’ bump!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Look! I didn’t mean to shoot this
son-ofa-bitch, the gun just went off, don’t ask me how!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Look at this mess! We’re drivin’ around on a
city street in broad daylight �</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: � I know, I know, I wasn’t thinkin’ about
the splatter.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well you better be thinkin’ about it now,
motherfucker! We gotta get this car off the road. Cops tend to notice
shit like you’re driving a car drenched in fuckin’ blood.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Can’t we just take it to a friendly
place?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: This is the Valley, Vincent. Marsellus don’t
got no friendly places in the Valley.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Well, don’t look at me, this is your town,
Jules.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Who ya callin’?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Where’s Toluca Lake.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: On the other side of the hill, by Burbank
Studios. If Jimmie’s ass ain’t home, I don’t know what the fuck we’re
gonna go. I ain’t got any other partners in 818. Jimmie! How you doin’
man, it’s Jules. Listen up man, me an’ my homeboy are in some serious
shit. We’re in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use
your garage for a couple hours.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We gotta be real fuckin’ delicate with this
Jimmie’s situation. He’s one remark away from kickin’ our asses out the
door.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: If he kicks us out, whadda we do?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Well, we ain’t leavin’ ‘til we made a couple
phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie’s my friend
and you don’t bust in your friend’s house and start tellin’ ’im what’s
what.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Just tell ’im not to be abusive. He kinda
freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Put yourself in his position. It’s eight
o’clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn’t prepared for this
shit. Don’t forget who’s doin’ who a favor.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: If the price of that favor is I gotta take
shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What the fuck did you just do to his
towel?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I was just dryin’ my hands.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You’re supposed to wash ’em first.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You watched me wash ’em.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I watched you get ’em wet.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I washed ’em. Blood’s real hard to get off.
Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I used the same soap you did and when I dried
my hands, the towel didn’t look like a fuckin’ Maxie pad. Look, fuck it,
alright. Who cares? But it’s shit like this that’s gonna bring this
situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like
that… I’m tellin’ you Vincent, you best be cool. ‘Cause if I gotta get
in to it with Jimmie on account of you… Look, I ain’t threatenin’ you, I
respect you an’ all, just don’t put me in that position.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem.
He’s your friend, you handle him.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet
shit. Me an’ Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters
Choice. You spring this gourmet fuckin’ shit on us. What flavor is
this?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Knock it off, Julie.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: I’m not a cobb or corn, so you can stop
butterin’ me up. I don’t need you to tell me how good my coffee is. I’m
the one who buys it, I know how fuckin’ good it is. When Bonnie goes
shoppin;, she buys shit. I buy the gourmet expensive stuff ’cause when I
drink it, I wanna taste it. But what’s on my mind at this moment isn’t
the coffee in my kitchen, it’s the dead nigger in my garage.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Jimmie �</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: � I’m talkin’. Now let me ask you a
question, Jules. When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front
that said, “Dead nigger storage?”</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: � answer to question. Did you see a sign out
in front of my house that said, “Dead nigger storage?”</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Naw man, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: You know why you didn’t see that sign?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: ‘Cause storin’ dead niggers ain’t my fuckin’
business!</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: � I ain’t through! Now don’t you understand
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I’m gonna
get divorced. No marriage counselor, no trial separation � fuckin’
divorced. And I don’t wanna get fuckin’ divorced. The last time me an’
Bonnie talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me an’ Bonnie
talked about this shit. Now I wanna help ya out Julie, I really do. But
I ain’t gonna lose my wife doin’ it.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Jimmie �</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: � don’t fuckin’ Jimmie me, man, I can’t be
Jimmied. There’s nothin’ you can say that’s gonna make me forget I love
my wife. Now she’s workin’ the graveyard shift at the hospital. She’ll
be comin’ home in less than an hour and a half. Make your phone calls,
talk to your people, than get the fuck out of my house.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That’s all we want. We don’t wanna fuck up
your shit. We just need to call our people to bring us in.</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Then I suggest you get to it. Phone’s in my
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: …well, say she comes home. Whaddya think
she’ll do? No fuckin’ shit she’ll freak. That ain’t no kinda answer. You
know ’er, I don’t. How bad, a lot or a little?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You got to appreciate what an explosive
element this Bonnie situation is. If she comes home from a hard day’s
work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin’ a bunch of gangsta’ shit in
her kitchen, ain’t no tellin’ what she’s apt to do.</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: I’ve grasped that, Jules. All I’m doin’
is contemplating the “ifs.”</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I don’t wanna hear about no motherfuckin’
“ifs.”What I wanna hear from your ass is: “you ain’t got no problems,
Jules. I’m on the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out
and wait for the cavalry, which should be comin’ directly.”</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: You ain’t got no problems, Jules. I’m on
the motherfucker. Go back in there, chill them niggers out and wait for
The Wolf, who should be comin’ directly.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You sendin’ The Wolf?</p>
<p><strong>marsellus</strong>: Feel better?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Shit Negro, that’s all you had to say.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Is she the hysterical type? When she due?
Give me the principals’ names again? Jules…</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: …Vincent… Jimmie… Bonnie…</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Expect a call around 10:30. It’s about
thirty minutes away. I’ll be there in ten.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: You’re Jimmie, right? This is your
house?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: I’m Winston Wolf, I solve problems.</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Good, ’cause we got one.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: So I heard. May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Please do.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: You must be Jules, which would make you
Vincent. Let’s get down to brass tacks, gentlemen. If I was informed
correctly, the clock is ticking, is that right, Jimmie?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: 100%.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Your wife, Bonnie… …comes home at 9:30 in
the AM, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: I was led to believe if she comes home and
finds us here, she wouldn’t appreciate it none too much.</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: She won’t at that.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: That gives us forty minutes to get the
fuck outta Dodge, which, if you do what I say when I say it, should by
plenty. Now you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take
me to it.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Jimmie?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled
some coffee in there. Would you make me a cup?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Sure, how do you take it?</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: About the car, is there anything I need to
know? Does it stall, does it make a lot of noise, does it smoke, is
there gas in it, anything?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Aside from how it looks, the car’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Positive? Don’t get me out on the road and
I find out the brake lights don’t work.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Hey man, as far as I know, the motherfucker’s
tip-top.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Good enough, let’s go back to the
kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Thank you, Jimmie.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Okay first thing, you two. Take the body,
stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty
domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the garage or
under the sink, you got a bunch of cleansers and cleaners and shit like
that, am I correct?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Good. What I need you two fellas to do is
take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I’m
talkin’ fast, fast, fast. You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all
those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there. Wipe down
the upholstery � now when it comes to upholstery, it don’t need to be
spic and span, you don’t need to eat off it. Give it a good once over.
What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of
blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up. But the windows
are a different story. Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good
job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. I need blankets, I
need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the
better, the darker the better. No whites, can’t use ‘em. We need to
camouflage the interior of the car. We’re gonna line the front seat and
the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. If a cop
stops us and starts stickin’ his big snout in the car, the subterfuge
won’t last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal. Jimmie �
lead the way, boys � get to work.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: A “please” would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Come again?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I said a “please” would be nice.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Set is straight, Buster. I’m not here to
say “please.”I’m here to tell you want to do. And if self- preservation
is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin’ do it and do it quick.
I’m here to help. If my help’s not appreciated, lotsa luck
gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: It ain’t that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is
definitely appreciated.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I don’t mean any disrespect. I just don’t
like people barkin’ orders at me.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: If I’m curt with you, it’s because time is
a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if
you want to get out of this. So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean
the fuckin’ car.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: It’s a 1974 Chevy Nova. White. Nothin’,
except for the mess inside. About twenty minutes. Nobody who’ll be
missed. You’re a good man, Joe. See ya soon. How we comin’, Jimmie?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin’
�</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: � Winston, Jimmie � please, Winston.</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: You gotta understand something, Winston. I
want to help you guys out and all, but that’s my best linen. It was a
wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain’t with
us anymore �</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: � let me ask you a question, if you don’t
mind?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny
millionaires?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I’m
positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would’ve
furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is
more than happy to do. I like oak myself, that’s what’s in my bedroom.
How ’bout you Jimmie, you an oak man?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Oak’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I will never forgive your ass for this shit.
This is some fucked-up repugnant shit!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Did you ever hear the philosophy that once
a man admits he’s wrong, he’s immediately forgiven for all
wrong-doings?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Man, get outta my face with that shit! The
motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of
skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold
for the abuse I’ll take. And you’re crossin’ it. I’m a race car and you
got me in the red. Redline 7000, that’s where you are. Just know, it’s
fuckin’ dangerous to be drivin’ a race car when it’s in the red. It
could blow.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You’re gettin’ ready to blow? I’m a
mushroom-cloud-layin’ motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain
I’m “SUPERFLY T.N.T,” I’m the “GUNS OF NAVARONE.” I’m what Jimmie Walker
usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin’ in the back? You’re
the motherfucker should be on brain detail. We’re tradin’. I’m washin’
windows and you’re pickin’ up this nigger’s skull.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out of
this yet.</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: I can’t believe that’s the same car.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Well, let’s not start suckin’ each other’s
dicks quite yet. Phase one is complete, clean the car, which moves us
right along to phase two, clean you two.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Strip.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: All the way?</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: To your bare ass.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Quickly gentlemen, we got about fifteen
minutes before Jimmie’s better- half comes pulling into the
driveway.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: This morning air is some chilly shit.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Are you sure this is absolutely
necessary?</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: You know what you two look like?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Like a couple of guys who just blew off
somebody’s head. Yes, strippin’ off those bloody rags is absolutely
necessary. Toss the clothes in Jim’s garbage bag.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Now Jimmie, don’t do nothin’ stupid like
puttin’ that out in front of your house for Elmo the garbage man to take
away.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Don’t worry, we’re takin’ it with us. Jim,
the soap.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Okay gentlemen, you’re both been to County
before, I’m sure. Here it comes.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Goddamn, that water’s fuckin’ cold!</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Better you than me, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Don’t be afraid of the soap, spread it
around.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Towel ’em.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: You’re dry enough, give ’em their
clothes.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Perfect. Perfect. We couldn’t’ve planned
this better. You guys look like… what do they look like, Jimmie?</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Ha ha ha. They’re your clothes,
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>jimmie</strong>: I guess you just gotta know how to wear
them.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Yeah, well, our asses ain’t the expert on
wearin’ dorky shit that your is.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: C’mon, gentlemen, we’re laughin’ and
jokin’ our way into prison. Don’t make me beg.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Gentlemen, let’s get our rules of the road
straight. We’re going to a place called Monster Joe’s Truck and Tow.
Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to out dilemma. The
place is North Hollywood, so a few twist and turns aside, we’ll be goin’
up Hollywood Way. Now I’ll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with
me. Vincent, you follow in my Porsche. Now if we cross the path of any
John Q. Laws, nobody does a fuckin’ thing ’til I do something.</p>
<p>****: What did I say?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Don’t do shit unless �</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: � unless what?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Unless you do it first.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Spoken like a true prodigy. How ’bout you,
Lash Larue? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I’m cool, Mr. Wolf. My gun just went off, I
dunno how.</p>
<p><strong>the wolf</strong>: Fair enough. I drive real fuckin’ fast, so
keep up. If I get my car back any different than I gave it, Monster
Joe’s gonna be disposing of two bodies.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We cool?</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Like it never happened.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Boys, this is Raquel. Someday, all this
will be hers.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: Hi. You know, if they ever do “I</p>
<p><strong>spy</strong>: THE MOTION PICTURE,” you guys, I’d be great.
What’s with the outfits. You guys going to a volleyball game?</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: I’m takin’ m’lady out to breakfast. Maybe I
can drop you two off. Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Redondo Beach.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Inglewood.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: It’s your future: I see… a cab ride. Sorry
guys, move out of the sticks. Say goodbye, Raquel.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: Goodbye, Raquel.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: I’ll see you two around, and stay outta
trouble, you crazy kids.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Mr. Wolf.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I was a pleasure watchin’ you work.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Call me Winston.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: You hear that, young lady? Respect. You
could lean a lot from those two fine specimens. Respect for one’s elders
shows character.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: I have character.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Just because you are a character doesn’t
mean you have character.</p>
<p><strong>raquel</strong>: Oh you’re so funny, oh you’re so funny.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Wanna share a cab?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: You know I could go for some breakfast.
Want to have breakfast with me?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Thanks a bunch. Want a sausage?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Naw, I don’t eat pork.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Are you Jewish?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I ain’t Jewish man, I just don’t dig on
swine.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: They’re filthy animals. I don’t eat filthy
animals.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste
good.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. I’ll
never know ‘cause even if it did, I wouldn’t eat the filthy
motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That’s a filthy animal. I
don’t wanna eat nothin’ that ain’t got enough sense to disregard its own
feces.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How about dogs? Dogs eat their own
feces.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I don’t eat dog either.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a
filthy animal?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I wouldn’t go so far as to call a dog filthy,
but they’re definitely dirty. But a dog’s got personality. And
personality goes a long way.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So by that rationale, if a pig had a better
personality, he’s cease to be a filthy animal?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: We’d have to be talkin’ ‘bout one
motherfuckin’ charmin’ pig. It’d have to be the Cary Grant of pigs.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been
sittin’ there all quiet.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I just been sittin’ here thinkin’.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: The miracle we witnessed.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a
freak occurrence.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Do you know that a miracle is?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: An act of God.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What’s an act of God?</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I guess it’s when God makes the impossible
possible. And I’m sorry Jules, but I don’t think what happened this
morning qualifies.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Don’t you see, Vince, that shit don’t matter.
You’re judging this thing the wrong way. It’s not about what. It could
be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my
fuckin’ car keys. You don’t judge shit like this based on merit. Whether
or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is
insignificant. What is significant is I felt God’s touch, God got
involved.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That’s what’s fuckin’ wit’ me! I don’t know
why. But I can’t go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So you’re serious, you’re really gonna
quit?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: The life, most definitely.</p>
<p><strong>patron</strong>: Garcon! Coffee!</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So if you’re quitting the life, what’ll you
do?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That’s what I’ve been sitting here
contemplating. First, I’m gonna deliver this case to Marsellus. Then,
basically, I’m gonna walk the earth.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What do you mean, walk the earth?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You know, like Caine in “KUNG FU.” Just walk
from town to town, meet people, get in adventures.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: How long do you intend to walk the
earth?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Until God puts me where he want me to be.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What if he never does?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: If it takes forever, I’ll wait forever.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: So you decided to be a bum?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I’ll just be Jules, Vincent � no more, no
less.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: No Jules, you’re gonna be like those pieces
of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of
fuckin’ zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away,
and dogs piss on ‘em. They got a word for ’em, they’re called bums. And
without a job, residence, or legal tender, that’s what you’re gonna be �
a fuckin’ bum!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Look my friend, this is just where me and you
differ �</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: � what happened was peculiar � no doubt
about it � but it wasn’t water into wine.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: All shapes and sizes, Vince.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Stop fuckin’ talkin’ like that!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: If you find my answers frightening, Vincent,
you should cease askin’ scary questions.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I gotta take a shit. To be continued.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Everybody be cool, this is a robbery!</p>
<p><strong>honey bunny</strong>: Any of you fuckin’ pricks move and I’ll
execute every one of you motherfuckers! Got that?!</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Customers stay seated, waitresses on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>honey bunny</strong>: Now mean fuckin’ now! Do it or die, do
it or fucking die!</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: You Mexicans in the kitchen, get out here!
Asta luego!</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: On the floor or I’ll cook you ass,
comprende?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’m the manager here, there’s no problem,
no problem at all �</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: You’re gonna give me a problem?</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: What? You said you’re gonna give me a
problem?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: No, I’m not. I’m not gonna give you any
problem!</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: I don’t know, Honey Bunny. He looks like
the hero type to me!</p>
<p><strong>honey bunny</strong>: Don’t take any chances. Execute
him!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Please don’t! I’m not a hero. I’m just a
coffee shop manager. Take anything you want.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Tell everyone to cooperate and it’ll be all
over.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Everybody just be calm and cooperate with
them and this will be all over soon!</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Well done, now git your fuckin’ ass on the
ground.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Okay people, I’m going to go ’round and
collect your wallets. Don’t talk, just toss ’em in the bag. We
clear?</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: In the bag.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: What’s in that?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: My boss’ dirty laundry.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: You boss makes you do his laundry?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: When he wants it clean.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Sounds like a shit job.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Funny, I’ve been thinkin’ the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Open it up.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: ’Fraid I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: I didn’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Yes, you did.</p>
<p><strong>honey bunny</strong>: What’s goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Looks like we got a vigilante in our
midst.</p>
<p><strong>honey bunny</strong>: Shoot ’em in the face!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: I don’t mean to shatter your ego, but this
ain’t the first time I’ve had gun pointed at me.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: You don’t open up that case, it’s gonna be
the last.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Quit causing problems, you’ll get us all
killed! Give ’em what you got and get ’em out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Keep your fuckin’ mouth closed, fat man, this
ain’t any of your goddamn business!</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: I’m countin’ to three, and if your hand
ain’t off that case, I’m gonna unload right in your fuckin’ face. Clear?
One…</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: …two… three.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You win.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: It’s all yours, Ringo.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>honey bunny</strong>: What is it? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Is that what I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>honey bunny</strong>: Goddammit, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>honey bunny</strong>: Let him go! Let him go! I’ll blow your
fuckin’ head off! I’ll kill ya! I’ll kill ya! You’re gonna die, you’re
gonna fuckin’ die bad!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be
cool! Say, bitch be cool!</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Chill out, honey!</p>
<p><strong>honey bunny</strong>: Let him go!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Tell her it’s gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: I’m gonna be okay.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Promise her.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: I promise.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Tell her to chill.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Just chill out.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Yolanda.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: So, we cool Yolanda? We ain’t gonna do
anything stupid, are we?</p>
<p><strong>yolanda</strong>: Don’t you hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Nobody’s gonna hurt anybody. We’re gonna be
like three Fonzies. And what’ Fonzie like?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: C’mon Yolanda, what’s Fonzie like?</p>
<p><strong>yolanda</strong>: He’s cool?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Correct-amundo! And that’s what we’re gonna
be, we’re gonna be cool. Now Ringo, I’m gonna count to three and I want
you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. But when
you do it, do it cool. Ready?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: One… two… three.</p>
<p><strong>yolanda</strong>: Okay, now let him go!</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool.
When you yell at me, it makes me nervous. When I get nervous, I get
scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that’s when motherfuckers get
accidentally shot.</p>
<p><strong>yolanda</strong>: Just know: you hurt him, you die.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That seems to be the situation. Now I don’t
want that and you don’t want that and Ringo here don’t want that. So
let’s see what we can do. Now this is the situation. Normally both of
your asses would be dead as fuckin’ fried chicken. But you happened to
pull this shit while I’m in a transitional period. I don’t wanna kill
ya, I want to help ya. But I’m afraid I can’t give you the case. It
don’t belong to me. Besides, I went through too much shit this morning
on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What the fuck’s goin’ on here?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: It’s cool, Vincent! It’s cool! Don’t do a
goddamn thing. Yolanda, it’s cool baby, nothin’s changed. We’re still
just talkin’. Tell her we’re still cool.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: It’s cool, Honey Bunny, we’re still
cool.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: What the hell’s goin’ on, Jules?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Nothin’ I can’t handle. I want you to just
hang back and don’t do shit unless it’s absolutely necessary.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Yolanda, how we doin, baby?</p>
<p><strong>yolanda</strong>: I gotta go pee! I want to go home.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Just hang in there, baby, you’re doing’
great, Ringo’s proud of you and so am I. It’s almost over. Now I want
you to go in that bag and find my wallet.</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Which one is it?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: It’s the one that says Bad Motherfucker on
it.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That’s my bad motherfucker. Now open it up
and take out the cash. How much is there?</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: About fifteen hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Put it in your pocket, it’s yours. Now with
the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty
successful little score.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: Jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen
hundred buck, I’m gonna shoot ’em on general principle.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: You ain’t gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang
back and shut the fuck up. Besides, I ain’t givin’ it to him. I’m buyin’
somethin’ for my money. Wanna know what I’m buyin’ Ringo?</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: Your life. I’m givin’ you that money so I
don’t hafta kill your ass. You read the Bible?</p>
<p><strong>pumpkin</strong>: Not regularly.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: There’s a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel
25:17. “The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the
inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he
who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through
the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother’s keeper and the
finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my
brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon
you.” I been sayin’ that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it
meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it
was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker ‘fore you popped a
cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin’ made me think twice.
Now I’m thinkin’, it could mean you’re the evil man. And I’m the
righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he’s the shepherd protecting my
righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you’re the
righteous man and I’m the shepherd and it’s the world that’s evil and
selfish. I’d like that. But that shit ain’t the truth. The truth is
you’re the weak. And I’m the tyranny of evil men. But I’m tryin’. I’m
tryin’ real hard to be a shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: It’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>vincent</strong>: I think we oughta leave now.</p>
<p><strong>jules</strong>: That’s probably a good idea.</p>
