<h1 id="the-doors">the-doors</h1>
<p><strong>morrison’s voice</strong>: The movie will begin in five
moments The mindless voice announced All those unseated will await the
next show We filed slowly, languidly into the hall The auditorium was
fast and silent As we seated and were darkened The voice continued “The
program for this evening is not new You’ve seen this entertainment
Through and through You’ve seen your birth, your life and death You
might recall all the rest Did you have a good world when you died?
Enough to base a movie on?”</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Hey Jim, It’s your birthday man, whaddaya
say we try this another night…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Kill the lights a little more, will ya
John?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Hey man, how come the Doors aren’t in on
this?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No music, No Doors. Let’s roll… Is everybody
in?… Is Everybody in?… Is everybody in? The ceremony is about to
begin…</p>
<p><strong>jim voice</strong>: Let me tell you about the heartache and
the loss of God Wandering wandering in hopeless night Indian’s scattered
on dawn’s highway bleeding ghosts crowd the young childs fragile
eggshell mind…</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Riders on the storm Into this house
we’re born Into this world we’re thrown Like a dog without a bone An
actor out on loan Riders on the storm</p>
<p><strong>jim voice</strong>: …me and my mother and father and
grandmother and grandfather were driving through the desert at dawn and
a truckload of Indian workers had either hit another car or just – I
don’t know what happened… Indians were scattered all over the highway
bleeding to death.</p>
<p><strong>jim voice</strong>: …but it was the first time I tasted fear.
I musta been about four, like a child is just like a flower, his head is
floating in the breeze.</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’s just a dream, Jimmy, just a dream</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: There’s a killer on the road His brain is
squirming like a toad Take a long holiday Let your children play If you
give this man a ride Sweet family will die There’s a killer on the
road</p>
<p><strong>mom</strong>: It’s just a dream Jimmy, just a dream</p>
<p><strong>jim voice</strong>: …The reaction I get now looking back is
the soul of the ghosts of those dead Indians – maybe one or two of them
were just running around freaking out and just leaped into my soul – and
they’re still there.</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: Girl you gotta love your man Take him by the
hand Make him understand</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: The world on you depends Our life will never
end Girl you gotta love your man</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: …from the Texas School Book Depository. We
repeat. President John F. Kennedy was shot a few minutes ago in
Dallas!</p>
<p><strong>slow motion</strong>: The Husband’s face distorting, saying
something on the track like: “What! God NO!” but it’s subdued, low.
Trying other stations.</p>
<p><strong>radio</strong>: …taken to Parkland Memorial Hospital. There’s
no word on the President’s condition. Mrs. Kennedy is…</p>
<p><strong>wife &amp; husband</strong>: Oh God, Oh God. Not the
President for Christ’s sake. Oh God – WHO’S</p>
<p><strong>song</strong>: Riders on the storm</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Hello I love you Won’t you tell me your
name? Hello I love you Let me jump in your game She’s walking down the
street Blind to every eye she meets Do you think you’ll be the guy To
make the queen of the angels sigh?</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: She holds her head so high Like a statue
in the sky Her arms are wicked And her legs are long When she moves My
brain screams out this song</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Sidewalk crouches at her feet Like a dog
that begs for something sweet Do you hope to make her see you, fool? Do
you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: She lives on Love Street Lingers long on
Love Street She has a house and garden I would like to see what
happens</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: She has robes and she has monkeys Lazy
diamond studded flunkies She has wisdom and knows what to do She has me
and she has you</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Wow! Hi… You have a problem with doors?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Waste of time…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I followed you… from the beach…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Wow! You followed me? Why?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …cause… you’re the one…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Wow… neat… …maybe you should meet my old
man?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Later. You got a name?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mine’s Jim.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Pam…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jim and Pam, Pam and Jim…</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: Who the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: That’s Jim. My new friend.</p>
<p><strong>jim’s voice</strong>: Nietzche said “all great things must
first wear monstrous and terrifying masks in order to inscribe
themselves on the hearts of humanity”. Listen children – to the sound of
the Nuremberg night.</p>
<p><strong>jim voice</strong>: Have you ever seen God? – a mandala. A
symmetrical angel. Felt? Yes. Fucking the Sun. Heard? The music. Voices.
Touched? An animal. Your hand Tasted? Rare meat, corn, water and
wine</p>
<p><strong>students</strong>: SSSSssss… ego trip man, c’mon!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey man it’s great, don’t listen to em, it’s
non-linear man, it’s poetry man, everything Godard stands for.</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: This is pretty shocking stuff
Mr. Morrison. And I might say indulgent. Naziism and masturbation, when
used for shock value, are not art. But to be constructive, let’s start
with your intention. What was it?</p>
<p><strong>student 1</strong>: It was a bore!! That’s what!</p>
<p><strong>trick</strong>: Hey it was better’n a Warhol picture.</p>
<p><strong>girl 1</strong>: No it wasn’t. It was worse!</p>
<p><strong>trick</strong>: A guy sleeping for seven hours…</p>
<p><strong>student 2</strong>: …is less pretentious! There was no
political consciousness. Naziism is…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey hold on man! You guys are the facists!</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: It takes genitalism to absurdity man, just
cause the squares here can’t dig it cause the film school’s still so
square…</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Oh c’mon man, give it a break. Boo! Beatniks
go home! Take another mushroom…</p>
<p><strong>instructor</strong>: HOLD IT DOWN!!… Mr. Morrison – what are
your feelings?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I quit.</p>
<p><strong>trick</strong>: Hey man whatdya expect, an Oscar?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: You can’t quit, you gotta voice. People can’t
dig cause they don’t understand yet.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you’re an individual, if you’re too good,
they wanna cut your dick off. Look what happened to Orson Wells.</p>
<p><strong>trick</strong>: You quit now, they’ll yank your deferment in
no time and they’ll get you for Vietnam man. Three more months you
graduate.</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Be cool, you never learned fuckin patience
Morrison, you want everything at once.</p>
<p><strong>nick</strong>: They didn’t get it. So make your films and
fuck what they think.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You know what I think?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Yeah whadday you think?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You really want to know what I think?</p>
<p><strong>bones</strong>: Yeah yeah, whatddaya think?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I think we gotta get really ripped!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I tell you bout my baby ’bout five foot four
from head to toe She came to my room Just ’bout midnight She makes me
feel so good She makes me feel alright</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You know what I’d like to do to you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No what?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You really want to know what I’d like to do to
you?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: What!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wanna hear the scream of the butterfly…</p>
<p><strong>football player</strong>: Hey Morrison!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Can we have a couple of beers. You’re not even
an asshole man – you’re a semihole.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: She came to my room She came on my floor She
came on my bed She came on my face Ooooooh I want to wrap your legs
around my head baby baby and her name was Gloria</p>
<p><strong>special effect</strong>: JIM’s head six inches from pavement
moving at 60 mph through heavy traffic. Screaming, laughing like a
maniac. Beeping horns all over the place.</p>
<p>****: Awake! Shake dreams from your hair, my pretty child my sweet
one Choose the day and choose the sign of your day The day’s divinity
the first thing you see</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on, come out for a walk, it’s a pretty
night.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: You’re crazy!</p>
<p>****: A vast radiant beach And a cool jewelled moon Couples naked,
race down by its quiet side And we laugh like soft mad children</p>
<p>****: …smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy The music and
voices are all around us Choose, they croon, the ancient ones The time
has come again</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Can I stay with you tonight? We could talk
’till dawn. I just don’t want to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Okay… just talk though. No funny stuff.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Okay. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I’ve been real upset. I lost my car on the
freeway yesterday. I left it somewhere and I can’t remember where and
when I went back it was gone. My sister…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I bet you never expected life could be this
hard. And you’re still so young.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I wonder where we’ll be ten years from now?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I really don’t want to know</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>****: Choose now, they croon Beneath the moon Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest Enter the hot dream Come with us Everything
is broken up and dances</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: These are like beautiful! I never read much
poetry in school. I hated it. What’s a “shaman”?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: He’s the medicine man who starts in a peyote
trance. And he gets everyone in the tribe going and they share in his
vision and it heals them. It’s the same in all cultures – Greeks, Jesus.
Some Indians say the first shaman invented sex. He’s the one who makes
you crazy.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Are you a “shaman”?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh no. I just write about it. What turns you
on?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I don’t know. Experience. Freedom. Love… Now.
Peyote’s like love. When it’s given it’s blessed. When it’s sold it’s
damned. I like peyote. I like acid, it’s easier to get. I like the
spiritual voyage. The first time I did acid I saw God. I did. I had a
friend who was Christ. And he was Judas too. I suddenly knew the secret
of everything – that we’re all one, the universe is one. And that
everything is beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Is it? I don’t know. I think you’re alive by
confronting death – by experiencing pain.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I think you’re alive by recognizing beauty –
seeing truth because when you discover truth you discover what love is…
we’re all saying the same thing. It’s “love me and I’ll love you.”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s only thru death that you know life. Jesus,
medicine men heal people by sacrificing their own life.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Do you love Death?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I think life hurts a lot more than death. When
you die the pain is over.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Why do I look at you… and see my death? No,
that’s ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I bet your dad’s a school teacher.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: How did you know!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: What was your father?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Military</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I bet you moved around a lot.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, about 8 times.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: How many sisters and brothers?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Two.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: One… she’s the pretty one… I love your
neck.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: “…but one, the most beautiful one of all dances
in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with a shrug”</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: That’s beautiful. Who did you write it for?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I wrote it for you.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: …take your time, Jim… there’s no hurry, I’m all
you have to do tonight…</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Well the clock says it’s time to close
now I guess I’d better go now… As we depart the rooftop. Your fingers
weak with minarets Speaking secret alphabets I light another cigarette
Learn to forget, learn to forget, learn to forget</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Om om… No bliss! No bliss!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey Ray, try acid man, it’s guaranteed.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Morrison… Aw shit. Last trip I thought I was
going through hell’s digestive system. Something painted by Hieronymus
Bosch.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I never had a bummer on acid.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I like naturally high man.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Whatever works. Making movies at MGM yet?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Well I saw the head of production and I said
Godard doesn’t use scripts, he improvises with his camera and he said,
“great who’s Godard?”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We gotta take the planet back, reinvent the
Gods, make new myths.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Right on. I thought you went to New York?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Never got there. Went out to the desert and uh…
got lost y’know. Days. I been living on Trick’s rooftop. Got stuck on
this chick…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Whatcha been doing?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Writing. Poems. Songs.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Songs? Lemme hear one.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I can’t sing.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: So neither can Dylan. “Johnny’s in the basement
mixing up the medicine, I’m on the pavement thinking about the
government”. But he’s got the words man. That’s what they want.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let’s swim to the moon un hunh Let’s climb thru
the tide Penetrate the evening That the city sleeps to hide</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let’s swim out tonight love It’s our turn to
try Parked beside the ocean On our moonlight drive</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Wow!… Y’know man those are hot lyrics – really
hot!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …could you write the music for that down, if we
went over to your place, could you write that on your organ?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Are you kidding! I could fly. You wrote that?
You got others?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: A bunch. It’s like I’m taking notes at a rock
concert going on inside my head. I actually hear the music – the spirit
of the wine y’know, intoxication.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Man. You got a voice like Chet Baker – haunted!
What the hell happened to you in the desert? Let’s get a rock and roll
band together man and make a million bucks.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …be great wouldn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s the perfect time man! Two of the guys
outta my band are really into this. I meditate with them. You know them…
Robbie and John. We could have it in the can in three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey why not, I could write the songs with you
guys.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The Stones did it outta the London School of
Economics for Chrissake. Things are about to explode man. You can feel
it in the air. Vietnam’s right out there. Sides are being chosen. People
wanna fight or fuck, love or kill, everything’s gonna flame. The
planet’s screaming for change, Morrison. Make the myths man!!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There oughta be great orgies man. Like when
Dionysus arrived in Greece, he made all the women mad, leaving their
homes and dancing off in the mountains. Great golden copulations in the
streets of LA. Hey, do you know her?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What do we call ourselves. “Dionysus”?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I got a name.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The Doors.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The Doors? That’s the most ridiculous… …you
mean the doors in your mind? Like the Huxley book.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: “The Doors of Perception”? Acid…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah sure mescaline experiments – reducing the
sugar flow to the brain. Great book.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s from William Blake actually, the line –
“when the doors of perception are cleansed – things will appear as they
truly are…”</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: – infinite”. It’s great, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So where do we start? How do we start? Where
are the girls?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Rehearsing. You’re moving off the rooftop and
in with me and Dorothy.</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Let’s swim to the moon Let’s climb thru
the tide Penetrate the evening That the city sleeps to hide…</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: The day destroys the night Night
divides the day Tried to run Tried to hide Break on thru to the other
side</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s really square. Let’s hip it up. Jump on
your cues.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Tighten it up. Stay with the beat Jim. You’re
dragging.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let’s try it again, come on. I’m just getting
into it.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I think it’s hot!!</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I still think the lyrics are weird man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I still think it sounds like the bottom of a
fishbowl man.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Then you write one man! We need more songs
anyway. We all gotta go back and write.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I been working on something goes like this…
A minor. “You know that it would be untrue You know that I would be a
liar If I was to say to you Girl, we couldn’t get much higher” F sharp…
chorus “Come on baby, light my fire Try to set the night on fire…”</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay man there’s some good changes in
there.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Got any more lyrics?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Some. I call it “Light My Fire”. I figger if
I’m gonna compete with your stuff it’s gotta be about earth, fire or
snakes.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Don’t underestimate Death.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah but it sounds like the Byrds man, we’re
not folk rock man. How ’bout trying it with a Latin beat.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I thought we could do the usual verse chorus
verse chorus and</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We don’t need a bridge.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Yeah, we could maybe improvise a couple
piano and guitar solos over it “The time to hesitate is through” Du du
duh dud dada . . .</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: “No time to wallow in the mire Try now we can
only lose And our love become a funeral pyre Come on baby light my
fire”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Pretty good! Pretty neat!!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Nice groove, John. Chaka chaka chaka, then bula
burump bula …you’re right, it could take a coupla long solos, that’s
wild man, like Butterfield did on “East-West” – really hip.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Y’ever heard Coltrane’s “Favorite
Things”?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah – maybe stretch it out and put it in 4/4
on bass, 3/4 on guitar and snare.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Why not! A minor to B minor. Jazz! That then is
jazz! But it needs a hook. Something. Give me some space. I need some
space. Leave the room guys. Come on! Go!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Guy’s obnoxious, man always bossin’ people
around! I thought we were equals!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Aren’t we? That was great Robbie. Whaddaya
thinking about when you play?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Don’t know. Mostly the fish in my fish
tank.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey whadya say we take some of that Tijuana
acid and see what kinda trouble we can get into tonight?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: The chicks always go for you man. I get the
dogs.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Then we’ll start a religion or plan a murder or
go to Tijuana.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whatsamatter with you man, what about Pam, you
got the morals of a coyote.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why you wanna sleep with her John, just to bug
me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hell NO!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …means “hell yes”. She likes you man, she
really does and y’all should. What’s a rock and roll band for man, if
you can’t party all night and do bad things?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sieg Heil!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay here it is. Bach and Rock. Count it off
John</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: 1… 2… 1 - 2 - 3</p>
<p><strong>trip, ciro’s, bido lito’s, gazzarri’s, the experience…
.</strong>: Headlights and neon intercut with:</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: You know that it would be untrue
etc.</p>
<p><strong>jim voice</strong>: The music was new black polished chrome
and came over the summer like liquid night.</p>
<p><strong>girl groupie</strong>: Is that horny motherfucker in the
black pants here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: IDs! IDs! Can’t get in without an</p>
<p><strong>girl 2</strong>: Oh please. I forgot my I.D.. I’m on the
list.</p>
<p><strong>bouncer</strong>: I forgot my list.</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: We chased our pleasures here Dug
our treasures there Can you still recall the time we cried BREAK on
through to the other side</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Turn around Jim! Come on let ’em in.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I found an island in your arms A country in
your eyes Arms that chained us, eyes that lied</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: So Jerry… do we get paid for this?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: What shit, “day destroys the night”, “crawl
back in your brain”, “go insane”. What do people wanna pay money to hear
that shit.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The greater the suffering, the more terrible
the events, the greater the pleasure Jerry. They want it, it’s
catharsis. Like the ancient Greeks.</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: We’re in Los Angeles punk, how would you
know, they like your pants, they’re not listenin’ to you, what the hell
they see in you I…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But they understand Jerry. All our real desires
are unconscious and unseen. . .</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: …you’re the weirdest fuckin’ guy I ever…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You love us?</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: I love ya. You got two more shows to do.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: …I got some real tight record company
connections, just leave it to me man, I’ll take you guys all the fuckin’
way, you blew my mind out there.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah right, but what about the music?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hey the music? I love it man, that’s why
we’re talking right? Some of it’s a little on the dark side though. Ya
know ya oughta get some tunes like Herman’s Hermits stuff – “Mrs. Brown
you got a lovely daughter”. That shit goes right to the radio man.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Uh huh. Well, how ‘bout gettin’ us some real
equipment?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Listen, I sign you guys to a five year
management contract and you got it all. Equipment. Demo. A truck WITH
roadies. Three, maybe four percent record deal. Wherever ya want to go
babe, trust me, I’ll get you there. Whatd’ya say?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: We’ll have a band meeting. The four of us do
everything unanimously or we don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: The musketeers. I’m touched. But lemme tell
you something – loyalty don’t pay the bills. Think about it. Call me
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What a sleaze! Man, Jim’s gotta start facing
the crowd if he’s gonna be the front man.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He’s just getting his confidence.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He never does what we rehearsed. What’s the
point of…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: How does it feel?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Great, but…</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: …make sure you get Barb and Sue Anne to come.
And tell them to ask for Jim!</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Jim, how old are you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ah, twenty one…</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Jesus, you’re a gold mine, I’ll make it
quick and to the point and if you repeat it I’ll deny it – drop these
guys, I’ll put you with some real musicians, your voice, your looks,
that’s what’ll sell records, we’ll make a million bucks. A year.
Goodbye. Call me. I’m right. He gives Jim a card and goes. Pam disgusted
with the type, Jim laughs, likes the guy.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I like a man wears his soul on his face.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: “Whiskey’s” next, I can feel it in my
bones.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I still think the lyrics are weird.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Jesus Ray, every girl out there wanted to fuck
me, I could feel it for the first time!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Right on stud. But you better watch out for the
guys.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Guys, I’m serious about the desert, we still
gotta deepen man, we gotta take some peyote – all of us together, we got
one more stage to go…</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I don’t know man, fucks up my playing. I
been playing music for 10 years man and this is the first time in my
whole damned life I ever played it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Are you satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will you get off my case! I’m never doing acid
again. Too many bad trips man.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s not acid John, it’s peyote. It’s a bonding
ceremony. It’s got to be more… more… more…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m into TM man. I promised my guru…</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I want to! I want to! I’m ready. Let’s go to
the desert… do the peyote, the good peyote.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Who’s on now?</p>
<p><strong>girl 1</strong>: “Love”.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah, Arthur Lee’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>girl 1</strong>: They’re the best… better’n the Beatles.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You mean the Marx Brothers of music, we could
blow ’em away.</p>
<p><strong>girl 2</strong>: And who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The Doors… We’re up the street at the Fog.</p>
<p><strong>girl 1</strong>: The Doors. I heard of you. That’s the
dumbest name. I wouldn’t go to the Fog if you paid me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh yeah what would you do for money?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Let’s go Jim, come on.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So you don’t have a phone number? What do you
mean you don’t have a phone number?</p>
<p><strong>girl 2</strong>: I don’t have a phone number. So give me your
number then.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t have a phone.</p>
<p><strong>girl 1</strong>: Well, would you leave my name at the
door?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well I don’t know. What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>girl 1</strong>: Caprice.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Caprice? That’s the dumbest name I ever
heard.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey! I am the Lizard king. I can do Anything!
Raise your hands if you understand! Alive, any of you alive – let’s take
a poll – how many of you know you’re really alive!!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No one? Raise your hands c’mon man… let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Everybody having a good time?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …awright, pretty good, it gets better.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: WOA!! It’s fast.</p>
<p><strong>jump cuts</strong>: Jim and Pam are touching each other.
Face. Shadows. Sand falls from Pam’s hand. Jim turns to hawk at a bird.
“Hawk! Hawk!” Then Pam is dancing alone on the dune.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: When the serpent appears, his head is ten feet
long and five feet wide. He has one red eye and one green eye. He’s
deadly and he’s seven miles long. As he moves – on his scales is written
all the history of the world, all people, all actions, all of us our
little pictures on the scales, God it’s big! – and it’s eating as it
moves all the time, devouring, digesting consciousness, power, a monster
of energy!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We must kiss the snake on the tongue, if it
senses our fear, it will eat us instantly. But if we kiss it without
fear, the snake will take us through the garden and out the gate. To our
freedom -we must ride this snake. To the end of time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think I’m fucked up. I’m not thinking
right.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’re fucked up John. Go with it, confusion is
the sound of creation.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You should see your eyes right now, you’re
death. Look at your eyes – you’re crazy man, you look crazy. You scare
me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No no no John John. God is crazy too. God is
part insane as well as sane. Not in control all the time. Dionysus was
the God of the wine. He made ecstasy but he also made madness. Madness
is all right. That’s what you want, isn’t it, isn’t it? Where’s that
joint?</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I get scared thinking of all the choices
inside. I could go. I could stay. I can live anywhere. I could die now
if I wanted. It’s limitless choice… and no one cares.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Die Robbie.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What the fuck!</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I don’t know what I am. I’m on the cusp of
Sagittarius and Capricorn. Sagittarius is wild and Capricorn domestic
and safe, so I don’t know which one to be.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh my God, the light, it’s so beautiful
Ray. Can you see it… it’s all one… honey?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’m in pain man. I want something from the
peyote. I feel the universe functioning perfectly but I’m still
perfectly locked inside myself. Instead of Oneness, I feel total
Isolation. Aloneness. Fear… Pain… Jim, all I feel is pain.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Pain makes me feel more alive Ray. Pain is
meant to wake us up. People try to hide their pain but they’re
wrong.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I feel Lust. I want to fuck everything I can,
and I know it will never be enough.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Pam wants you. You’re a good Catholic John, you
want it so you can feel guilty about it… Fuck death away John.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I feel Fear… so bad I just numb out all my
feelings. I’m afraid of my father, I’m afraid of Yahweh… I wish I could
play my guitar.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Maybe you should kill your father Robbie. He
tried to kill you. Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: I’m so fucking scared.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: But you’re Alive! It’s beautiful! Fear, pain,
lust, we’ve got to know all our feelings before we can come out the
other side free men. Don’t feel ashamed of yourselves, don’t let society
destroy your reality. Our freedom’s the only thing worth dying for, it’s
the only thing worth living for!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m not gonna make it man. I’m scared Jim, I’m
still scared. Blindness is coming on.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Then use us John, use our strength, it’s us
four now, a tribe of warriors, everything we have comes from the same
source, the great Creator of Being. Trust him, trust us. Ride the snake.
. . I promise you I will be with you till the end of time.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: My wild love went riding… mmmmmm. She rode all
the day. She ride to the devil. And ask for him to pay… shooo shoooo</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …she went to the desert she went to the sea
Joseph we did see…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …I’m lying to you. I am scared.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Jim, where are you going.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ll be back. I gotta go alone.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Jim! Jim… come here, dance… don’t go away.</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Can you picture what will be So
limitless and free Desperately in need of some stranger’s hand in a
desperate land Lost in a Roman wilderness of pain and all the children
are insane: waiting for the summer rain</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: There’s danger on the edge of town Ride
the King’s highway Weird scenes inside the gold mine Ride the King’s
highway west, baby</p>
<p><strong>indian ghost voice</strong>: …you are a prince among white
men, yet you are a warrior among us. You are ready now. Go out “walk
with the pain of the world, travel to the end of the wind” – and change
it for all men as you were born to do.</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Ride the snake Ride the snake, to the
lake The ancient lake The snake is long, seven miles Ride the snake He’s
old, and his skin is cold</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: The west is best Get here and we’ll
do the rest The blue bus is calling us Driver where you taking us?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The killer awoke before dawn He put his boots
on He took a face from the ancient gallery And he walked on down the
hall</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: He went to the room where his sister lived And
he paid a visit to his brother And then he went on down the hall…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And he came to a door, And he looked inside
“Father?” “Yes, son?” “I want to kill you”.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mother… I want to…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on baby take a chance with us</p>
<p>****: And meet me in the back of the blue bus Doona blue rog onna
blue bus Doona blue yeah! Come on yeah!</p>
<p><strong>nobody’s gonna fuck their mother on</strong>: MY STAGE!
YOU’RE OUTTA HERE. You don’t ever come back to play, you don’t ever come
back to drink – You’re DEAD ON THE STRIP!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Kill the father, fuck the mother, kill the
father, fuck the mother – that’s what I’m into! That’s what I’m
into!</p>
<p><strong>jerry</strong>: You – MORRISON! You’re fucking filthy twisted
perverse punk, get back to your fucking sewer!!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You have the face of a pig man.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: JERRY JERRY… He was talking about Oedipus!
GREEK TRAGEDY!! It’s ART!!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on Jerry, cool it, cool it… he’s a kid,
it’s a song about dying, changing…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ll never work again man. The Mafia controls
all these clubs.</p>
<p><strong>holzman</strong>: Quite a night! Hi, I’m Jac Holzman. I own
Elektra Records.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Oh sure, hi.</p>
<p><strong>holzman</strong>: Listen… I think if you could just put what
you did in there on record, we could really have something… and we could
make a lot of money…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>holzman</strong>: Yeah… and Rothchild here was born to be
your producer.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Hey, the guy that did Butterfield!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Bertold Brecht, cabaret and rock. Give me a
fucking break. You guys are amazing! Let’s go make a record.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey, is that asshole gonna pay us?</p>
<p><strong>holzman</strong>: Why don’t you go inside and ask him
Jim?</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: You know that it would be untrue You
know that I would be a liar If I was to say to you Girl, we couldn’t get
much higher</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Hey Bruce, you feel it?</p>
<p><strong>bruce</strong>: I’m having big fun.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I got goosebumps Jac. This is history going
down here. An album of killer music in six days… six days… unreal!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on baby, LIGHT MY FIIIRRRREEEE!!!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Pretty good! Pretty neat!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The time to hesitate is through No time to
wallow in the mire.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Try now we can only lose And our love become a
funeral pyre Come on baby, light my fire Try to set the night on</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Oh show me the way to the next whisky
bar Oh don’t ask why Oh don’t ask why</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t mind dying in a plane crash, a smile on
my face.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: As compared to what?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I just don’t want to go out slow – brain tumor,
botulism. I want to feel what it’s like, cause death is only going to
happen to you once.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I don’t want to die ever, what a weird thing
to say.</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: For if we don’t find the next whisky bar
I tell you we must die I tell you I tell you I tell you we must die</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Oh moon of Alabama We now must say
goodbye We’ve lost our good ol mama We must have whiskey oh you know
why</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Show me the way to the next little girl
Oh don’t ask why Oh don’t ask why</p>
<p><strong>girls</strong>: Oh Jimmmmm, pleeeaaase look, I looove

picture Jim?… Jim, Jim, oh please look at me Jim!!</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: For if we don’t find the next little
girl I tell you we must die I tell you I tell you I tell you we must
die</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Right this way Mr. Sullivan. They’re
called “the Doors”. They got the number one single in the country –
“Light Your Fire”.</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: “Light Your Fire”? Is that sooo?</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: They look pretty grungy but we’re…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re gonna cut it!</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: No, I’m going to worship it. What kind
of shampoo are you using?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The kind you get in hotels.</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: Pamper yourself sweetheart, you don’t
want split ends, you’re a celebrity now. You have very serious-serious
hair, it needs to rebel. I’ll give it a tinge of something freaky.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I’d rather stay the same color.</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: Scaredy cat.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: Honey, we don’t have enough time.</p>
<p><strong>tv newsman</strong>: …here in Detroit, 42 people dead, more
than 2000 injured… 1400 buildings burned, 5000 people have just lost
their homes as Detroit joins more than 100 cities torn by riots this hot
summer!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No wonder “Light My Fire’s” number one.</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: What about you handsome?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The biggest mistakes in my life have been
haircuts.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Don’t wash it. Don’t set it. He likes it the
way it is…</p>
<p><strong>hairdresser</strong>: All right, be mean…</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Boys – meet Mr. Sullivan</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Hi boys, heard your song “Light That Fire”
…think you’re great… good luck out there.</p>
<p><strong>doors</strong>: Oh thanks Mr. Sullivan.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Well the guys at Network have told us they
have a small problem with the lyrics “girl we couldn’t get much higher”.
You can’t say “higher” on network so they asked if… you could say, “girl
we can’t get much better”… can you dig that?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How ’bout, “girl you couldn’t bite my
wire”.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: I don’t think Standards and Practices
would…</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Look, you boys don’t forget to smile now.
Don’t be so sullen out there…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh well, we’re kind of a sullen group, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: We’ll work it out Herb, promise. Give me
five.</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Groovy! Uh you boys should know
Mr. Sullivan is considering you boys for four more shows. You dig?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What – are we the Beatles now John?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s only a word man. The Stones changed…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey Ray, why don’t you change your name to Sid
or Irving Manzarek or something… it’s only a word y’know.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: It’s my words. I don’t care, let’s just
jam.</p>
<p><strong>sullivan</strong>: Now here on our stage direct from Los
Angeles, California, ladies and gentlemen, The Doors!</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: What’s that?… oh Jesus!… get off it!!
Where’s he going?</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: You know that it would be untrue
You know that I would be a liar If I was to say to you Girl, we couldn’t
get much higher Come on baby light my fire</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: He said it! He said it! On National TV You
can’t do that! You can’t do that!!! You blew it you little shit! You’ll
never play Ed Sullivan again.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on baby, light my fire Try to set the
night on FIIIIRRRRRE!</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: What can I do, what do you want me to do?…
Jim?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t know… I guess I should see a doctor or
something… maybe I should go to someone of the straight Jungian
philosophy.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: It happens to other guys too…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s so scary up there. To be adored. Isn’t
that irony? Teenage death girls want my dick – a mere clown – not my
words. I’ll never wake up in a good mood again… Lament for my cock, a
tongue of knowledge deep in the feathered night, gives life, soar and
crucify, I seek to know you…</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: It’s not so complicated Jim, it’s just sex,
y’know.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You should marry an insurance salesman.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: It’s the hours man, the pressure, everything’s
like your last performance, you’re setting yourself up.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We weren’t built to last.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Aren’t you doing this for you, because you’re a
poet, not a rock star. Ed Sullivan’s not a place for you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You really know what I am Pam? You know what
poetry is? Where is the feast they promised us? Where is the wine – the
new wine – dying on the vine?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: What are you saying!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Y’see – I lied to you. I really love Fame.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Why are you doing this to me?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: ’Cause you’re in the room.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: And this is gonna help! It’s probably the
cause. ’Least put some soul in your success asshole!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Maybe you’re the cause!</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I mean I don’t have this problem with anybody
else.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Give it to me!!!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No!!!!! Mommy!!!</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Fuck you man I’m outta here.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Get mad! Yeahhh! Love my girl! Yeah, go fuck
the other guys. How many white guys have you fucked Pam? 10, 20? Black
guys what? You like Chinese dicks? Mongolian penis? 30?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: …how many dogs have you fucked! You don’t say
No to anybody! Drugs, dogs, uglies, you’d fuck a doorknob with butter on
it!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: How could I do that</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: You’re the first one who couldn’t make it with
me anyway! You’re the only limp dick in the lot!!!</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Wild Child full of grace Savior of the
human race Your cool face Natural child, terrible child Not your mother
or your father’s child Your own child, screaming wild</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You were saying?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …will you die for me, Pam, a clown, a
despicable clown?… a mere despicable clown?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Yes yes yes.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …I need a home. A place to hide.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: …with me. Yes… yes…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …how could we make a home?… where there’s
sanctuary?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: …yes, yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …we’re in Africa, we’re just animals… I wanna
stay inside you all night baby… let’s fuck death away, now fuck death
away…</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: …yes…</p>
<p><strong>journalist 1</strong>: What are your songs about
Mr. Morrison?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh love death travel… revolt. We all write the
songs, we’re interested in anything about disorder, chaos, especially
activity which seems to have no meaning… I think when you make peace
with authority, you become authority.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 1</strong>: Can you define that a little more?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah you can call us erotic politicians I
guess.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 2</strong>: Do you really consider yourself a
shaman Mr. Morrison?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …a scapegoat maybe – I take on the audiences’
fantasies, obeying their impulses. When the impulses are destructive,
I’m destructive. It’s kinda like sucking the puss out of a rattlesnake,
something like that.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 1</strong>: …like a medicine man or witch
doctor?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Jim said to me once, the history of rock and
roll’s like Greek drama or caveman stories. The audience comes to see
ancient rituals in ancient caves. Their souls in jeopardy. They’re not
watching any longer, they’re participating – and everything’s in play,
your life, your death…</p>
<p><strong>journalist 1</strong>: Is that why they scream so much?</p>
<p><strong>journalist 3</strong>: Mr. Morrison, how do you feel about
being called the “ultimate barbie doll”.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I guess when you say something like that, it’s
a shortcut to thinking.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 3</strong>: Then do you “think” about the dreadful
reviews your new poetry book has gotten?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I guess they didn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 3</strong>: And it’s true you financed it’s
publication?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Have you bothered to read the poetry ma’m? You
keep denying that anything good can come from L.A., I mean isn’t that
kind of a provincial attitude? That Bob Dylan’s the only poet cause he’s
from the East Coast, but you won’t even look past Jim’s goddamn looks at
the words man!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey c’mon Ray, hate should be allowed.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 1</strong>: …but what really are your songs about
Mr. Morrison? You preach, “saving the planet”, “making a new age” but
how does drinking, taking drugs, this boozy sort of apocalyptic stance
at the world influence young people in a positive way?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I like that – “boozy apocalyptic” – you’re a
word man, but how does your newspaper influence young people to think
about Vietnam? Who’s sending the soldiers over there to die? The
establishment – right? Your newspaper – right? That seems to me a lot
more dangerous than the stuff we do.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 3</strong>: Do you believe in drugs
Mr. Morrison?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Did you know Nietzsche said, “all good
consciousness, all evidence of truth comes only from the senses”? Hey
you wanna arm wrestle? Come on, you look pretty tough today. C’mon, I’ll
take you all on.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 3</strong>: And alcohol? Is that considered part
of the shaman’s wisdom?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Part of the clown’s wisdom – it’s kinda the
American way. You know we spend more on alcohol and tobacco than on
education.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 3</strong>: Are you by any chance in a trance now
Mr. Morrison?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Do you hurt?</p>
<p><strong>journalist 3</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What hurts you the most?</p>
<p><strong>journalist 3</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh… got tired of the barbie doll look. It
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 3</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: About? Y’know when people are joking, I find
they are dead serious and when they’re dead serious, I find them
funny.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 4</strong>: What do your parents think about what
you are doing?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Actually, I don’t really remember being born.
It musta happened during one of my blackouts.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 4</strong>: But they must’ve expressed some
feeling?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, to be honest they’re not living anymore
so I don’t like to talk about that.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 4</strong>: Could you at least tell us how they
died?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh, it was a… horrible car crash… in the desert
in the fifties, Arizona… ran right into a truckload of Indians… Navajos,
they were lying out on the road, all bleeding, and I was with my Grandma
and Grandad, we were banged up and all… and I was looking at my Dad and
he was lying there… but his throat was severed and there was air coming
out.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 4</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>journalist 2</strong>: I have the feeling I’m being put
on.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Y’all believe what you want to believe, you
will anyway… but it does kinda show you what excites people? Fear, pity,
horror – all those good things that count. It’s sorta I guess like being
on the edge of an orgasm, y’know… that mystery just before you come.
When? If? Should I? Will you die for me, eat me, this way, the end…</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You want to do some more cocaine? It’ll
loosen you up.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Great! A new thing.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wow how old is this?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: 14th Century. I practice the Craft.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The Craft?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: I’m a witch A white one.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wow! You Patricia? Who would’ve guessed?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: The Kennealy’s were Celtic cheiftains and
pre-Christian shamans when your Druid ancestors the Morrisons were a
minor Scottish clan founded by a bastard son of the king of Norway.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: It’s a religion, witchcraft. Witches are
the protectors of the seasons, the harvests, goddesses of the grain. And
when crossed, destroyers.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You ever try drinking blood?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: It works you know. You drink blood the
right time of the moon… they used to dance in the forests naked. I think
that’s what offended the Puritans and led to the Burnings. They were a
sexual threat to their male order like the Bacchae – five days a year
for Dionysus, they used to wander the hills in ancient Greece, the first
witches, clans of wild women fucking, looting, eating animals raw, the
wine in their blood running hot – looking for Dionysus… to tear him to
pieces – isn’t that wild?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where do you get the blood?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Blood is the rose of mysterious union,
symbol of potency… now you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No… I don’t like… cutting myself.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Don’t be such a child! If I do it, you
have to do it.</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Before you slip into unconsciousness I’d
like to have another kiss Another flashing chance at bliss Another kiss,
another kiss</p>
<p><strong>jump cut</strong>: He is chasing her with one of her goat
horns between his legs. They wrestle, yell, lusty bacchanale.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Come on rock god, fuck me, fuck me
good.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m gonna burn you down.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Come on…</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Cut me! Cut me go on!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nobody’d ever look at you again – ’cept me. I’d
scar you forever.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Yeah YEAH!</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: The crystal ship is being filled A
thousand girls, a thousand thrills A million ways to spend your time
When we get back I’ll drop a line</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Take off your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mooooooo!!!</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: You remind me of a Russian peasant. I see
you standing in a wheat field. The pride, the arrogance. You love to
look at yourself don’t you. You love yourself. …good… big cat
stalking…</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: …the camera is like a roulette wheel Jim. It
becomes whoever you want it to be – a woman you want to seduce, a man
you want to kill, a mother you want to upset, a wife you want to lie to
or love, whatever you want it to be, it is…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Where are the Doors.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Forget the Doors. It’s you they want, Jim.
You’re the Doors.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We do everything together.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: You control the audience, like dogs,
manipulate them Jim, one picture can control a million people, be
anything you want – growl at them, be ugly, be frightened, be selfish.
Be man, woman, whild, animal. Live, die, return again. Anything you
want. Everything is permitted.</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Go on look at yourself, fall in love with
yourself. You’re your own audience now Jim. They want you. Worship and
love and adore you…</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: …Jim Morrison, the god of Rock and Cock…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I am the snake and you are the lute</p>
<p><strong>gloria</strong>: Exactly…</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: People are strange when you’re a
stranger Faces look ugly when you’re alone Women seem wicked when you’re
unwanted Streets are uneven when you’re down</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: When you’re strange Faces come out of
the rain When you’re strange No one remembers your name When you’re
strange When you’re strange When you’re strange</p>
<p><strong>pr man</strong>: You must meet Andy Warhol, Jim. He’s more
than an artist. Andy is art. Bright people in America wonder – does Andy
imitate life, or does life imitate Andy. The meeting of two kings. Yes,
Come.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Oh Jim this is Tom… Baker, he’s an actor, he
was in Andy’s movie and this is Count Ruspoli. He lives in Paris, but
he’s Italian. He’s from a very famous family over there. They’re seven
hundred years old.</p>
<p><strong>count</strong>: Hi Jim, you are great… I see you at Ondine’s
with Bobby and Jimmy. It…</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Don’t you like the way he talks. Isn’t he
cool?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah… hey what’s your trip?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Saw your gig at ‘The Scene’. Hot… very hot… You
strung out? Here. Try this.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Love your movies man. What a great penis…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Come on, we’re splitting man. Dorothy’s waiting
at the door. We’ll get a bite at Max’s and…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You can’t leave. Where’s your will to be weird
man?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Get outta here man. This is fucking weird
man.</p>
<p><strong>pr man</strong>: Right this way Jim. Andy’s in the
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Don’t go, y’see Norman Mailer, I hear he’s
here?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah can we meet him, he’s great… just like he
is. You wanna meet him?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t know… did he know who you were?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Yeah sure, he’s cool, come on, he’s your
hero!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nah… later…</p>
<p><strong>edie</strong>: Hey Jim, this is Jake Johnson, you remember
Jake Johnson – the astronaut, he’s just got back from outer space.</p>
<p><strong>jake johnson</strong>: I like the Doors, I like the Doors, I
like the Doors.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I like outer space.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Hey where’s my joint? There’s this chick sings
with the Velvet Underground, Andy’s band. She says she can drink you
under the table.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: I’m Nico. It’s boring tonight. Some of us are
going downtown to a new club. You want to come?</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: …elevate your taste in trolls man.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Vodka? Race you.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Your death…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wanna go?… Come on let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: She looks too freaky to me.</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Wait just a minute.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on there’s pussy Robbie.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Hey I met this chick Lynne, she wants to be
alone.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Come on Jim, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Don’t you guys wanna meet Andy Warhol?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tell you the truth, I can live without him.
He’s a freak. Let’s get outta here. We got a show tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on man! I thought we were gonna be a band,
the four of us – and party all night, rock and roll!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I could never keep up with you Jim. I couldn’t
make the music.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Don’t go. Don’t leave! You can’t leave. I don’t
know what will happen. It might be Death.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Come on Jim, this isn’t our scene, these people
are vampires. We gotta stick together man, the four of us. Let’s make
the myths man.</p>
<p><strong>pr man</strong>: Right here Jim, right here. Andy’s waiting.
You know what you have in common is uniqueness.</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Strange days have found us Strange days
have tracked us down They’re going to destroy Our casual joys We shall
go on playing or find a new town</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nico!</p>
<p><strong>warhol</strong>: Well, it was such a big opening, we just had
to go to Philadelphia, y’know, you were supposed to, mmm…</p>
<p><strong>pr guy</strong>: Andy! Andy!</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: …but so many people showed up, the paintings
were getting crushed, so they took them all down… um, it really looked
great y’know… maybe uhhh…</p>
<p><strong>pr man</strong>: …the walls. The blank walls. Andy was the
art. Should do a show. Just walls. Today it’s really about people, not
what they do. It’s the astronaut that matters, not the voyage, the
actor, not the movie – how do I say, it’s the trip, not arriving.</p>
<p><strong>pr man</strong>: …you know what Andy says, some day
everybody’s gonna be famous for 15 seconds, but it won’t mean
anything.</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: That’s too short. I need a coupla hours.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: We’d just love to have you in our movies Jim,
you’re so beautiful, you’d be so good, you mmmm, here… this is for you
Jim.</p>
<p><strong>andy</strong>: Edie gave this to me and said mmmmm, I could
talk to God with this. But I don’t really have anything to say. So… mmmm
now you can talk to God. Oh hi!</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Strange days have found us And through
their strange hours We linger alone</p>
<p><strong>nico</strong>: Morrison!</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Bodies confused Memories misused As we
run from the day To a strange night of stone</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Strange days have found us Strange days

<p><strong>techie</strong>: Testing one-two-three. Testing.</p>
<p><strong>promoter</strong>: Look, the Fire Marshall’s not gonna let
the show go on. Either you go back to your seats, you go to the aisle,
you don’t do that – no show!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: “Lord Byron”? Really. You think? You like the
poems?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Like? I loved them! “Mad bad and dangerous
to know.” That’s what they said about him. Your poems should be taken as
seriously.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: These are the kindest words I’ve ever heard in
my life. No one has ever understood. Thank you. Maybe I should always
fuck my critics.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Y’know I don’t even like rockers. They’re
sleazy. I made up my fuck list the other night – out of 30 guys there
were maybe three of them, y’know. I’m not a groupie.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let’s do it, here, now… with the sound of the
crowd. Like Nuremberg, wild German fucking.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You like that hunh? Beg!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m begging! I’m begging you!</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You wanna fuck me, Morrison, don’t ever
lie to me again. Ever!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: About what!</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Your father. Why do you tell me bullshit
like your father’s dead?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What’s your problem with fathers! They’re dead,
both of them, I told you.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: If he’s so dead, then who answered the
phone when I called the house?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You didn’t really think you’d get away
with that, Morrison. An Admiral in the United States Navy. Who’s at the
Gulf of Tonkin when Vietnam starts. Your Dad’s a Deputy Chief of
Operations.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What’d he say? That was really stupid. Why
didn’t you just ask me.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Well naturally he wasn’t too happy when I
called. Your Mom wanted to talk but he shut her off.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’re a fuckin’ cunt. You could ruin his
career if…</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: What, I’m a “fuckin’ cunt” because I
called the house? Like it’s hard to trace your school records.
University of Florida, Albuquerque, New Mexico, Arlington, Virginia,
Washington, D.C. Brother, sister, it’s seven miles long baby – it’s all
in the “The End”, it’s so easy.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Don’t ever try to hide anything from me
again. Okay? Go on… tell me. Did he make you cut your hair? Did he hit
you, was he a bully? Did he love you? How much?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: And your mother?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t want to talk about it. Hate is a very
underestimated emotion.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: It doesn’t matter anymore does it. Listen
to them. It’s you they want now. Not the Doors, not your mother or your
father’s child… They want you Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’re wrong. What they want I can’t give… my
death – ripped to pieces – do you feel their power?</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You have no choice, Jim. I see you up
there like Icarus. I see you flying closer and closer to the sun. And
your wings are melting…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I want to live, Patricia. I don’t wanna
die.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Patricia… Patricia…</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Whatcha doing there?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh… nuthin’</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Okay, outta there both of you. No one’s allowed
backstage. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You idiot, don’t you know who…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey, I’m with the band man. It’s cool. Take it
easy.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Let’s go. NOW! You’re both under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey, eat it man!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Mace! Shit!</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Help! They got Jim!!!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why’d you blind me man? You blinded me!</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: What the hell happened! Don’t touch Jim.
Get some water. Don’t touch your eyes.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Hey all he said was…</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: He was WHAT! He’s Jim Morrison for
chrissake. Jim, Jim – you okay – let’s get you under the water here.
Don’t touch, you’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: I’m going to have to issue a warrant for his
arrest.</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: Are you NUTS!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Why don’t you leave him alone lady, he doesn’t
need more shit in his life.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: What do you know what Jim needs?</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: …Hup two – three – four…</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: Present arms!…</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: Make a grave for the unknown
soldier Nestled in your hollow shoulder The unknown soldier Practice as
the news is read Television children dead Bullet strikes the helmet’s
head It’s all over The war is over!</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: Well the men don’t know But the
little girls unnerstan’…</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: When all the good people are trying
to sleep I’m out there making my midnight creep Yeah, cause I’m a
backdoor man The men don’t know But the little girls unnerstan’…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I wanna tell you ’bout something that happened
just a few minutes ago right here in New Haven. This is New Haven isn’t
it? New Haven, Connecticut, United States of America?</p>
<p><strong>heckler</strong>: HEY MORRISON, is the West really the best
or are you just stoned on weeeeeedddddd??????</p>
<p><strong>voice’s</strong>: “Light My Fire”. Sing “Light My Fire”.
Yeah. Give us Light My Fire!… We want Mick Jagger! Take your clothes off
Jim. Show it to us! We want the Lizard King!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well I was with this girl backstage, y’know. We
got to talking and we wanted some privacy, so we went into this shower
stall. We weren’t doin’ anything y’know jes’ standing there and
talking.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …and then this little man came in there, this
little man in a little blue suit and a little blue cap…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And he said – “Whatcha doin’ there?” I said,
“nuthin’” and he said, “Well you better get outta there or…” “Or what” I
asked him…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And he started pushing me and I pushed back and
he didn’t like that so he reached back there and got out his little can
of mace. And sprayed it right in my eyes. And blinded me. Why? Cause I
was alone in a room with a lady doing what he would like to be doing if
he could ever get it up without a gun.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: In the United States of America. Land of the
free. Home of the Brave man – in God We Trust right? TURN</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Say your thing man!</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Young man you’ve gone too far. The
show’s over. You’re under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They’re gonna beat the shit out of him
man!</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Hey whatcha got here? A boy or a girl?</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: What do you care. You’re gonna fuck him
anyway… Okay rock star, let’s see the backdoor you keep bawling about.
Where’s the roach powder?</p>
<p><strong>cop 1</strong>: Ain’t he the prettiest long-haired boy y’ever
saw?</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Turn around rock star.</p>
<p><strong>cop 2</strong>: Stand clear, who the hell knows what’s living
in there?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You finished? You sure you’re finished? Haven’t
you forgotten something – the consolation prize they gave ya for taking
your cock and balls? The guns. Why don’t you use em you withered dicks!
You shit- eating red-neck chickenshit bastards, I hope this makes your
worthless lives…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You better kill me cause I’m gonna come back
and fuck everyone of your daughters…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: He could go all the way man! In five years he
could be in the White House. Another JFK.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I drink so I can talk to assholes. This
includes me. Let’s just say I was testing the bounds of reality –
that’s-all – I was curious… I kinda always preferred to be hated. Like
Erich Von Stroheim in the movies… the man you loved to hate… it’s meant
to be ironic, courage wants to laugh. Y’know it’s essentially a stupid
situation. I go out on a stage and I howl for people. In me they see
what they want to see – some say the Lizard King, whatever that means,
or some black-clad leather demon whatever that means… but really I think
of myself as a sensitive, intelligent human being but with the soul of a
clown which always forces me to blow it at the most crucial moment… a
fake hero… a joke the gods played on me… it’s okay, I accept the joke…
and smile. Death old friend, death and my cock, I can forgive my
injuries in the name of wisdom, luxury, romance. Words got me the wound
and will get me well. All join now in lament of my cock, a tongue of
knowledge in the feathered night. Boys get crazy in the head and suffer.
I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Hey Jim, how ’bout hitting a strip- joint?
It’s getting late and we can…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nah, later…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Now listen to this I’ll tell you about Texas
Radio and the big beat soft driven slow and mad like some new language
reaching your head with the cold sudden fury of a divine messenger let
me tell you about heartache and the loss of God wandering, wandering in
hopeless night out here on the perimeter there are no stars out here we
is stoned, immaculate… but I tell you this: No eternal reward will
forgive us now for wasting the dawn.</p>

burned gold into our hair At night we swam the laughing sea When
summer’s gone where will we be</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: It’s only another $95,000 but I could get the
best clothes. From India, Morocco Jim, clothes you can’t find anywhere,
we could get the richest people to come, Miles Davis, Cher, the Stones,
it’s gonna be the best boutique on La Cienega Jim… why are we walking,
how come we don’t have a car?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …cause you lost it. It’s fun to walk, isn’t
it.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: …that was months ago. We got another car.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Which car?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: The red one with the black interior. Remember
it was a shift and I didn’t like it. What happened to it?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh yeah… I wrecked it.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Oh Jim! Damn! Where’s the Gravy Train?
Whatsamatter? What are you on? You promised you wouldn’t drink
today.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No Ma I ain’t drinking.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: You’re not gonna drink any more are you
Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: No Ma I ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: And you’re gonna change those stinky leathers
you been wearing for three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I don’t know ’bout that.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: What the hell are you on?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Uh – just some low grade acid. It’s not heavy.
Pam, read my mind.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Jesus Jim! Goddamit! You PROMISED. I made the
duck! People are coming! Ray and Dorothy think we’re flaky enough and I…
you said you’d wait till after, you’re going to peak before me.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey it’s okay, it’s okay… come on, we’ll trip
and then eat our feast.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Yeah sure.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on baby, y’know it’s a good thing for Ray
and Dorothy I think women are such noble creatures – they carry on your
name with dignity after you die.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: What are you saying? You wanna marry me
Jim?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I think women basically have a comic approach
to life – I mean how can they not when they look up in the dark and see
a dangling penis, seeking entry. It looks like a face y’know – little
beard “Hi mom” I wanna get inside you. Look around. “Do the funky
chicken, do dah, dah, funky chicken do da da”love my girl” –</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let’s go wild child, let’s get out there Romeo
and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam, rock and
roll …all the poetry has wolves in it, but one Pam – the most beautiful
one of all – dances in a ring of fire and throws off the challenge with
a shrug</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I like it when you sing to me</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: ’cause I’m the poet and you’re my muse</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: What am I going to do about these papers! Jim,
Jim – you really need someone to organize this stuff. Your handwriting’s
just like a little kid.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: My God look at this. I wonder if William Blake
was ever this disorganized.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Oh the duck!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Get some drinks, man. Over there Pam!</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I’m gonna be your editor now, seriously I’m
going to organize all your stuff. I’m gonna take out all the fuck
words.</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: You’re lost little girl You’re lost
little girl You’re lost, tell me Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let’s go wild child, let’s get out there Romeo
and Juliet, Marilyn Monroe and Vincent Van Gogh, Jim and Pam, rock and
roll “Clothed in sunlight Restless in wanting Dying of fever Changed
shapes of an empire Vast promissory notes of joy How it has changed you
How slowly estranged you Solely arranged you Beg you for mercy”</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Pam… Honey, you’re trying too hard.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I’m not – I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes you are.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: There’s some great poetry here Jim, some
wonderful ideas.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yeah but nobody wants to read poetry anymore,
nobody cares, it’s not like important y’know. Just put it away. Not
right now.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: But what am I supposed to do? How do I fit in?
Who am I supposed to be around all these people?</p>
<p><strong>count</strong>: Darling Pamela, I brought you a little
something.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You’re my girl, that’s who…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I’m not your girl, don’t give me that shit.
I know you fuck everything that touches you.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hi Jim…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: All right so I do. I live my life the way I
want. I don’t want anyone expecting anything from me – including you!
You don’t like it then get the fuck out! Oh hi Anne. You know Pam? She’s
a little pissed off right now but…</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Okay Jim let’s eat that duck.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Come on Pam, let’s put out the plates…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Anne O’Riordan. Are you Anne O’Riordan?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You must be Pamela</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: down through her</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well I… sometimes yeah</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I understand… I really do but don’t ever
think that Jim’s gonna love you or take care of you. You’re one of a
hundred you know</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey – don’t you know when to stop!</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Look who’s talking</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’d like to think Jim can make up his own mind
who he loves and who he doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Don’t kid yourself sweetheart, Jim’s crazy
but he’s not that crazy. He loves me.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Jesus, it’s not gonna be one of these
dinners is it Jim? How ’bout some turkey?</p>
<p><strong>baker</strong>: Love it!! Far out.</p>
<p><strong>dorothy</strong>: Yes, let’s go into the kitchen. The duck’s
ready.</p>
<p><strong>girlfriend</strong>: Jim, you should meet Chuck Vincent. He
came specially to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh yeah – Chuck. You’re my idol man… since I
was 12. The best man…</p>
<p><strong>chuck vincent</strong>: So you the white boy makin’ all that
money.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I still can’t hold a candle to you.</p>
<p><strong>chuck vincent</strong>: Hey everybody Chuck Vincent’s here.
Yo sho can’t boy, I ain’t heard much of yor stuff. What I done heard
don’t show me much.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: So fuck you man…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Chuck Vincent man! No. He’s right… Chuck
Vincent’s here, everybody, Chuck Vincent.</p>
<p><strong>chuck</strong>: Ain’t no honkey ever gonna sing the blues,

<p><strong>pam</strong>: I just have one thing to say to you –</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s not Thanksgiving honey.</p>
<p><strong>count</strong>: Pamela, bella, please behave hunh… Va fanculo

<p><strong>patricia</strong>: See you later.</p>

hell is happening to us. There’s some great poetry…</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: You’re lost little girl You’re lost,
tell me Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ladies and Gentlemen, from Los Angeles
California – The DOORS!</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: Jim! Your Mom’s here with your brother.
What do you want me to do with ’em?</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: There’s been a slaughter here Don’t
stop to speak or look around Your gloves and fan are on the ground We’re
getting out of town we’re going on the run And you’re the one I want to
come Not to touch the earth Not to see the sun Nothing left to do But
run, run, run Let’s run, let’s run…</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: Vice Squad says one more “fuck or shit”
they’re gonna close us down man.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Stick my dick in their ear!</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: House upon the hill Moon is lying
still…</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: Shadows of the trees witnessing the
wild breeze Come on baby run with me Run with me, let’s run…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh hi… I didn’t realize you were
entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>count</strong>: Scusi Jimmy, I hope you’re cool about
this…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Don’t forget your smack on the way out.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The mansion is warm at the top of the hill Rich
are the rooms and the comforts there Red are the arms of luxuriant
chairs You won’t know a thing till you get inside</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I told you about that shit. Or are we talking
about death choices here?</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I’m just doing my thing, just like you said,
it’s my thing, why can’t I have a thing. Ow! You’re hurting me!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Get up. Hurt? You want to know HURT? Let me
introduce you to my good friend hurt.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Ah sanctuary!… a soft place to hide.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: …from you, you pig!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ll give you a place to hide forever!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: This is the best part of the trip, honey…</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; the doors</strong>: Dead President’s corpse in the
driver’s car The engine runs on glue and tar C’mon along, we’re not
going very far To the East to meet the Czar…</p>
<p><strong>high priestess</strong>: …we worship the ancient forces of
Nature, the Triple Goddess, the Great Mother and the Lord, the Horned
One… when the vow is taken</p>
<p><strong>high priestess</strong>: …it is a blending of souls on a
karmi and cosmic plane that affects your future incarnations on this
planet. Death does not part – only lack of love – and the vow is forever
in the Goddess’ sight.</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: Run with me, run with me Run with
me, let’s run Some outlaws live by the side of a lake The minister’s
daughter’s in love with a snake</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: Who lives in a well by the side of

<p><strong>kim</strong>: It was all right</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Hey it’s no big deal. I like to cry when I

mama gets home.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: She is home Jim</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: It’s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You know you’ve always been good to me in bed
Judy. And it was nice of you to bring your friend. I want to keep seeing
both of you but it can’t be all the time y’know. It would be a night
every few weeks or so. That’s just the way I am, I’m not dependable. I
can’t be a boyfriend. Would you do that? I mean could you handle it?
That way? I don’t want you to get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: I already been hurt enuf’ by you Jim, I don’t
have much to lose do I?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>judy</strong>: …yes</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: …Well, just think about it awhile. Call me when
you get your new number… Hey that’s a really nice outfit you’re wearing,
you really have good taste in clothes. How long have you two been
friends?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come back later! Who is it!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s a secret.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Whyn’t you come back later. I don’t have any
clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Jim, I gotta talk! Let me in please. I gotta
talk.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Now Pam sweetheart, I’m busy.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Jim, I know there’s someone in there, I can’t
believe you’re doing this again. You’re disgusting.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well you see Pam there’s this crazy girl in
here, she’s just lying on the bed with her legs open and I don’t know
what to do.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: FUCK YOU!!! I want to see her.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s your cousin Lizzie, you don’t want to see
her. Go home.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: We’re all sisters, let me see her. Jim,… I got
this wonderful leg of lamb in the oven for supper… and the house is
immaculate. Sage is waiting. He wants you to play with him… are you
coming…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Jim goddamit answer me!!</p>
<p><strong>doors song</strong>: C’mon, c’mon, c’mon c’mon now Touch me
babe Can’t you see that I am not afraid</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What was that promise you made Why don’t you
tell me what she said What was that promise that she made I’m gonna love
you Till the heaven stops the rain I’m gonna love you Till the stars
fall from the sky For you and I…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: …fuckin’ neanderthal primadonna is too drunk
to see. Cut it… that was beautiful sweetheat, we had a technical
problem, we’ll take it again from the top babe whenever you’re
ready.</p>
<p><strong>densmore</strong>: What’s his fucking problem?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Paul babe.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Right here baby.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why don’t you suck a fart out of my asshole you
slave driving facist motherfucker!</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I hear the booze, I hear the smokes Jim, I
don’t hear the voice and babe I didn’t hear the song!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So what are we going to tonight Paul! 67 takes!
It’s stale!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Alright, let’s try something else.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I wanna sing blues. This stuffs getting too
self-conscious.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: Cause it’s my song man?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Let’s sing “Rock is Dead”! You’re all a buncha
slaves… “Oh come all ye faithful.”</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Shut up Jim! I don’t understand! I don’t. What
are ya doing! I love you like a brother, I do, but why are you fucking
this up. It’s a perfect radio song for chrissake! No one wants to hear
the blues anymore! Think like a singer, you’re the only baritone crooner
we got left… Sinatra, Elvis, Crosby, you’re as good as they are, but WHY
ARE YOU</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Catchy, you sold it to a commercial?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: For that? How much did you get for it?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Now, Jim…</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: It was $50,000. You weren’t talking to us
that week and we figgered you…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You figured? What the fuck is this Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: It’s not like a big deal Jim, the song’s
already been commercialized, the money was great. Robbie wrote the
lyrics and he didn’t mind, neither did I, neither did John… we gotta get
to TV.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What?… are you saying? Are we the Doors? One
for all and all for one? Do you know what you’re saying to those
millions of kids! “Just kidding, not real”. That’s what you’re
saying.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh come on man, you think just cause you’re
the lead man in the band you can run the whole show.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: You think I was kidding Ray? Hey John, those
are interesting shoes, you like those shoes?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah I do.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Good. Then do you want 50 of those shoes?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Then what do you need more money for?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’m dying Ray. I wasn’t kidding. Maybe you
were. But I’ll tell you something, it’s not about these desires you have
man, or money, or these records, it’s about breaking through wasn’t it?
You just lost something man. We all lost something boys. We lost
something.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t think so Jim. There’s a bigger picture
here.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: There sure is. In your fucking face!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Just kidding… Hi Pam. Just watchin’ some
TV.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I wanted you to find us Jim. It meant
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I know. I know.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: You don’t have to torture me Jim. Let me make
it up to you, please…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’s alright honey, it’s gonna be alright.
You’re my girl and that’s the way it’s always gonna stay.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: Really…?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: So, let’s keep that money machine rolling. Come
on guys…</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Right on Jimbo.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: When I was back there in seminary school There
was a person there Who put forth the proposition That you can petition
the Lord with prayer Petition the Lord with prayer Petition the Lord
with prayer</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Where the hell did she go?</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: Can you give me sanctuary I must
find a place to hide A place for me to hide…</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: …sing to me, Jim, sing to me.</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: Can you find me soft asylum I can’t
make it any more The man is at the door</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: Catacombs, nursury bones Winter
women Streets and shoes, avenues Leather riders selling shoes Successful
hills are here to stay Everything must be this way Gentle street where
people play Welcome to the soft parade</p>
<p><strong>jim &amp; doors</strong>: All our lives we sweat and save
Building for a shallow grave The soft parade has now begun Listen to the
engines hum People out to have some fun A cobra on my left Leopard on my
right</p>
<p><strong>jim song</strong>: Calling on the dogs When all else fails
You can whip the horses’ eyes And make them sleep And cry.</p>
<p><strong>pam</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why does my mind circle around you? Why do
planets wonder what it would be like to be you? All your soft wild
promises were words, birds, Endlessly in flight Being drunk is the best
disguise As the body is ravaged The spirit grows stronger</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Let’s send out for some pizza Jim.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Nah, how ’bout some tacos when we’re through?
The world on fire Taxi from Africa The grand hotel he was drunk a big
party last night back, going back in all directions sleeping these
insane hours I’ll never wake up in a good mood again I’m sick of these
stinky boots Do you know we are being led to slaughters by placid
admirals? And that fat slow generals are getting obscene on young blood?
Do you know we are ruled by TV?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh great Creator of Being Grant us one more
hour to perform our art and perfect our lives The moths and atheists are
doubly divine in dying We live, we die, and death not ends it Journey we
more into the nightmare We’re reaching for death on the end of a candle
We’re trying for something that’s already found us…</p>
<p><strong>radio dj/critic</strong>: A hot night in Miami January ’69 –
every space in the auditorium is consumed… unfortunately the Doors have
long since sold out. They’ve become an act. Morrison “falls” off the
stage at least every other performance. “The Soft Parade” album only
confirms the plasticity of their approach. Songs like “Touch Me” and
“Follow Me Down” are not the Doors we once knew. So the question is: Why
am I here? Are funerals entertainment?</p>
<p><strong>densmore</strong>: He ain’t gonna show! I know it man. We
should fuckin’ go on without him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Bill’s with him. They’re an hour away, he’ll
get him here.</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: Goddamit Jim! We missed one already, we
gotta get this one man!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: More!</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Four more all around and up and down!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Don’t be so melodramatic Bill, it’s not fun
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>dog</strong>: I can’t fly sober.</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: Jim, you don’t show for this one, we’re
dead, the whole group – no more bookings.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I care.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Come on Jim, we’ll get fuckin’ laid in
Miami.</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: We need the work Jim! They’re making us
post a $10,000 bond just to show up – we’re the only group in rock-n-
roll with a fuck clause! Get him on the fuckin’ plane. That’s what I pay
you for.</p>
<p><strong>dog</strong>: You’re an awful little guy to be talking like
that.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Chump change, we’re working for chump
change.</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: Look at you, you’re a pathetic fuckin’ slob
and so are all your friends!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I got an idea Bill, you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen to ‘em! They’re not coming for the
music anymore. They’re coming to see a fuckin’ freak show!</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: You think it’s easy for him. He moves left he’s
got vice squad, on the right narcs – and the audience just waiting for
him to get busted.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He wanted it! Not us. I just don’t fuckin’ get
the point anymore. I never did I guess. Y’ask me he’s just become a
drunken fuckin’ asshole that’s what. And he’s gonna take us down with
him.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Compassion was never your forte man.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t lecture me Mr. Philosopher, you never
felt a fuckin thing in your life. I loved that man. I loved what he
was.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: It ain’t the old Jim that’s for sure. I
think he’s living for everybody else man and somewhere along the way
he’s lost his own self.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: The wine man, the ancient wine. The ancient
wine.</p>
<p><strong>robbie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Something he once told us. About Dionysos. When
the madness took over…</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: My name is Rita Hager and if…</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: If your name is Rita, then yor ol man must be
ol man Rita!!</p>
<p><strong>tom, mike &amp; dog</strong>: That ol man Riva, he just keep
rolling along!</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Excuse me sir, my father is not my old
man.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: In the event of a decrease of pressure,
pull the oxygen mask to your…</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Ma ol lady had one of those but she calls it a
diaphragm when I’m eating her out!</p>
<p><strong>dog</strong>: Nah, it’s a douche bag on a dixie cup.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: I’m sorry sir, but you’re embarrassing
me.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Great tits.</p>
<p><strong>siddons</strong>: Come on guys, cool it!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: in the row behind</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: No I can’t and I won’t.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: Cause I don’t want to participate in anything
that would accomplish your goal?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Oh and what is my goal Paul? Death?</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: “Death old friend”.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Wrong. I just want the pure beauty of absolute
zero and sing the blues man – do nuthin, go nowhere, just be.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: With that waistline Jimbo you got no
choice.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: What’s wrong with being a large mammal, a big
beast like a tank. I feel great!</p>
<p><strong>dog</strong>: Yeah. What’s wrong with being fat.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: You mean “Crawling King Flab”? Rock is cock
babe and your rock is dyin’.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Rock is death! There is no longer belief. Hey,
I’ll write poetry and direct movies.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: And what are you offering? Sex? You can’t get
it up. Salvation? You can’t even save yourself. Come on Jim, you’re not
gonna be remembered.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Miss?…</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: What do you need?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Some love.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: They’ll still be talking about Jim when you’re
a walk on Baker. I’ll make you a deal. When you do something, I’ll
criticize it.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: I think you both should take your heads out of
the toilet bowl. After “Soft Parade” You need an album sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: You should take it outta your ass.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: The first two novels come along they love you,
next few they slam but if you stay around long enough, one day they say,
“hey he’s part of the national psyche”.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: Screwdrives-her.</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: I’m going to have to call the captain if
you can’t control these people. I guarantee that.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: …if you live long enough, don’t kid yourself
Jimbo – you’re all alone out there, Jimbo, cept for me, cause you’re too
wacked out man, they’re scared, you’re too fuckin crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I wasn’t mad, Tom. I was only interested in
freedom.</p>
<p><strong>tom</strong>: Bullshit! You’re bored, you’re not free. You
tested all the limits, fame, fucking, money, – whatcha gonna do now

<p><strong>jim</strong>: Patricia, wouldn’t it be better to have a kid
with someone who wanted to be its father?</p>

be! You and me. The child would be a god, goddess!</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It’d be a monster.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I got this trial dragging on me, Patricia. I
couldn’t support the kid – I can’t afford it and I don’t want the
responsibility right now.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: You’re a COWARD!! A LITTLE BOY!! The only
way you can’t afford it is emotionally. You forgot your vows man. They

<p><strong>jim</strong>: Yes I will.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: Bullshit Morrison You know who you are…
NO. What difference does it make. You know, you never pretended. I did.
I don’t even like kids particularly, but I don’t want the other thing
either. I guess what I really want is to throw myself off this fucking
balcony Well now that you’ve fucked the future, Morrison, have you
fucked everything?… Have you looked at yourself in the mirror. Your

anything about that, it’s just uh did you take your pants off y’know, I

be? Gotta try to start over, without all the hassles, y’know. I think we
can.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I never knew what you saw in that nightmare
chick man.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well she is kinda flakey – like me. I mean
she’s just so vulnerable about everything. It makes me sad man. But
she’s always kinda believed in something about me y’know – her little
picture of me as the unsung poet – and it’s a fantasy I kinda dig
y’know, ’stead of the one I live.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t know man, I don’t wanna sound like your
old man but you’re only 27, you’re living like you gotta get it all in,
you gotta slow down man, you did it, you broke thru to the other
side.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: We didn’t break thru Ray, we just pushed things
a little. When you really break thru, there’s nothing left. No music, no
Doors, no God, nothing – only a will to power.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: I don’t believe that. You were an American
prince, man – with overbred genes – No! What could’ve been Jim? You
could’ve been President. No man! What could’ve been Jim? We stood here
on this beach on the edge of the Pacific that crazy summer day in ’65 –
and we knew, you and I, we knew we were at the edge of the mind. we were
there, man. One planet, one globe, one mind. Consciousness, we raised
it, we were there.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: And now what?</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Now? You’ve made me into Ishmael. I am the last
survivor of the Pequod. And I exist only to tell the story of Ahab who
fought the black whale.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: It was white Ray. You gotta stop harpin’ on
that day. I was so ripped I can hardly remember it.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Hey, what was that poem you once wrote about
two chicks on the pier?</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Come on man, I gotta fly.</p>
<p><strong>ray</strong>: Come on. Just once.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: In that year we had a great Visitation of
energy Back in those days Everything was simpler and more confused One
summer night, going to the pier I ran into two young girls The blonde
was called Freedom The dark one Enterprise We talked And they told me
this story.</p>
<p>****: What was the story?</p>
<p><strong>morrison</strong>: Well, didja get all that?</p>
<p><strong>ghostman</strong>: You done good, Jim, go now – rest</p>

came my baby? Just like you said it’d be?</p>

how pale and wanton thrillful comes death at a strange hour? Unannounced
unplanned for like a scaring overfriendly guest you’ve brought to bed?
Death makes angels of us all? And gives us wings where we had shoulders
smooth as raven’s claws…</p>
<p>****: No more money, no more fancy dress this other kingdom seems by
far the best until its other jaw reveals incest and loose obedience to a
vegetable law. I will not go I prefer a feast of friends to the giant
family…</p>

Angeles California – The Doors!</p>

Have you been born yet and are you alive? Where is the feast we were
promised? Let’s reinvent the gods, the myths of the ages! We need great
golden copulations</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you a story of whiskey, mystics
and men And about the believers and how the whole thing began First
there were women and children obeying the moon Then daylight brought
wisdom and sickness too soon… the moon is a dry blood beast We have
assembled inside this ancient and insane theatre to propagate our lust
for life and flee the swarming wisdom of the streets we live we die and
death not ends it</p>

Take me on your flight I will come again down from the wild
mountains</p>
