<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’ll be out in about 35-40 minutes!</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Hurry up; today is Fri-day! And we gotta
hit the high-way!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Soon as my pops found out what Debo said to
Ezal, he wanted me to move with my uncle and little cousin in Rancho
Cucamonga. Til’ things calm down, or Debo went back to prison. Whichever
comes first.</p>

traffic.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Here I come!</p>

<p><strong>craig</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: I fell in some mud. Now hurry up!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I didn’t wanna leave my neighborhood at all.
Especially my homeboy Smokey. But he went to rehab last week. I know
I’mma miss him…</p>
<p><strong>debo</strong>: Craig! Get out the car, boy! This the

<p><strong>craig</strong>: Daddy, punch it!</p>
<p><strong>debo</strong>: You know I’mma find you! You can run ya’ can’t
hide!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You fake ass Suge Knight!</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: That nigga worst than them damn pit
bulldogs or something! That’s why moving wit’cha Uncle Elroy and Cousin
Day-Day is the best thing for you right now.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Ya’ll making me look like a punk.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: It ain’t about being a punk, son. It’s
about this…</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What’s that smell?</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Must be your upper lip, ’cause I don’t
smell nothing.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: What it smell like?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Smells like you didn’t fall in no mud.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: I gotta get’em fixed. They don’t roll
down.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: All damn.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Just hold your breath.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Nice neighborhood, huh?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: It’s alright.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: 18-years of chasing dogs; and my lazy ass
brother hits the lotto his first time playing. I still can’t figure that
one out.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Why they got to have the loudest house on the
block!</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Ah, son, don’t be no hater. You know your
uncle ain’t got no taste. Just don’t let him rub off on you.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You coming in?</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: No, I’mma go on to work. I don’t wanna
hear Elroy’s mouth. Now listen to me, Craig. It’s gonna be different
living over here. Don’t let your uncle and your cousin get you into no
shit. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hey, Pops, I’m grown. Can’t nobody get me in
trouble no more.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Daddy, Craig is here.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What’s crackin’?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: You. Hi, Uncle Willie.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Hey, Day-Day. Where’s yo’ big head
father?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: There he is.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Hey, Debo, heard you running from a
ass- whippin’?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Naw, it ain’t like that.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: If you see that boy again, bite off his
ear off like Mike Tyson.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Alright, I’ll remember that.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: You know me? I would’ve shot his big
ass. Hey, Willie, how’s it going? Still steppin’ in dog shit every
day?</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Make sure you look after my son out here.
Don’t get him involved with none of your bullshit, Roy.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Don’t worry ‘bout nothin’, big bro. He
in the best fuckin’ hands in Rancho Chocomunga, baby! This my world, you
just a nigga late paying rent. Ain’t that right, nephew?</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Craig, remember what I told you.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’ll remember.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Send Betty my love. Boy you looking
good. I’mma take these in the house for you, man… and when you finish
with this cat, come inside. I got something to show you.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Thanks, Unc.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: You know it’s been over a year since we
kicked it last? Up at the family reunion.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I know, that’s when Uncle Elroy cussed out
everybody, and threw up in Aunt Faye’s backseat.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Yep. I forgot about him cussin’ out
everybody. Damn that was fun.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I know, we had a good time. But ever since
you guys moved out here, it seems like we’ve lost touch.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I know; this a long way from Watts. But
what I like about living out here is that you don’t hear no helicopters,
no sirens, no drive-by’s, no nothing. Just peace and quiet. Listen.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Joker, he just got out of the pen. Li’l
Joker, he just got out of Youth Authority. And Baby Joker, he just got
out of Juvenile Hall.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: They ever let you hit the switches on that
Cadillac?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Naw, them dudes is assholes. Especially
that dog - Cheeco. Watch this little ass, he’s sneaky. Plus, I got
something better than a Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: This you?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Yeah, that’s me. Just a little somethin’
somethin’ I picked up.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Must be nice. I wish we won the lottery. Come
up on a million dollars like ya’ll.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Man, after taxes, lawyer fees, and paying
off my daddy’s bad credit, we didn’t end up with a million. We bought
this house and I spent the rest on this. It’s the bomb, huh?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: This my baby. I feel like a new nigga in this
car. I get mo’ phone numbers rollin’ this, than I ever did on the
bus.</p>

<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah, I’m ’bout it.</p>
<p><strong>miss ho kym</strong>: Well, then, it’s all good. Yo, Day-Day,

<p><strong>craig</strong>: What kind of activity?</p>

<p><strong>suga</strong>: Okay. Bye, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>

house. What you doing over here?</p>
<p><strong>d’wana</strong>: What it look like I’m doing? You can’t quit

<p><strong>day-day</strong>: That ain’t my baby!</p>
<p><strong>d’wana</strong>: I got your bitch right here.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Awwwww…. Awwwww….</p>
<p><strong>d’wana</strong>: I expect you to return all phone calls and
take me to lunch today. I’ll be back out here on my break. Nobody quits
me.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I can’t see! I can’t see! Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Lay down, Day-Day. Stop moving.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: She pepper-sprayed me, man! She pepper-
sprayed me!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I know, be still.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Boy, you got you a little fatal
attraction, huh? I had two or three of them in my day.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That’s too much water.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Help him to his feet. Let’s get him to
the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Hold on. What you doing?</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Wet your eyes, boy. Stay in there for
about 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: 20 minutes?</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Yeah, 20 minutes. Trust me. I’ve been
pepper sprayed nine times. 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Yeah, you gotta have a little money to
live out here, Craig. I never thought I’d be the kinda nigga to move to
the suburbs. But as soon as I got my check, I was gone. Paid 230
thousand dollars cash on this house.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You paid cash?</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Cash money. They wasn’t gonna stick me
with no 30-year payment plan. That’s for suckas. They got my daddy like
that for a Cadillac years ago. I got the only house on the block that’s
paid for. That’s why I’m the king around here.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: It’s cool, but where’s the water?</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Don’t need water. We didn’t have no
pool in the projects…so none of us swim.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Y’all never use it?</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Never… But me and Suga can get real
nasty in that Jacuzzi, though.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That’s okay, Unc. I can’t swim, either.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>crack dealer</strong>: Ezal, I’m sick of you coming around
here wit no money.</p>
<p><strong>ezal</strong>: I be damned.</p>
<p><strong>debo</strong>: Where did Craig move to?</p>
<p><strong>ezal</strong>: I don’t know, Debo.</p>
<p><strong>debo</strong>: What you say?</p>
<p><strong>ezal</strong>: He moved out to Rancho Cucamonga with his
cousin Day-Day.</p>
<p><strong>debo</strong>: Rancho Cucamonga?</p>
<p><strong>ezal</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>debo</strong>: Get on.</p>
<p><strong>ezal</strong>: Man, we can’t ride to Rancho Cucamonga on
that.</p>
<p><strong>debo</strong>: Get on!</p>
<p><strong>ezal</strong>: Just don’t go over the curb.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You straight?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Yeah, I’m alright. Is my face still orange
to you?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Just a little.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I can’t taste nothing.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What’s the matter with your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Man, it’s a long story. I met D’Wana three
months ago. She had a little pudge in her stomach but I didn’t pay it no
attention. Come to find out, she six months pregnant. Saying I’m the
daddy!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Yeah, I broke up with her two Fridays ago
and she’s been harassing me ever since. She don’t care about the
restraining order or nothing.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Restraining order? Where the hell you meet
this girl?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I went back to Watts to sell my old car and
met her on the way. Worst day of my life.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Damn, you got a stalker.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: That ain’t the worst part. Her little
sister, Baby D. She’s the one that gets real physical. But I got a
restraining order on her, too.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You got a restraining order on a little girl
named Baby D?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: You don’t know Baby D.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Who is that?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: That’s the sister.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yo know what? I’m starting to like Rancho
Cucamonga.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I know what ’cha thinking. I thought the
same thing. But it can’t happen.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Because, it’s been a little tension between
us ever since they got out the joint and ran their momma crazy. And I’m
just trying to keep the peace. We moved out here to get away from that
shit.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah, it’s bad. And that scratch make it
ugly.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Alright, alright… I see what you talking
about.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hold up, Day-Day.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Let it go.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hey! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Karla.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Craig and Karla, damn that sound pretty good
together. Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: To the Cucamonga shopping center.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Oh yeah, why you walking?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: My brothers won’t give me a ride.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Just get the number and come on. Just get
the number and come on.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You want us to give you a ride?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What you mean, you don’t know? Just wait
here.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Cheeco!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Cheeco, no!</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Oh shit, jump!</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Get yo dumb ass in the back.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Look at my roof.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Why not? She was cool with it.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What you mean, so?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: If you ‘get into it’ with them S.A.’s and
start a feud, you can always go back to home. I gotta live here. Just
remember that.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Nephew, you got perfect timing…</p>
<p><strong>suga</strong>: Come on, Craig. Sit down right here.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: I know you smoke weed, right?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Why you say that?</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: ’Cause your lips is getting black.</p>
<p><strong>suga</strong>: Would you like a glass of wine, baby?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No thank you. It’s too early.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Boy, I can roll a blunt better than
them bitches in Havana. I know Willie don’t let’cha smoke in the house,
but I’m ya uncle. I don’t care how high you get in my house. Long as you
let me hit it…</p>
<p><strong>suga</strong>: Fire it up, Roy.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Now I’mma show you the real “Puff
Daddy.”</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Suga.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Negro, what the hell you doing to my
woman?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I don’t know!</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Suga!</p>
<p><strong>suga</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: What you doing to my nephew?</p>
<p><strong>suga</strong>: Ah, baby…I thought this was you. Craig, what
are you doing to me?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I don’t know, I think I passed out or
something. I don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Passed out? Can’t hang, huh? Boy, I
knew you was a lightweight. Passed out on one funky ass blunt. They
don’t make ’em like they used to, baby.</p>
<p><strong>suga</strong>: Mr. Nasty time?</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Mr. Nasty time. But take it easy on me,
girl.</p>
<p><strong>suga</strong>: Craig, you ain’t the only lightweight around
here.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Make yourself at home.</p>
<p><strong>smokey</strong>: Hi, my name is Smokey. And I’m a bud- head.
But here at the King/Drew Rehab Center, they help you curve your crave
for marijuana but still let you get your drank on.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Oh, baby, right there. Right there…bite
the nipple, baby. Bite it! Bite it! Yeah, mothafucka – yeah, come on,

<p><strong>day-day</strong>: You already in.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: No. You can’t handle a girl like D’Wana.
It’s got to be Craig.</p>
<p><strong>d’wana</strong>: That white boy said he was in there.</p>
<p><strong>baby’d</strong>: Day-Day, don’t make me break this

<p><strong>craig</strong>: Right this way. You know damn well you don’t

<p><strong>karla</strong>: Hello, remember me?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hell yeah, I remember you.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I’m sorry for what my brother did this
morning. They’re assholes.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: It’s cool. You ain’t got to apologize for
your brothers. They’re big boys.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I just wanted to give you this.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Most definitely.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Better sooner than later.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Baby’D, you’re not going to catch me as
usual. So what can we do to end it this time? What you want? Another Big
Pun CD? ’Cause I gotta get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>baby’d</strong>: Okay, I know what I want this time.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Anything you need.</p>
<p><strong>baby’d</strong>: Yo’ cousin, Craig. Hook us up.</p>

<p><strong>day-day</strong>: And I can go free?</p>
<p><strong>baby’d</strong>: Go, fo’ I change my mind.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Great moves, Day-Day.</p>

go over there and talk to Baby’D.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What you mean talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: You know what he mean, dude.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m gone.</p>
<p><strong>baby’d</strong>: I’mma get you, Day-Day! You gotta come out
sometimes!</p>
<p><strong>d’wana</strong>: I told you.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: You don’t wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Thanks a lot, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I know we cousins and all, but don’t try an’
hook me up with the big little sisters.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Big bitches need love, too, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: For sure. That’s how I like ’em.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Not me.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Are they still out there?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Negative…they vamped.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Day-Day?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Today ain’t my day.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Bummer, huh? And Friday is suppose to be a
kick-ass day.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yeah it is…the best day before the
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: That’s fuckin’ poetic, Craig.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What’s the green stuff poking out?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: That’s cron-don, sir. My mom hates for me to
smoke, so she made me bud-brownies. Wanna bite?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Naw, I already ate.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Come on, Day, try it. For moms.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: It ain’t a bong but, wa-la!</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Wo!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Sorry, bro, reflexes. How did you do
that?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Black magic.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Give me dat. I’m the one with the
problem.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Weed doesn’t solve problems. It eases the
mind, and the soul. Enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I didn’t think you smoked bud that much.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Damn nigga, don’t Jack the joint. I didn’t
even pass it.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Sorry, dude.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You better open up a window or something
before the smell gets out.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Ain’t no windows in here.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I got an idea.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Blow.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That ain’t gonna work.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Fuck yeah.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: It works.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Still gonna smell it.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: No way. Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>pinky</strong>: Look, man, you hittin’ them goddamn corners
too fast. Slow down. I almost spilled my Hennessy on this 300 dollar
suit.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Roach, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: R-U-S-H Intensely.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: This vacuum don’t work. Where’s the
restroom?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Out the door and to the left.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I thought the vacuum would work.</p>
<p><strong>pinky</strong>: Don’t move or I’ll blow your head smooth
off.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I ain’t trying to rob you…</p>
<p><strong>pinky</strong>: Shut up! Fo’ I pump this Glock in yo’ ass!
What did you do wit Day-Day and Roach?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Man, Day-Day is my people!</p>
<p><strong>pinky</strong>: I said shut up! Now who sent you?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Nobody!</p>
<p><strong>pinky</strong>: If you say another word, it’s over. I’m not
playing!</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I gotta think of a plan to get this money
before tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: You could sell your Beamer.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I don’t know. I hope Craig got a good idea.
We gotta ask him when he comes out. Let’s go and clean up before Pinky
gets here.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Maybe you can ask him to loan you the
money.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Yoooo, that’s it. You ain’t as dumb as I
think you are, Roach.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>pinky</strong>: Don’t kill me.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Shut up. I been trying to tell yo’ ass that…
Day-Day is my cousin. They’re right there in the back.</p>
<p><strong>pinky</strong>: Whatever you say, man. I didn’t see shit. The
safe combination is 34-5-27. Just take it all.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Craig, what the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>pinky</strong>: Day-Day, is this your cousin?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>pinky</strong>: Good. You fired…and, Roach, your fired
too.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>pinky</strong>: I smell weed.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Just hold on, Craig. I’m on my way.</p>
<p><strong>ezal</strong>: Debo! Debo!</p>
<p><strong>debo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ezal</strong>: I can’t feel my legs no more.</p>
<p><strong>debo</strong>: Me neither. How far is Rancho Cucamonga?</p>
<p><strong>ezal</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: In a strange way, I feel responsible for
Day-Day getting fired. If I wouldn’t have fought Pinky, and gave Day-Day
the joint, he’d still have a job.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: Ah damn. Damn.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I got fired too.</p>
<p><strong>uncle elroy</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Man, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Say, man, what the hell you doing in
there? Open the door.</p>
<p><strong>michael jordan</strong>: Don’t nobody go in the bathroom for
about 35, 40 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>mr. jones</strong>: Hey, you that boy?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: What we gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I don’t know yet.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I know what I’mma do. Go home and face the
music. My dad is gonna kick my ass for getting fired again.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Alright, Roach, see you around.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Sorry about today, man.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Yeah, me too. Later.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Man, sit down. I can’t think with you
falling everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: My board!</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: What the fuck you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: You ran over my board!</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: So what? It shouldn’t have been in the
street.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Who the fuck is that, Day-Day?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Let it go, Roach, trust me.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I’m not letting nothing go. They killed my
board.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Let it go!</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Wait. Check’em out.</p>
<p><strong>baby joker</strong>: Get down.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You see that?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I didn’t see nothing.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: It’s something in that hydraulic pump.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Yeah, air.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Naw. I bet’cha it’s something better than
air.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: How you know? It could be anything.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I don’t know, and it could be anything. But I
just say we go take a look.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: I say we go over there and kick their asses.
I can take the little one.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Are you out your mind? I’m not messing with
them S.A.’s boy. You must be crazy.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Could be. Rather be crazy than homeless. Now
all we need is a big pack of baloney.</p>
<p><strong>both</strong>: Baloney??</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I thought you were taking me to see Mama?</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: I’ll take you later.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: When? After you get all drunk and loaded?</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Hey! I said I’ll take your fuckin’ ass later.
Now get out of here. You’re scaring our company.</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>li’l joker</strong>: What was what?</p>
<p><strong>girl #1</strong>: That silver thing.</p>
<p><strong>li’l joker</strong>: I didn’t see no silver thing, and
neither did you.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: This ain’t gonna work. I’m going back.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: It’s about to work, just come on.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: What about the dog?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That’s what the baloney’s for!</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Man, I don’t think I can do this, Craig. I
got the B-G’s.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What’s the B-G’s?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: The bubble guts. I’m so nervous it feels
like I’mma shit on myself.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Try an’ hold it, man. Squeeze your ass cheeks
together.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Butterflies, my ass. I’m about to go
home.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Look, Day-Day. If we don’t go over there and
take a look, this might be the last night you got a home. Now trust
me.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: You make it sound so easy.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: It is easy. You know why? ’Cause they’re not
expecting it. Now, Roach, you gotta occupy Cheeco. Long enough for me
and Day-Day to take a good look.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Dude, dogs hate me. I don’t know why. Me and
K-9’s just don’t get along.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Well get along with this one. Go ahead of us.
Don’t get seen and don’t let that mutt out of your sight.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Fuck, what’s his name?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Cheeco.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Here, Cheeco. Chee-co, here boy. That’s a
good boy.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Come on, he should have’em by now.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Hurry up. He didn’t have that much
baloney.</p>
<p><strong>li’l joker</strong>: Hey, homes, you guys better hurry up!
I’mma get greedy.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Look at those tig-ole-bitties</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You go first.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Naw, you go first.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: You go first.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Day-Day, if you don’t hop that fence I’mma
throw you over.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I ain’t scared of you. We ain’t little no
more.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I hope to God that dog is happy.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: My baloney has a first name. It’s C-h-e-
e-c-o.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Wait for what?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: He’s still over by Roach.</p>
<p><strong>baby joker</strong>: Want me to take a look?</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: No, keep working.</p>
<p><strong>li’l joker</strong>: Yo, man fuck that shit. Do it later.
It’s Friday, time to party, SA.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Close the door.</p>
<p><strong>li’l joker</strong>: Not until you come party with us,
man.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Alright, put it in that drawer.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: What you see?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: That pump was full of money. I saw where they
put it. Stay right here, I’mma climb in and go get it.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Wait here? So Cheeco can bite my ass off?
Tell me where it is I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: No, man, just wait.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: I got the B-G’s.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Good boy. Nice dog.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: No lungs, baby. No lungs.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Fuck that.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: I don’t want no doors locked around here. You
hear me?</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Oh, poppy, I like it rough.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: Good, ’cause that’s how you gonna get it.</p>
<p><strong>li’l joker</strong>: Karla!</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I hope you don’t think I’m crazy, but I just
had to come in here and show you I ain’t scared of yo’ punk ass
brothers…and you wouldn’t have be scared of ‘em neither if you had a man
like me in yo’ life.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: What?? So you snuck in my room to tell me
that?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Yes I did. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>li’l joker</strong>: Who you talking to?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Nobody.</p>
<p><strong>li’l joker</strong>: I heard a voice.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: No you didn’t. Get out my room. Go back down
to your little girlfriends.</p>
<p><strong>girl #2</strong>: Shut the window.</p>
<p><strong>joker</strong>: You shut the window.</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Oh shit.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: …like I was saying. A guy like me, and a dog
like you, don’t need this bullshit. We need to be in Maui renting jet
ski to fat funks in flower shirts. You feel me,</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Roach…Roach, come on.</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Where’s Craig?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: He’s inside the house?</p>
<p><strong>roach</strong>: Why did he go in the house?</p>
<p><strong>day-day</strong>: Don’t worry about it. We gotta figure out a
way to get Craig out of there. He’s probably getting tied up now.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: You did all this for me?</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Most of it. I just hate to see you in this
situation.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Thanks for noticing. It used ta be peaceful
before they got out. Took over the house and caused my mother’s nervous
breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: Why didn’t she put’em out?</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: Easier said than done. We saved up to get
away from them, but they followed us.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I’m sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>karla</strong>: I thought you came up here to see me.</p>
<p><strong>craig</strong>: I did. Is that door locked?</p>
