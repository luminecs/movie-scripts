pietermaritzburg,</strong>: NATAL. NIGHT.</p>
<p><strong>bartle frere</strong>: Reading aloud the letter he has just
written.</p>
<p><strong>bartle frere</strong>: He continues to read aloud:</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford,</strong>: however, continues to read, turning the
page.</p>
<p><strong>bartle frere</strong>: You ’11 see from the letter that this
ultimatum is our decision alone. Her Majesty’s government seems to
prefer a negotiated settlement</p>
<p><strong>bartle frere</strong>: Does this do what we both know to be
right Frederick?</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: It does Sir Henry excellently.</p>
<p><strong>15. ext. chelmsford’s camp pietermaritzburg. day</strong>:

<p><strong>pte. williams</strong>: I’m to tell you Corporal, that I love
you more than my Colour Sergeant</p>
<p><strong>nco</strong>: That’s frightening… Get out of my bloody sight
lad. And put your rifle over your head and double round this field until
you drop bloody dead. Now move, get on with it, at the double.</p>
<p><strong>nco</strong>: Shut up! Get back in the ranks you shower of
animals.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. williams</strong>: Facing the ranks: Company Shoulder
arms…. Present arms.</p>
<p><strong>elderly boer</strong>: We ’ve come to fight the Zulu.</p>
<p><strong>sgt. williams</strong>: We aren’t at war yet Referring to the
boy: Bit young ‘in’ he?</p>
<p><strong>elderly boer</strong>: He’s my nephew… he can shoot, track
and speak Zulu and fight like hell… he’s got Assegai marks to prove
it…</p>
<p><strong>sgt. williams</strong>: BOY-PULLEN</p>
<p><strong>boy-pullen</strong>: . Colour Sergeant Addressing the BOERS:
This way.</p>

know each one by name.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: They come well recommended do they?
DURNFORD</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Oh… indeed. Crealock, we should see that
Colonel Dumford has an Officer for his hard riders. Perhaps a subaltern
from the Twenty Fourth.</p>
<p><strong>durnford</strong>: I thought it might be more effective to
find someone who speaks Zulu.</p>
<p><strong>crealock</strong>: Yes. I see you’ve issued each of them with
a Martini Henry Carbine. Our quota for Native contingencies: one rifle
to ten men and only five rounds per rifle.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: But will they make good use of them?</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: There’s no doubting their horsemanship
Colonel Durnford.</p>
<p><strong>durnford</strong>: Mr. Crealock.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: We must think how to make best use of
Colonel Durnford’s African knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: Colonel Durnford… William Vereker. I hear
you ’ve been seeking Officers?</p>
<p><strong>durnford</strong>: Good ones, yes, Mr Vereker. Gentlemen who
can ride and shoot</p>
<p><strong>sgt. williams</strong>: Shouting across the field: Private
Williams. You’ve stopped.</p>
<p><strong>durnford</strong>: Mr. Raw. Take Mr. Vereker to the Store and
see he ’5 issued the necessary equipment And then show him to the Mess

classifying his specimens.</p>

Dumford scored quite a coup with the Sikali Horse.</p>
<p><strong>coghill</strong>: Um. There are rumours that my Lord
Chelmsford intends to make Durnford Second in Command.</p>
<p><strong>melvill</strong>: Well that’s typical of Her Majesty’s army.
Appoint an engineer to do a soldier’s work.</p>
<p><strong>pulleine</strong>: He continues writing without looking up:
Now, now Mr. Melvill, less of your spleen.</p>
<p><strong>raw</strong>: Addressing the Mess: Stranger in the Mess.
Gentlemen. My LorJ</p>
<p><strong>raw</strong>: To VEREKER: Announce yourself</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: Good day Frederick. 9</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Good day William. . Pleased you could
join us.</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: It was either that, or join the Zulu.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: . Join the Zulu? Oh yes, you’re right in
the thick of it aren’t you? Talked to your father before we sailed.. he
said you ’d taken to farming near Zulu land. Sent his regards.. Should I
meet up with you. VEREKER That was nice of the old boy.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: I think you ’d better call out who you
are.</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: William Vereker.</p>
<p><strong>murphy</strong>: Sir?</p>
<p><strong>raw</strong>: Bring drinks for the stranger. Allow me to
introduce the Mess: Colonel Pulleine. Messers. Melvill, Coghill…</p>

I0</p>
<p><strong>stevenson</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>raw</strong>: Haiford. . and Haiford’s best frienJ</p>
<p><strong>russell</strong>: Don ’t leave your gin around, Vereker, or
Harford will have it full of preserved butteifties. A damned waste, if
you ask me.</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: Oh I doubt if I’ll leave much of that
around. There’s quite a shortage where I’ve been.</p>
<p><strong>coghill</strong>: Puffing on his cigar: Theyfight with spears
don ’t they? I mean it doesn’t seem quite fair against the Martini
Henry.</p>
<p><strong>melvill</strong>: You didn’t really have to chose between
your country and the Zulu did you?</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: Um. And a damn close thing it was too.</p>
<p><strong>raw</strong>: Taking the freshly filled trophy from MURPHY.
Ah, well done Murphy. .</p>
<p><strong>harford</strong>: Stranger’s Cup. Down it in one and we where
share your Mess bill for a week.</p>

the Mess is charged to your account</p>
<p><strong>melvill</strong>: if it’s too much we can have the bill
forwarded to your father… in the 11</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: No offence taken, Melvill. . To men who
aren ’t afraid to speak their minds.</p>
<p><strong>raw</strong>: Good luck, Sir</p>
<p><strong>raw</strong>: Standing, he raises his glass to propose a
toast: The Regiment</p>
<p><strong>officers</strong>: The Regiment</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: Still smiling, he wipes the remaining wine
from the corners of his moustache. The Regiment.</p>
<p><strong>indunas</strong>: . They surround two young Zulu warriors who
are tautly circling. Their shields are held at the defensive, their
assegais poised for underhand thrust.</p>

British, and from the Great Lord ChelmsforJ</p>
<p><strong>cetshwayo</strong>: Still watching the fighting Zulus; And
what do your Masters say?</p>
<p><strong>mantshonga</strong>: They are angry and send these demands.
They say you rule in old ways that are wrong, that you kill your people
without triaL The Great White Queen herself cannot kill her lowliest
subject though she rules forty lands, each greater than all
ofZululanJ</p>
<p><strong>bayele</strong>: Kill the Traitor, Father’</p>

kill, under the customs of the Zulu, and I shall not depart from that Do
I go to the country of the white man and tell him to change his laws and
customs?</p>
<p><strong>mantshonga</strong>: The British say your armies grow larger
and they demand that you disband your lmpis of War</p>
<p><strong>cetshwayo</strong>: Tell the British I will not cross the
river which divides our lands. But ask Lord Chelmsford if he would
disarm his warriors in the face of such threats.</p>
<p><strong>mantshonga</strong>: I will ask him but his answer will be to
start war against your 30,000 warriors. CETSHWAYO My armies will defend

15</p>
<p><strong>bartle frere</strong>: She exists.. .but er. . .nothing ’5
been heard of her, the eight years Durnford’s been in Africa.</p>
<p><strong>crealock</strong>: Although much is spoken of her now, My
Lord.</p>

<p><strong>pulleine</strong>: Officer Vereker, er, would you mind me
asking you to take a look at this map? 33</p>
<p><strong>pulleine</strong>: You see</p>
<p><strong>pulleine</strong>: What about my wagons?</p>
<p><strong>elderly boer</strong>: On an open slope like this, you must
bring your wagons round and form them into a laager and do it
immediately</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: dismounts and addresses PULLEINE.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: I hear you have prisoners, Colonel, well
done. Good evening, William.</p>
<p><strong>pulleine</strong>: Thank you, Sir</p>

hear this. You were saying your brother didn ’t laager his camp
right?</p>
<p><strong>elderly boer</strong>: They had seventy-three in their party.
We found seventy-three skeletons six months later</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: You’re leaving us Master Boer?</p>
<p><strong>elderly boer</strong>: I’m going to camp among the rocks over
there. 34</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Unlikely most unlikely. It would mean
taking 24,000 men over mountain tops. This is not helpfuL Have the
prisoners brought to my camp.</p>

<p><strong>vereker</strong>: Be sensible man, tell us.</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: passes RUSSELL busy oiling the elevating
mechanisms on his rocket tubes.</p>
<p><strong>pulleine</strong>: What did they say?</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: Claim they’re deserters from the main Impis
in the East. Followed this way so they could give themselves up, go
home.</p>
<p><strong>pulleine</strong>: Do you believe that?</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: Oh their bodies are well oiled. They ’re
fed regularly, but it’s unlikely they’re the fugitives they say.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Have them questioned further</p>
<p><strong>fannin</strong>: Wherever they are, Your Worship, there are
sixty thousand or more</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: They multiply, Mr Fannin. You do speak
the Zulu tongue, do you?</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: And tomorrow I intend to find the Zulu
Impis, Mr Fannin, and you will accompany me.</p>
<p><strong>fannin</strong>: Er, I’m no soldier, Your Honour, and it ’s
further into Zululand.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: You will accompany me, Mr Fannin, or you
will be arrested.</p>
<p><strong>pulleine</strong>: This way, Mr Fannin.</p>

direction he claims he saw the Zulus? 36 CREALOCK</p>

come from the direction of the Royal Kraal, at Ulundi.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>boy-pullen</strong>: Why don ’t the Zulus attack?</p>
<p><strong>bloomfield</strong>: Zulu may not wear shoes or trousers and
the like but it don ’t mean to say they got no brains. They’ll watch us
and wait and find our weaknesses.</p>

<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Intelligence? Sources of your own? Did
it not occur to you they may be native rumours? Rumours to draw you off-
to leave the whole ofNatal open to a possible counter thrust</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Are you dictating the strategy of this
war, Sir?</p>
<p><strong>durnford</strong>: I’m explaining my reasons.</p>

Ulundi. Dumford, kindly return to your unit Bring them here immediately
to support Pulleine. Mr Vereker will join you as ADC. Do you understand
me clearly?</p>
<p><strong>durnford</strong>: And the threat of counter invasion no
longer exists? 40</p>
<p><strong>crealock</strong>: Perhaps he has thought to conquer Zululand
on his own, My LorJ</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: CHELMSFORD I trust you to keep me well
informed of Colonel Durnford and his men when they arrive William.</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: Certainly Frederick.</p>

<p><strong>coghill</strong>: How quickly can you move your artillery
forward?</p>
<p><strong>stuart smith</strong>: Well, my horses are feeding, as you
may observe, Mr Coghill. It’ll take a little while.</p>
<p><strong>coghill</strong>: Well, fed or hungry, Pulleine wants them in
position immediately. .</p>
<p><strong>stuart smith</strong>: Right. Bombardier, to me please.</p>

<p><strong>noggs</strong>: Crealock, old fellah . I’m doing notes for my
dispatch and I need to clear up afew military points. I don ’t want to
bother His Lordship. Had it drummed into my thick skull that a good
Commander never willingly splits his forces, especially in an enemy’s
country before knowing their dispositions.</p>
<p><strong>crealock</strong>: Ah, Yes, if we were facing a European
enemy armed with guns I think your point would hold, Noggs. Further, may
I remind you I do not create the strategies you wish to comment on. I am
only his Lordship’s Secretary. .</p>
<p><strong>noggs</strong>: With a slight chuckle he leans closer to
CREALOCK. I wouldn ’t take overly comfort from that Crealock old fellah
because if~he sinks, then you sink with him.</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: Well I assure you, Sir, I have no desire to
create difficulties. 45</p>
<p><strong>durnford</strong>: And I assure you, you do not In fact I’d
be obliged for your best advice. What have your scouts seen?</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: So far only their scouts. But we have had
reports of a small Impi farther north, over there.</p>
<p><strong>pulleine</strong>: His Lordship is of the certain opinion
that it ’s far too difficult an approach to be chosen by the Zulu
command.</p>
<p><strong>vereker</strong>: We don ’t know.</p>

the shot, rides towards TROOPER JAMES, but stops when he gets to the
ZULU BOY who is lying motionless on the ground. Dismounting, VEREKER

compassion.</p>

yesterday and there won ’t be any supplies until I get them back to
Isandhlwana.</p>
<p><strong>chelmsford</strong>: Well they can start off now and you can
join them when you’ve eaten.</p>

<p><strong>pulleine</strong>: Reinforcement only. And ride to Stuart
Smith. Let his guns cover Durnford for a fall back.</p>
