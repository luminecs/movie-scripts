<p><strong>juliet hulme</strong>: nearly 16 - tall, blond and
willowy,</p>
<p><strong>pauline rieper</strong>: 16 - dark-haired, shorter and
stockier than Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Mummy!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Mummy!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Mummy!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It’s Mummy!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: She’s terribly hurt . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Somebody’s got to help us!</p>
<p><strong>int. christchurch girls’ high - foyer - morning
music</strong>: “Just a Closer Walk With Thee,” sung by a HUNDRED
SCHOOLGIRLS.</p>
<p><strong>ext. school building/cranmer square - morning hymn continues
over</strong>: TRACKING . . . with a row of schoolgirl legs, marching in
a crocodile line across Cranmer Square.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: “Christchurch Girls’ High, 1952”</p>
<p><strong>miss stewart</strong>: Sit!</p>
<p><strong>laura</strong>: “He wanted her to give him some money.”</p>
<p><strong>miss waller</strong>: Put your hand up! I will not have girls
talking out of turn in my class!</p>
<p><strong>miss stewart</strong>: Good morning, gels.</p>
<p><strong>miss stewart</strong>: Miss Waller . . . class . . . this is
Juliet Hulme. Juliet is joining us from St. Margaret’s, and prior to
that she spent some time at Queenswood in the Hawkes Bay.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I am actually from England, Miss
Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>miss stewart</strong>: Of course . . . Juliet’s father is
Dr. Hulme, the Rector of the University.</p>
<p><strong>miss stewart</strong>: Juliet’s travelled all over the world,
and I’m sure she’ll be very eager to share her impressions of exotic
lands across the seas with the gels of 3A. I’ll leave you to it, Miss
Waller. Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>miss waller</strong>: You can sit over here, Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>miss waller</strong>: We use French names in this class. You
can choose your own.</p>
<p><strong>miss waller</strong>: Now, irregular verbs in the present
subjunctive. . . “qu’il vienne”. . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Excuse me, Miss Waller . . . you’ve made a
mistake.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: “Je doutais qu’il vienne” is in fact the
spoken subjunctive.</p>
<p><strong>miss waller</strong>: It is customary to stand when
addressing a teacher . . . “Antoinette.”</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: You should have written “vint.”</p>
<p><strong>miss waller</strong>: Oh! I must have copied it incorrectly
from my notes.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: You don’t have to apologise, Miss Waller. I
found it frightfully difficult myself . . . until I got the hang of
it.</p>
<p><strong>miss waller</strong>: Thank you, Juliet. Open your text-book
to page 17.</p>
<p><strong>int. school art class - day</strong>: The teacher, MRS.
COLLINS, comes in, carrying a pile of paper and a box of paints. She
starts to distribute them around the tables.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Right, I thought we’d do some life
drawing today. Pair off into twos and decide who wants to model and who
wants to draw.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Oh, Juliet. . . you haven’t got a
partner.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That s all right, Mrs. Collins. I’m sure I
can manage without one.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Pauline . . . are you with
anybody?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Good! You can come here and pair up
with Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: You might want to change the colour-
make it a bit darker . . . that’s very nice, Joan.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Good heavens, Juliet! What on earth is
this???</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: St. George and the Dragon.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Where’s Pauline?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Oh, I haven’t gotten around to drawing her
yet. I was going to pop her on a rock, but I seem to have run out
room.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Sorry! I don’t know if you’ve noticed,
Mrs. Collin but I’ve actually drawn St. George in the likeness of
world’s greatest tenor-Mario Lanza!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. collins</strong>: Yes, I know it’s very clever, Juliet,
but when I set you a topic, I expect you to follow it. Now put that down
and start again!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I think your drawing’s fantastic!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Oh! . . . Mackerel. We’ll have them for
lunch tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Let’s have ’em now, while they’re fresh,
eh, Nora?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: playfully shoves his hand away.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: I’ll think you’ll find our Mr. Bayliss is
not keen on seafood. I’ve got lamb chops in the ’frigerator.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: sighs as HONORA puts the frying pan on the
stove.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Excuse me . . . would you mind if I put my
long-playing record on?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: You’re partial to a nice bit of mackerel,
aren’t you, STEVE?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Well . . . actually, I’m not much of a fish
man, Mr. Rieper.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: glances at his album.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: You have been splashing out!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Oh! . . . I’ve got my board money . . .</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: starts fishing in his pockets.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Well? Tell us! How’d it go?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Got an A, Mum!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his
pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE’s hand.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Don’t worry about it now. We’ll sort it out
after dinner. You go put your record on.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Doris Day!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: I think she’s very talented!</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Ya gotta be quick in this house, mate!</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Hey! Isn’t it that Irish singer . . .
Murray O’ Lanza?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: He’s Italian, Dad! The world’s greatest
tenor!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Stop it! You’re spoiling it! Go away!</p>
<p><strong>ext. school grounds - day</strong>: It is the Phys Ed period
and the 31 other girls of 3A are lying on their backs in the quad doing
leg stretches to tinny music. MRS. ZWARTZ, the teacher, is patrolling
the rows of flexing bodies.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Can I have another look?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That’s so impressive!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’ve got scars . . . they’re on my
lungs.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I was in bed for months during the war,
ravaged by respiratory illness.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Mummy and Daddy sent me to the Bahamas to
recuperate. I didn’t see them for five years-but we’re together now and
Mummy’s promised they’ll never leave me again.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I spent ages in hospital, too . . . with my
leg. I had to have all these operations.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Osteomyelitus turns your bones to chalk. It
took them two years to drain all the muck out.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Cheer up! All the best people have bad
chests and bone diseases! It’s all frightfully romantic!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Hi, Paul!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: 0www!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: The evil Prince Runnymeade is escaping! Get
him, Paul!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: The blighter’s gone to ground!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: God! Jonty! Jonty-stop it! Go away! We’re
not playing anymore . . . go on, bugger off!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: 0h, God . . . I’m so sorry!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Of course it matters! It’s Mario!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Mother!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Jonty broke Paul’s record!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: We must buy her another one!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Which one shall we play?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Daddy can study while we’re playing
records!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Paul? Oh, God! Paul . . . are you all
right?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I think I’m dying . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Don’t . . . please! Please, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Paul!!!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Urrrgh! You’ve been eating onions.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: You toad!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: “There’s a light in her eye, Though she may
try to hide it, She cannot deny, There’s a light in her eye.”</p>
<p><strong>&amp; juliet</strong>: “Her face is a dream, like an angel I
saw . . .</p>
<p><strong>&amp; juliet</strong>: “But all that my darling can scream .
. .”</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I wish James would do a religious picture .
. . he’d be perfect as Jesus!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Daddy says the Bible’s a load of bunkum!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: But, we’re all going to Heaven!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’m not! I’m going to the Fourth World! It’s
like Heaven, only better because there aren’t any Christians.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: It’s an absolute Paradise of music, art and
enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: James will be there . . . and Mario! Only
they’ll be saints.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Saint Mario!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: To be known as He!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: He . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Him.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Him . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: This.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: This . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: That . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Absolutely not! Orson Welles! The most
hideous man alive!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: We give praise to . . . the saints!</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: “Christmas, 1952”</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Hope it’s all right. It’s from Whitcomb and
Tombs . . .</p>

laid with plates of sausage rolls and sandwiches. Pauline is laying
napkins out. STEVE Bayliss wanders in.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Pikelets! Yum!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Aren’t you going out?</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: Not till two-thirty . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: This is a private function! Go away!</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: retreats, hurt and confused. HONORA brings in
a plate of scones.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Come on! Sausage rolls.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Come on through.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting
out plates and cutlery.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Look who I’ve found!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet
into the dining room.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Hello, Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Rieper . . . it’s so nice to
meet you.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs
Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to
accept Charles’s proposal of marriage!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles
at Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: I’ve heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman’s
Session has lots of lively debate.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Well, actually, Mummy’s left that programme
now . . she’s far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: They sound like a queer mob!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Dad!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: I wouldn’t want my private business being
discussed with a complete stranger!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Oh, no . . . Mummy’s awfully good at it.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: She has deep discussions with unhappy
couples and persuades them to have another go at it. In two years, she’s
only had four divorces. She should really be working for the U.N.!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Mummy has a special technique called “Deep
Therapy.”</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’m not sure . . . but it’s proving to be
very popular!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: and HERBERT exchange a glance.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Eat up, Yvonne.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It’s my middle name.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: smiles at Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Yvonne tells us you’re good at making
models.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I adore anything to do with the arts.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: We’re pretty handy with model making, too,
eh?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: I’ve never cottoned on to Plasticine like
you girls, but I enjoy making things out of wood.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT
shakes his head.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: I work at Dennis Brothers Fish Supply.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: He’s the manager!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining
room.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: This is the dining room . . .</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Do excuse us.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Breakfast is between seven and nine . . .
the bedroom’s small, but it’s very clean and comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: This story of yours-maybe the school
newspaper will print it when it’s finished.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it’s a novel, and
we’ll be sending it to New York. That’s where all the big publishing
houses are based.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Is that a fact! You’d better put me name
down for an advance copy!</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: chuckles. Pauline and Juliet look at each
with knowing smiles.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We have decided how sad it is for other
people that they cannot appreciate our genius . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: . . . but we hope the book will help them
to do so a little, though no one could fully appreciate us.</p>
<p><strong>ext. wharf - daysuper</strong>: “Port Levy, Easter 1953”</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Charles clutches his wounded shoulder as he
gallops into the courtyard.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Deborah awaits his return in their private
boudoir at the very top of the tower.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: He smells her scent from 50 paces and urges
his steed onward!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: He flings open the door and launches
himself at the bed, ravishing her!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: God, yes!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I bet she gets up the duff on their first
night together!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Something you wouldn’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: You’re eight and a half and incredibly
stupid!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Mummy . . . Pauline and I have decided the
Charles and Deborah are going to have a baby. An heir to the throne of
Borovnia.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: We’re calling him Diello.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Paul thought it up.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Are you going abroad, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: You’re not going, are you, Mummy?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: But I should go, too!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: But- Hilda suddenly stands.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Julie! Julie!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Look, Paul!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: It’s so beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: What???</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Today Juliet and I discovered the key to
the Fourth World. We have had it in our possession for about six months,
but we only realised it on the day of the Death of Christ. We saw a
gateway through the clouds. Everything was full of peace and bliss. We
then realised we had the key . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We have an extra part of our brain which
can appreciate the Fourth World. Only about 10 people have it. On two
days every year we may use the key and look into that beautiful world
which we have been lucky enough to be allowed to know of . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: . . . on this Day of Finding the Key to the
Way through the Clouds.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Push! . . . Breathe! . . . It’s coming! . .
. Oh, God!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It’s a boy! Deborah . . . we’ve got a son
and heir!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I shall call him Diello.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: You’re such an incredible woman.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I couldn’t have done it without you,
Charles.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: . . . the Empress Deborah has the difficulty
fending off her husband, who tries his way with her morning, noon and
night . . .</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steve</strong>: NS Thank you, Juliet!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: . . . However, the Queen’s biggest problem
is her renegade child, Diello. He has proven to be an uncontrollable
little brighter, who slaughters his nannies whenever the fancy takes him
. . .</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steve</strong>: NS That’s enough, Juliet!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steve</strong>: NS I suppose this is your idea of a
joke?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: No, Mrs. STEVE ns.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steve</strong>: NS I suppose you think it’s witty and
clever to mock the Royal Family . . . to poke fun a the Empire, with
this . . . rubbish!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It’s not rubbish!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steve</strong>: NS Sit down, Pauline!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I really don’t understand why you are upset,
Mrs. STEVE n. I merely wrote an essay on the Royal Family as
requested.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It doesn’t say it has to be the
Windsors!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steve</strong>: NS Sit down!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steve</strong>: NS A girl like you should be setting an
example! To your seat!</p>
<p><strong>mrs. steve</strong>: NS Stop it, Juliet!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Mrs. Hulme told me they had found out today
that Juliet has tuberculosis on one lung. Poor Julietta. I nearly
fainted when I heard. I had a terrible job not to cry.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I spent a wretched night. It would be
wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and
eggs, tea and toast.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Come on, sit up.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I’m not hungry.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: You’ve got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly
touched our dinner. I’m not having you falling ill.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I just want to be on my own for a
while.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers
it to Pauline.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: You may have forgotten that you were once a
very sick little girl, but I haven’t!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly
takes it.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Do you think Juliet could stay here while
her parents are away?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Juliet’s infectious . . . she’ll be going to
hospital.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: But she’ll have no one to look after
her!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Her parents won’t be going overseas now . .
. they’ll have to cancel their trip. Don’t worry about Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Juliet won’t be allowed visitors for at
least a couple of months.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: I’ve booked you in for a chest X-ray . . .
just to be on the safe side.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline’s
plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Thought I’d have a go at building the
birdhouse on Saturday . . . anyone want to give me a hand?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: You used to love making things with Dad,
Yvonne.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: This evening I had a brainwave: that Juliet
and I should write to each other as Charles and Deborah.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I wrote a six-page letter as Charles and a
two-page letter as Paul.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: She has entered into the spirit of the
thing greatly!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: My dear Charles, I miss you and adore you in
equal amounts and long for the day we will be reunited, but as I
languish here, in this house of disease and decrepitude, my mind
turns-with increasing frequency- to the problem of our son . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Although only 10, Diello has thus far killed
57 people and shows no desire to stop . . . it worries me, Charles.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: My dearest darling Deborah. Affairs of
state continue to occupy my time.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I have to report that the lower classes are
terrifically dull.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Only yesterday I was compelled to execute
several peasants just to alleviate the boredom . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: . . . Diello insisted on coming along . . .
in fact, he made such a fuss that I had to let him yield the ax himself.
Heads did roll! Not just the prisoners, but the royal guard, my valet
and several unfortunate copped it as well . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Oh, Charles . . . I am despair enough to put
Diello in the hands of the Cardinal, in hope that a good dose of
religion will set the young chap on the right path.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Yvonne!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’m so happy to see you!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: hurries over.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: It’s best not to get too close. Juliet’s
still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We’ve bought you some
fruit.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Thank you so much!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: That’s coming along well!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’m the Matron’s favourite patient and she’s
shown me her special stitch!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I love the colour!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>int.juliet’s room - dayhonora</strong>: is looking at some
mail on a small table. Pauline is sitting at Juliet’s bedside.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Goodness me! What a lot of letters. Are your
parents enjoying their trip? Oh . . . there’s a couple of unopened ones,
dear.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’m saving them for a rainy day.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: gives her a sympathetic look.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: I know it’s hard for you being in here, but
it is for the good of your health.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: They sent me off to the Bahamas “for the
good of my health.” They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands “for the
good of my health.”</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: looks startled at the outburst.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’m sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I’m feeling quite
fatigued.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: We don’t want to tire you out, dear.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline
stands and Juliet grabs her hand.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Can’t you stay a bit longer, Paul?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: We’ve got a tram to catch, Yvonne.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Yes, but there’s nothing between them.
Deborah would never go for a commoner. Nicholas has got his eye on Gina,
an amazingly beautiful gypsy.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Juliet made it!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Oh, yes! It’s all worked out!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: You’ll never guess what’s happened!!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: What??</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: John has fallen in love with me!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That idiot boarder?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: How do you know? Did he tell you?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Well . . . no. But it’s so obvious.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Is that why you haven’t replied to my last
letter?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: No, silly. I’m just teasing. He’s only a
stupid boy!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Whaddya want?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Shut the door.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: You should have worn your slippers.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Just for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: To think that so much could happen in so
little time, caused by so few. A terrible tragedy has occurred . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: “Now, gels . . . it isn’t ooo, it’s eee,”
and she goes . . . “eeeeee” as if someone is jabbing a pin into her!
Silly old trout!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: And then in history, we’ve got this senile
old bat, who goes . . . “And Charles the Second met Nell Gwynn aboard a
boat and he was a prince and she was a pretty young thing and these
thing do happen . . .” God! It’s no wonder I don’t excel in history!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: 0f course, my darling Nicholas.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I like Nicholas much better!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Bloody hell!</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Go to the house.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: You have broken my heart, Yvonne.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: turns and leaves the room. Pauline stares
at the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I lay there mesmerised. It was just too
frightful to believe . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: When I got up I found Father had told
Mother . . .</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: shakes his head, sullenly.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: stands in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: John’s no longer staying here.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first,
but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary
lecture.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: From now on, you’re sleeping in the house,
where we can keep an eye on you.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: If you think for one minute that your father
and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you’ve got another thing
coming! You’re only 14!!! You’re a child! What on earth’s the matter
with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don’t you
have any self-respect?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: sighs.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Can I go now?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: grabs Pauline by the shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: You think you’re such a clever little madam!
You had your father in tears last night!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame
me, you shame the family. You’re nothing but a cheap little tart!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Well, I guess I take after you then!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: whirls around and slaps Pauline on the
cheek.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: You ran off with Dad when you were only 17!
Nana Parker told me!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: steps back.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: You’re going to be late.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: EXT. RIEPERS’ HOUSE - NIGHTMidnight at 31
Gloucester St. All lights are off.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I am terribly cut up. I miss Nicholas
terrifically. Mother thinks I will have nothing more to do with him, but
little she knows . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Nicholas was pleased that I was so
early.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We sat around and talked for an hour and
then went to bed. I declined the invitation at first, but he became very
masterful and I had no option. I discovered that I had not lost my
virginity on Thursday night. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that
I have now . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Charles!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Deborah!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Diello!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Deborah!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I’ve got to go home.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: There are living among two dutiful
daughters.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Of a man who possesses two beautiful
daughters,</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: You cannot know nor yet try to guess,/The
sweet soothingness of their caress,</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: The outstanding genius of this pair is
understood by few,/They are so rare. . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Mummy!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Compared with these two, every man is a
fool,/The world is most honoured that they should deign to rule,/And I
worship the power of these lovely two,/ With that adoring love known to
so few . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: ’Tis indeed a miracle, one must feel, That
two such heavenly creatures are real,</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Hatred burning bright in the brown eyes
with enemies for fuel,</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Icy scorn glitters in the gray eyes,
contemptuous and cruel, Why are men such fools they will not
realise,</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: The wisdom that is hidden behind those
strange eyes.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: And these wonderful people are you and
I.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: is standing, holding the door open, looking
rather surprised at the unexpected visitor.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Yes, of course.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: is pouring a drink.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Sure I can’t tempt you to a nice sherry,
Dr. Hulme?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Yvonne hasn’t been herself, either. Locking
herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: sits down next to Honora, glass of sherry
in hand.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: No arguments there, Dr. Hulme! All that
time inside working on those novels of theirs. They don’t get fresh air
or exercise!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: frowns at Henry.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: I’m not sure what you mean, Dr. Hulme.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: What’s she done???</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Answer Dr. Bennett, Yvonne.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Yvonne!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: leaves the room.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: She nags me.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: They’re silly.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: looks up from her chair.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: bustles in, and Dr. Bennett closes the door.
Pauline sits down, folds her arms and stares blankly at a COUPLE OF SICK
PATIENTS.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: looks horrified.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: But she’s always been such a normal, happy
child.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: But what about the vomiting? She’s lost a
lot of weight . . .</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Oh . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Mother woke me this morning and started
lecturing me before I was properly awake, which I thought was somewhat
unfair. She has brought up the worst possible threat now. She said that
if my health did not prove I could never see the Hulmes again. The
thought is too dreadful. Life would be unbearable without Deborah . .
.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: l wish I could die. This is not an idle or
temporary impulse. I have decided over the last two or three weeks that
it would be the best thing that could happen together, and the thought
of death is not fearsome.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: waves a pair of new socks around. The
family laughing and talking. Pauline is not participating. She is
leaning back, looking morose. HONORA looks at her with concern.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Is it hurting, dear?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Your leg . . . have you got pain?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: My New Year’s resolution is a far more
selfish one than last year, so there is more probability of my keeping
it. It is to make my motto: “Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow you
may be dead.”</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: walks in, waving a letter.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: This arrived today, Yvonne . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: My name is Gina!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: It’s a letter from the school . . . from
Miss Stewart.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: What does old Stew want?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: She says the standard of your work is
slipping. At this rate she doesn’t think you’ll get School
Certificate.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Who cares!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: I care . . . your father cares . . . we want
you to have a good education.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I’m educating myself!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: You’re failing English . . . you used to be
top of the class- PAULINE I’m doing my own writing!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: snatches up an exercise book from a large
pile.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: These stories are not going to get you
School Certificate! You don’t seriously think anyone’s going to publish
them?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: What do you know? You wouldn’t know the
first thing about writing. You’re the most ignorant person I’ve ever
met!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: is very angry.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: You’re rude . . . rude and insolent! I don’t
see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute
longer.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I don’t wanna be in bloody school!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: All right! You go out there and get a job
and you damn well pay your own way!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: storms out of the room and slams the
door.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I think I’m going crazy.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: No, you’re not, Gina-it’s everybody else who
is bonkers!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Let’s go overseas . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: You mean travel by ourselves?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Where shall we go? Not the Bahamas; it’s
bloody awful!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Of course! It’s so obvious!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I know . . . I’ll lean back and put my hair
on my shoulders-then I’ll look just like Veronica Lake!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Stay still or they’ll be blurry . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Hurry up! I’m freezing!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Just a couple more . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I know, I’ll lean forward and show more
cleavage!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I’m sure they’ll notice things missing.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: They’ll blame the bloody housekeeper. She
nicks stuff all the times!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: This lot’s got to be worth 50 quid!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I can try my father’s safe. I’m sure I can
get the keys to his office.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That’s great! We’ll have the fare in no
time!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I rose at 5:30 this morning and did
housework before 8 o’clock, including taking Wendy her breakfast in bed.
I feel very pleased with myself on the whole and also the future.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We are so brilliantly clever.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: “Two Weeks Later”</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Direct hit! Gave his trousers a good
soaking! Everyone will think he’s peed himself!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Bloody Bill’s sniffing around Mummy
something chronic.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I thought he was supposed to be terribly
ill.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That was what we were led to believe . .
.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I was looking forward to the ambulance
arriving . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: There’s something desperately exciting about
bodies on stretchers . . . But it wasn’t like that at all!</p>
<p><strong>same scene - but</strong>: No ambulance or stretchers . . .
Walter hops out of a cab, looking fit and healthy. Hilda steps out of
the house, followed by Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>cut to</strong>: EXT. ILAM GROUNDS - DAY Pauline and Juliet
are finishing their grapes as they watch Hilda and Walter on the tennis
court.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Poor Mother was completely taken in.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Do you think Bloody Bill’s trying to get
into her draws?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Too right . . . but he doesn’t have a show!
Nobody gets into Mother’s draws except Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Poor Father . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Don’t worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each
other.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Just washing my hair now, Laurie. Won’t be
a moment.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: is walking past with an armful of
washing.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Is she still in there?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Pauline . . . Come on, you’ve had enough
time.</p>
<p><strong>int. riepers’ house/corridor - nighthonora</strong>: knocks
harder.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Yes, yes, yes!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: You open up this door right now!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I’m bloody dressing as fast as I can, for
God’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Open this door!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Mother gave me a fearful along the usual
strain.</p>
<p><strong>close up . . . honora</strong>: talking to Pauline,
soundlessly.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I rang Deborah immediately as I had to tell
someone sympathetic how I loathed Mother.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: “23rd April 1954”</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: The balloon has gone up!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Don’t try and fob me off! It’s going to cost
you a hundred pounds, or I’m blabbing to Daddy!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I don’t care what you do! Pauline and I are
going to Hollywood. They’re desperately keen to sign us up. We’re going
to be film stars!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: It’s all arranged . . . we don’t need your
bloody hundred pounds anyway, so stick it up your bottom!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Deborah told me the stupendous news! I’m
going out to Ilam as we have much to talk over.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Deborah was still in bed when I
arrived.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Dr. Hulme asked us to come into the lounge
to have a talk with him.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: The shock is too great to have penetrated
my mind. It is so incredible. Poor Father. Dr. Hulme was absolutely kind
and understanding . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: He said we must tell him everything about
our going to America. He was both hope-giving and depressing. We talked
for a long time and Deborah and I were near tears by the time it was
over.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: What is to be the future now? We may all be
going to Italy and dozens of other places, or not all. We none of us
know where we are and a good deal depends on chance.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Dr. Hulme is the noblest and most wonderful
person I have ever known of.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: One thing Deborah and I are sticking to:
through everything, we sink or swim together.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: But Daddy, you can’t just leave me with
Mother!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Is Gina coming, too?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’m not going to England without Gina!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: The Hulmes will look after me. They want me
to live with them!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Don’t be so ridiculous. You’re our daughter,
you belong here with us.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I belong with Deborah! We’re going to South
Africa!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: You’re not going anywhere. You’re 15 years
old!!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: You have to let me go!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: stands and walks toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: We’ll talk about this when you’ve calmed
down.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: pauses at the door. Pauline is slowly
rocking on the bed, staring at the wall.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite
seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth
the living, death such an easy way out.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Love, you can still write to each other.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: softly touches Pauline’s cheek. Pauline
winces, averting her face.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Anger against Mother boiled up inside me as
it is she who is one of the main obstacle in my path. Suddenly a means
of ridding myself of this obstacle occurred to me. If she were to die .
. .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Everything’s going to be okay, Gina.
Mr. Perry’s promised to give me 50 pounds for my horse . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: That’s a hundred and twenty! It’s another 30
pounds and we’ve got the fare!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It’s no bloody good . . . I went to the
passport office today. They won’t give me one till I’m 20.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: But that’s not true! I’ve got one.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I need my sodding parents’ consent.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Don’t cry, Gina . . . We’re not going to be
separated. They can’t make us . . . they can’t!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Yvonne.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Please don’t be like this, love.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I did not tell Deborah of my plans for
removing Mother. I have made no decision yet as the last fate I wish to
meet is one in a borstal. I am trying to think of some way.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: is chopping firewood in the back garden.
HONORA approaches him.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: I’ve just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: What now?</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: She says Juliet’s in a terrible state . .
.</p>
<p><strong>int. riepers’ house/lounge - dayhonora</strong>: and HERBERT
are sitting with Hilda in the lounge.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: and HONORA exchange a glance.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: shakes her head.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Yvonne hasn’t spoken to me for nearly two
weeks.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: She’s cut us out of her life . . . it’s
been causing her mother and I a lot of worry.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Is that a good idea?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: looks at HONORA . . . tears are running
down her cheeks. He stands and ushers Hilda toward the door.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Why don’t I telephone you tonight,
Mrs. Hulme?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: accompanies Hilda into the hallway.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: breaks down into heavy sobs.</p>
<p><strong>super</strong>: “11th June 1954”</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We realised why Deborah and I have such
extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way
they do. It is because we are MAD. We are both stark raving MAD!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Dr. Hulme is MAD, as MAD as a March
hare!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It was the first time I had ever seen It.
Deborah had always told me how hideous he was!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It is appalling. He is dreadful. I have
never in my life seen anything in the same category of hideousness . . .
but I adore him!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We talked for some time about It, getting
ourselves more and more excited.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We enacted how each saint would make love
in bed.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We spent a hectic night going through the
saints. It was wonderful! Heavenly! Beautiful! And ours! We felt
satisfied indeed. We have now learned the peace of the thing called
Bliss, the joy of the thing called Sin.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I’m coming with you.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Yes . . .</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I know what to do about mother.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We don’t want to go to too much trouble . .
. some sort of accident.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: People die every day.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Our main idea for the day was to moider
mother.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: This notion is not a new one but this time
it is a definite plan which we intend to carry out. We have worked it
out carefully and are both thrilled by the idea. Naturally we feel a
trifle nervous, but the pleasure of anticipation is great.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Only the best people fight against all
obstacles . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: . . . in pursuit of happiness.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: We both spent last night having a simply
wonderful time in every possible way.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I was picked up at 2:00 P.M. I have been
very sweet and good. I have worked out a little more of our plan.
Peculiarly enough I have no qualms of conscience.</p>
<p><strong>int. riepers’ house - dayhonora</strong>: is bustling about
the house, working. Every time she bends down, or leans over, Pauline is
revealed behind her. She is helping, but the mood is one of a hunter
closing in on its prey.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I rose late and helped Mother vigorously
this morning. Deborah rang and we decided to use a rock in a stocking
rather than a sandbag. We discussed the moider fully. I feel very keyed
up as though I were planning a surprise party. Mother has fallen in with
everything beautifully and the happy event is to take place tomorrow
afternoon. So next time I write in this diary Mother will be dead. How
odd-yet how pleasing.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Mummy!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Mummy!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I am writing a little of this up on the
morning before the death. I felt very excited and the
night-before-Christmas-ish last night. I am about to rise.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Mummy!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I will . . . I’m so looking forward to
it!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Bye, Daddy . . . see you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>int. riepers’ house/kitchen - morninghonora</strong>: is
mixing up some pikelet batter. Pauline is buttering bread . . . a great
pile.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Whoa . . . there s enough there to feed an
army!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her
jacket.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Oh-what a nice outfit!</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Thank you. I bought it especially,
Mrs. Rieper.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage
rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: turns around and Juliet presents her with a
brown paper bag.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Fruit.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Oh! I’ll pop them in a bowl.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: picks up the satchel. Pauline and Juliet
tense up . . . as HONORA puts the satchel on a chair.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Let’s go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the
last 10 pages of my opera last night.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: All right, then.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Do you feel sweaty? I feel sweaty.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It’s a three-act story with a tragic
end.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Your mother is a rather miserable woman . .
. isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I thought for hours about whether Carmelita
should accept Bernard’s marriage proposal . . .</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I think she knows what’s going to happen . .
. she doesn’t appear to bear us any grudge!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: . . . but in the end I decided against it.
I thought it would spoil all their fun.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Affairs are much more exciting than
marriages . . . as Mummy can testify!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: It’s true! He was spotted in the lingerie
department, eh, Wendy?</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I bet it was thermal underwear!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of
their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: That’s enough, Yvonne!</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: That man’s a credit to the nation.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Right . . . who’s going to help me clear
away?</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: I’d better be getting back. Bye, love.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: pulls his coat on. HONORA gives him a peck
cheek.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Have a nice outing, you lot.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Bye, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: wanders out. HONORA turns to Pauline and
Juliet.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Well . . . I better make myself a bit more
presentable.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: is sitting at the back with Pauline and
Juliet bus winds its way toward the Cashmere Hills.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: Isn’t it beautiful!</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Let’s go for a walk down here . . . come
on, Mummy!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: spots a tea kiosk.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: I’d like a cuppa tea first! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: heads toward the kiosk.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: You have it.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Oh, no. I’m watching my figure.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: But you’re not fat, Mrs. Rieper!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Go on, Mum, treat yourself.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Yvonne, love, we should be going back . . .
we don’t want to miss the bus.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: turns around.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Juliet . . . button up your coat, dear.
You’ll get a chill.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: Look, Mother!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: looks down at the ground in front of
her.</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: falls to her knees . . . raising a hand to
her head . . . starts to turn . . .</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: falls to the ground . . . blood trickling
down her face. She’s panting heavily.</p>
<p><strong>high angle . . . honora</strong>: looking up at Juliet, her
face imploring.</p>
<p><strong>juliet</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pauline</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>honora</strong>: Parker: Sarah Peirse</p>
<p><strong>herbert</strong>: Rieper: Simon O’Connor</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: Yes, yes. And I also got my hands on a novel
called Obsession, which I read when I was about 14. I thought at the
time that it was extremely good. It takes a very damning view of the
girls-it’s written by two English journalists who came out here to cover
the trial. It was something of a hack job that set out to sensationalize
the case.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: Yeah, there’s been a play, and there have been
nonfiction books written about it. There’s also been a great deal of
coverage over the years in newspapers and magazines, so it’s always had
a profile here.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Well, the structure was fairly apparent once we
started to do research. It wasn’t just the diaries themselves, it was
the general research. We read as much of the diaries as we could-we
haven’t actually ever seen the full, unedited diary-but we gathered as
many of the excerpts that were releasedat the time of the trial as we
could, which amounted to quite a few pages. And we read the newspapers,
and interviewed people, and then the three acts sort of materialized
quite neatly. You know, act one is when the two girls meet and become
friends, and the turning point is at the end of the first act when you
realize that they are now bonded.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: It’s when they have their first delusional
experience together at Port Levy, where they go into the Fourth World.
You know these two girls have an imagination that’s going to lead to
something interesting happening. The second turning point comes with the
decision to murder Mother, which tips</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Well, we went through about 35 or 40 people. We
wanted to interview as many people as we could find. Several refused. We
talk to about 15 or 16 of their classmates, which was experience. These
were 55-year-old women spread out around the country, and they all had
changed their names because they’d gotten married. It was quite a
detective job to find them.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: No, the school didn’t want anything to do with
it. Christchurch Girls’ School had erased these two girls from their
history. The yearbook that had the class photograph with Pauline is no
longer available. If you go to the school library, they have all the
yearbooks available apart from 1953’s, which has her photo in it. It
sort of cleansing of the books. The school didn’t recognize what it was
we were trying to do, which was to redress the issue. Why wipe these
girls off the school records? I mean, they were human beings.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: Peter and Jim Booth, the producer of the movie,
went to see the headmistress of the school, and after they explained
what we wanted to do, and allowed her to read the script, her only
comment was, “Why can’t you make a film about pupils of whom we are
proud?”</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: We also heard from several sources we
interviewed that on the day after the murder happened, the headmistress
at the time stood up in front of the assembly and said, “No girl is to
discuss a certain matter.” This was, like, the day after two of their
pupils had murdered somebody, and they couldn’t even refer to it
directly. Forty years later, we got the sense that the school was
exactly the same. And that really gave us all the more reason to make
the movie, because we felt that these people were still</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: Well, all you can do is attempt to find out as
much as you can about the people involve-the type of people they were,
their class background, etc. So to that degree, we spoke to people who
knew the Riepers, for example, who had good knowledge of the girls.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Yeah, I did, very briefly. We found one of the
boarders, who spoke to me on the telephone. I did the interview, and
then the following day I called him back to ask him some more questions
and he clammed up; he didn’t want to talk to me anymore. He’d obviously
gone home to his wife, and she’d</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: I think our understanding when we set out to
write this was that we would never be able to re-create the right
interiors, with characters who precisely reflect the people who were
really there. Our intention was to be true to what we understood of the
girls’ friendship, and the nature of that</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: The Hulme family were a lot easier to research
than Pauline’s family, because the Hulmes were public figures at the
time. Henry Hulme being the rector of the local university, there were
obviously a lot of university people we could talk to professors,
students-who worked with him. Hilda Hulme was also quite a public
figure. They were, in some respects, the royalty of Christchurch,
because the English class system was and still does exist down there,
and they all take these things quite seriously.There used to be garden
and tennis parties at Ilam, and there were a lot of people who had
social contact with the parents and Juliet at the time.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: To an extent, but not as much as what we had
hoped. Pauline’s people were actually quite difficult to research,
because they just weren’t public; they were quite private people.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: We have heard, subsequently, that Pauline’s
sister, Wendy, has seen the film. She still lives in Christchurch. Her
con meets were that the film managed to capture the atmosphere of her
home at that time, but her criticism was that the family was “better”
than that, we had portrayed them in too shabby a light. And that really
touched me.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: She thought that the portrayal of the tension
between Pauline and her mother was very accurate. It was nice, because
Wendy is one of the few key people alive who refuses to talk about it.
She absolutely refuses to have anything to do with journalists, with
anyone, so it was actually very sweet of her to get the message back to
us. It was quite amazing to us that she had even gone to see this film.
She thought it was good, but incredibly difficult to watch.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: There was one area we deliberately steered clear
of that we felt ultimately didn’t have a relation to what we were
wanting to tell, and that was that in the Rieper household there was
actually a younger sister, named Rosemary, who had Down’s syndrome, who
is still alive; Wendy still looks after her. At the time of the murder,
Rosemary was only 8 years old. This made Honora’s life all the more
difficult: the daughter lived in a special home, and would come home on
the weekends. Pauline writes about Rosemary a lot in her diaries; she
was very fond of her. But it was one area where we felt that we were
being too invasive into the privacy of this family.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: That was out of our imagination. We were told
that they were extremely jolly at that last meal-it was actually in the
court records-and that they were cracking jokes, and saying silly,
outrageous things, on a sort of giggly high. And we knew that Wendy had
worked at Farmer’s, the localdepartment store, and also what had been
very big in the news that year was Sir Edmund Hillary, a New Zealander,
climbing Mt. Everest. He had been knighted, and became a huge national
hero; he still is. Because he’d also spent time in Christchurch, we felt
that this was an appropriate thing for</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: I think from the beginning. That was one of the
motivations for doing it. None of the accounts we came across were from
the girls’ point of view. Like we’d said before, they all had other
agendas, so we felt that telling the girls’ story was important. It did
take us a long time to be able to do that, because it took us a long
time to learn who they were, and what was driving them. We were a bit
confused-there was a bit of mystery at the beginning-but the more we
read, the more we talked to people, we gradually began to formulate who
these people were. Ultimately, there was a lot of Pauline that I could
recognize in myself, which was very useful.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: I felt that the diary: offered the first insight
into the friendship, and into Pauline in particular. It was an extremely
interesting account of her life, documenting both dramatic and mundane
events with a great deal of literary flair. She was a very imaginative,
funny and clever young woman who had some quite pretentious ideas, as
teenagers do, and I warmed toward her immediately. Reading the diary
made me wonder about the huge discrepancies between this young woman and
the monster who was portrayed in the newspaper accounts and everything
else. And I thought it would be great to take that journey to find out
who she was. Because no diary of Juliet’s survived-we have heard from
people that she did keep a diary, but it was destroyed-I thought it
would be harder to get to know her, but that really wasn’t the case,
because she appeared to be someone who more readily shared her life with
people; she was much more of a social creature than Pauline. So it was a
combination of the private world that they shared and the understanding
that we got from talking to their school friends, inparticular, that
gave us insight into the nature of these two girls and the way they
appeared to the rest of the world.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: In this particular screenplay, camera movement
came quite readily during the writing stages. At the end of the day, the
script is not the document we want to go out and sell; it’s the document
that the cast and crew have to read. When we write a script intended for
me to direct, it’s right from the beginning a shooting script; a
document for technicians to use. You know, the grips put a circle around
the word “DOLLY” so they remember on that particular day of shooting
they’re going to have to have it on the truck. With this movie, probably
more than any other I’ve done, the camera moves were integral to the
scriptwriting. I’ll tell you where that came from: the music. We read
very early in our research that Pauline and Juliet were both obsessed
with Mario Lanza. Neither of us were familiar with his music, so we went
out and got some of his records, and before we started writing we played
through them and came across several songs that we really liked. One of
the very first ones we heard was “The Donkey</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: When we heard it, just the life and vitality in
the song immediately indicated Steadicam. It immediately told you you
had to have a moving camera. We chose all the songs that were in the
movie, and, in the case of “The Donkey Serenade,” wrote scenes around
them. I found it a great visual tool. It’s never happened before in
anything I’ve done-I mean, I’ve never had the music in advance. We had
these songs playing while we were working to get ourselves psyched up to
write a scene. At the same time, the music helped me visualize, so that
visualization ended up going down on the page. Of course, once you
actually arrive on the set, and you have the actors and the camera
people there, things can change. I don’t regard anything that’s written
into a script in terms of a camera direction asbeing locked in
stone.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Not really long. I think the first draft was
written in probably 10 or 12 weeks. But we didn’t start to write until
we’d uncovered several months’ worth of research.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Yeah. I think that’s about draft number five. We
did an interesting thing. We did a certain amount of research first,
while we were still working on Braindead , and then we wrote the
first</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Well, it depends. You know, if Fran’s working on
some re-writes while we’re shooting, and I’m on the set, she’ll show me
some work that she’s done when I come home and we’ll revise it together,
but generally, when we’re actually writing the initial drafts of the
script, it’s always together.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Well, it was late one night, and we were hoping
to finish the first draft of the script-it was, like, ten o’clock
already-and we had arrived at the sequence in the tearooms where they’re
having their last cup of tea before they walk down the track. We sat
there wondering how on earth we were going to write this scene. We knew
they’d actually gone there to have tea because we’d spoken to this very
elderly woman who had served them. She said they were talking quite
calmly to one another. But what dialogue do you put in their mouths at
this particular moment, when this woman’s about to be murdered? Well,
the phone rang, and I got up to answer it and ended up stuck on this
call for about 45 minutes, and I came back and Fran had written
something. She asked me to check it out, and it was never revised: it’s
where she slides the plate with the last cake over to Honora, and says,
“Go on, Mother, treat yourself.” It was perfect.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Well, it’s one of those stories that sounds like
it’s not true. We wanted to cast someone in New Zealand, and we’d
auditioned a lot of people-five or six hundred-who were either
videotaped or photographed. I wanted to find someone who was young,
around 1S or 16 years old; I didn’t want a 23-year-old in a school
uniform. And we wanted someone who was physically very much like the
original Pauline; I have a thing about being as accurate as possible. So
we quickly exhausted the professional actors in New Zealand who happened
to look like Pauline-there’s only about one or two. We knew we were
looking for someone with no experience, but we just had to find them. We
kept saying, “Somewhere in New Zealand there’s somebody who’s perfect
for this role.”We were actually about four weeks away from beginning
shooting, and we had one or two people on the short list, neither of
whom we were happy with, but we were coming under enormous pressure to
cast one of them, because, you know, the wardrobe department needed to
make costumes, and so</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: We were in a rusting Ford Cortina, and we had no
official I.D. We’d roll up to these provincial schools, and we’d be
greeted by some curious teacher. Although no one ever once questioned
our authenticity, we would always get asked about the car: “If you’re in
films, why aren’t you driving</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: I guess that went on for about a week. Every
night I’d get a call from Fran. Anyone that was vaguely appropriate was
videotaped, and I got a couple of tapes in Christchurch, and it was a
bit depressing. Finally, Fran called from a small town called New
Plymouth, and said, “I think I’ve found someone very interesting. ’ And
this was Mel. We flew her down to Christchurch and gave her an audition
and a screen test, and we cast her two weeks before the film started
shooting. I called her mother up on a Friday night and said,”I’d really
like Melanie to do the film.” And she said, “When does she have to
start?” And I said, “Well, she’s got to come down here on Sunday.” The
poor girl didn’t even get a chance to go back to school to clean out her
locker.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: One of the things that we knew about Pauline was
that she was incredibly witty and intelligent, and Melanie was very
similar-she was the top student in her province in many subjects. And we
knew if we cast an intelligent person, then they were going to hit it.
Melanie’s also very enigmatic. The character of Pauline doesn’t have an
enormous amount of dialogue. In a sense, the real Pauline Parker speaks
for her, through the diaries. So what we were looking for was an actress
who has that kind of aspect to her that’s a real movie-star thing: where
you can film somebody sitting in a room, doing nothing, and they’re
still fascinating to watch. We found that in Mel.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: As much as we could. The only location we
couldn’t use was Pauline’s house, which had been torn down. Fortunately,
the school is now a community center; the actual school moved to a
different location, so they no longer had control over the buildings;
otherwise we’d have definitely been refused</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Well, we went to the murder site, and we just
felt uncomfortable about filming there. It was very strange, and maybe
it was just our imagination, but it was very quiet, very tranquil. I
mean, all the way down the path you hear the wind and the birds, and
suddenly, when you arrive at the spot, you hear nothing. So we filmed
the murder scene at Victoria Park, but it was on a different track,
about a hundred yards away.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Well, that sequence was actually shot, and
exists in the version of the film that was screened here in New Zealand.
When Miramax released the film in the U.S., they had screenings and felt
that the film was too long. We had final control over the film, but they
pleaded with us to take out about 10 minutes’ worth of footage,
convinced that it would be tighter. We looked at it, and we actually,
ultimately, agreed with them in a funny sort of way. That sequence slows
the momentum down. It’s quite a fun one to</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: I think when we wrote the script we felt it was
very much Pauline and Juliet’s story. After the edit, however, it became
very evident to us that it was Pauline’s story which was the through
line and the audience’s focal point. Whenever we veered too much into
telling the Hulme story and Pauline wasn’t on the screen, the pace
started to flag. That was something we had to look at after the first
assembly-we had to trim and cut Hulme scenes because they weren’t as
fundamentally interesting as the Rieper scenes.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Well, the script for Braindead was set in the
modern day up until the very last minute. I was worried going into the
movie that the hero of the film, named Lionel, acted in a fairly nerdy
kind of way-he doesn’t socialize, he takes care of his mother-and yet we
wanted him to be the empathetic character in the film. I was afraid that
if it was set in the modern day, the audience-especially a young
audience-would really jeer at this character, and not be able to relate
to him at all. If we set it inthe ’50s, people might actually feel more
sympathy for him, because they would think, “Well, that sort of thing
happened then.” With Heavenly Creatures, it was really just a
coincidence that the actual event had taken place then.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: But that repression is still very much in
evidence here: we’re I not expressive, we’re not demonstrative, we’re
scared of showing, saying too much. When you go to New York, for
instance, and people are yelling and the horns are blaring-if that
happened here, someone would get out of theircar, rip open your door and
bash you up. There’s a level of violence, a subtext of violence, running
through New Zealand society that comes out in our movies. We have a
veneer of being easygoing, but underneath, we’re full of rage. It’s an
interesting social dynamic. and it makes for interesting art, but it’s
not so pleasant to actually live in it. It’s very much to do with a link
with England- PJ: Christchurch in particular.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: Christchurch suffers from it more than any other
city in New Zealand. It’s always been described as “a little piece
England”; it’s considered to be more English than England. It’s always
aspired to be that, and it still is in some ways.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: The thing with this murder, too, is that the
sense you when you talk to the older generation in Christchurch is that
it was an embarrassment to the city, that it was somehow shameful and
somehow humiliating. Which is ridiculous, because the story is
ultimately a family tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: It’s been said that Christchurch was more
appalled by revelation that Pauline’s parents were not married than by
the murder itself. And some uncharitable souls even suggested that one
sinful act led on to the other.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Well, I like movies to be entertaining, to be a
little larger than life. With something like Braindead, obviously
there’s no problem doing that. But with ‘Heavenly Creatures,’ we were
telling what we hoped would be a fairly accurate story. At the same
time, however, I still wanted to make a movie; I didn’t want something
totally tied to real life, and totally dull. So we did have a little bit
of fun with some of those characters. I guess if you were trying to
justify it you could say we were presenting them from the girls’ point
of view, but that’s not strictly true. I just think that there were
really only two people who we needed to be realistic with, and they were
Juliet and Pauline, both of whom were slightly larger than life anyway.
That’s something that came across in the interviews with their
classmates. They were remembered as being sort of terrifying: Juliet was
so confident and loud, and Pauline was brooding and dark. So, in a
sense, the film was a perfect one for us. I don’t Like doing stuff
that’s totally naturalistic. I just like having a little bit of fun.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Pretty much. We hadn’t used any optical or
digital effects in Braindead, and with Heavenly Creatures, I knew that
if I actually wrote digital effects into the script, then it was a great
excuse to go out and get this new equipment-I have my own special
effects company. So right at the beginning we wrote stuff that could
only be done with morphing. We got one computer and hired someone to
figure out how it all worked.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Yeah, we interviewed several people who
remembered that they used to model figures in Plasticine, and I think
HERBERT Rieper refers to it in his court testimony. We also interviewed
an old guy who had been round to the Hulme’s place and had seen Juliet’s
Plasticine horses on the mantelpiece.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Well, that was something that we devised
ourselves. But again, that springs from the fact that the girls used to
give pet names to people. Like one of the boarders in the diary, for
instance, is referred to as John for a while, and then his name changed
to Nicholas.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: Yeah, and for some reason, Pauline refers to him
as Nicholas in the rest of her diary. That happened with a lot of
people. They were clearly using real, live people as prototypes for some
of their fantasy characters. We figured that Diello had a lot of
qualities that they seemed to fear in Orson Welles. He seemed to
represent some sort of dark, sexual force, so we figured that giving his
features to the figure of Diello was appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: Well, where do you start? We knew that would be
a possible outcome of making this film-that someone might try and track
down either Pauline or Juliet. Which was a very good reason not to make
the movie. We had more compelling reasons to make the film, however,
because if we didn’t, anotherone was going to get made anyway. There
were, at the time the film was being funded, five competing projects in
various states of preparation.</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: His company, Punch Productions, I believe, had a
script written by an American writer; Peter had, in fact, been very
tentatively approached to read it, that was how we found out about it.
At that point we were about a week away from starting to shoot. And then
someone was trying to do a film version of the play we’ve already spoken
of, and other people were developing a very politicized lesbian version
of the story. Then there’d been a screenplay written by the late English
novelist, Angela Carter, that was with a production company in Auckland,
and there was someone in Australia developing a screenplay. So we knew
that this story was going to come to the screen, soon-there was no doubt
someone was going to make it. And we felt that, in that climate, we
would proceed, despite the possibility that these women might be
exposed.We knew that in Pauline’s case it was less likely. We’d heard a
lot of rumor and gossip about Juliet, but we’d heard nothing about
Pauline, and I think she has very carefully hidden her identity. Juliet
went to no such trouble: she took her stepfather’s name-Hilda Hulme
ended up marrying Walter Perry-as a novelist, and proceeded to write a
series of crime novels. You can look up any contemporary author index in
any library, and there is Anne Perry, and her birthdate is the same as
Juliet Hulme’s, her mother’s maiden name is the same, etc. There is a
gap in her personal history, where she leaves out New Zealand, but it
picks up again after she left the country. So it didn’t take a huge
amount of detective work from the journalist here in New Zealand who had
heard that Anne Perry and JulietHulme were one and the same.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: I mean, we were absolutely disgusted by some of
the ads Miramax ran. On the day that this was released in America, I
rang Miramax and said, “For heaven’s sake, don’t associate this film
with any of this because we don’t approve of this publicity.” And a
couple of months later, lo and behold, we</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: No, because the case is so well-known in New
Zealand; it would be like-</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: Fictionalizing the O.J. Simpson case.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: It’s unnecessary. I mean, sure, if it was just a
movie for international consumption, then, yeah. But the fact is that we
weren’t actually making this film for an international audience. We were
very much</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: Well, we looked at movies like Let Him Have It,
which was based on the Craig/Bentley murder case in England . Although I
think that film has quite a lot of merit, in the end it comes across as
a grim, dark, true-life murder</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: We wanted to make it a lot funnier than those
films. And people have said, “It’s such a serious subject; why did you
try to make it funny?” Well, obviously the murder wasn’t funny, and we
never attempted to make it funny, but the friendship was funny. Life is
funny: generally, human beings</p>
<p><strong>fw</strong>: But the other reason why it was important that
we tell this as a true story is that it has a kind of universal truth
for anybody growing up. When you’re at that age, you become very focused
on things in an extreme way. And I don’t think Pauline and Juliet are so
very different from anybody else; I think several things went wrong in
their lives-Juliet’s parents broke up, and Pauline became very alienated
from her family -and I think it was this terriblecombination of things
that led to this extraordinarily horrible act. But it’s not something
that can be precluded from anybody’s experience in growing up.
Adolescence is such a crazy time.</p>
<p><strong>pj</strong>: A lot of women have come up to us and said, “I
was Pauline. That was me. That was my childhood.” I don’t think it’s
that unusual. I think what is unusual about the whole thing is that
these aspects of Pauline’s character led to the murder, and I don’t
think the sort of person she was was particularly unusual or freakish or
weird. When we hear things like that, it’s the best possible endorsement
we could get.</p>
