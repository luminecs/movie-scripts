<h1 id="notting-hill">notting-hill</h1>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Of course, I’ve seen her films and always
thought she was, well, fabulous – but, you know, million miles from the
world I live in. Which is here – Notting Hill – not a bad place to
be…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: There’s the market on weekdays, selling
every fruit and vegetable known to man…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: The tattoo parlour – with a guy outside who
got drunk and now can’t remember why he chose ‘I Love Ken’…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: The racial hair-dressers where everyone
comes out looking like the Cookie Monster, whether they like it or
not…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Then suddenly it’s the weekend, and from
break of day, hundreds of stalls appears out of nowhere, filling
Portobello Road right up to Notting Hill Gate…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: … and thousands of people buy millions of
antiques, some genuine…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: … and some not so genuine.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: And what’s great is that lots of friends
have ended up in this part of London – that’s Tony, architect turned
chef, who recently invested all the money he ever earned in a new
restaurant…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: So this is where I spend my days and years
– in this small village in the middle of a city – in a house with a blue
door that my wife and I bought together… before she left me for a man
who looked like Harrison Ford, only even handsomer…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: … and where I now lead a strange half-life
with a lodger called…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Spike!</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Even he. Hey, you couldn’t help me with an
incredibly important decision, could you?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: This is important in comparison to, let’s
say, whether they should cancel third world debt?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: That’s right – I’m at last going out on a
date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I’ve picked the
right t-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: What are the choices?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Well… wait for it… First there’s this
one…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes – might make it hard to strike a really
romantic note.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Point taken.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: I suspect you’ll prefer the next one.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Cool, huh?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes – she might think you don’t have true
love on your mind.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Wouldn’t want that… Okay – just one more.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, yes, that’s perfect. Well done.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Thanks. Great. Wish me luck.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: And so it was just another hopeless
Wednesday, as I set off through the market to work, little suspecting
that this was the day which would change my life forever. This is work,
by the way, my little travel book shop…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: … which, well, sells travel books – and, to
be frank with you, doesn’t always sell many of those.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Classic. Absolutely classic. Profit from
major sales push – minus $B!r</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Shall I go get a cappuccino? Ease the
pain.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes, better get me a half. All I can
afford.</p>
<p><strong>marin</strong>: I get your logic. Demi-capu coming up.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, thanks. I’ll just look around.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That book’s really not good – just in case,
you know, browsing turned to buying. You’d be wasting your money.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes. This one though is… very good.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I think the man who wrote it has actually
been to Turkey, which helps. There’s also a very amusing incident with a
kebab.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thanks. I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: If you could just give me a second.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Bad news.</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: We’ve got a security camera in this bit of
the shop.</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: So, I saw you put that book down your
trousers.</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: What book?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: The one down your trousers.</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: I haven’t got a book down my trousers.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right – well, then we have something of an
impasse. I tell you what – I’ll call the police – and, what can I say? –
If I’m wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really
apologize.</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Okay – what if I did have a book down my
trousers?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, ideally, when I went back to the
desk, you’d remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and
either wipe it and put it back, or buy it. See you in a sec.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Sorry about that…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, that’s fine. I was going to steal one
myself but now I’ve changed my mind. Signed by the author, I see.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes, we couldn’t stop him. If you can find
an unsigned copy, it’s worth an absolute fortune.</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Can I have your autograph?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Rufus.</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: What does it say?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, that’s the signature – and above, it
says ‘Dear Rufus – you belong in jail.’</p>
<p><strong>thief</strong>: Nice one. Would you like my phone number?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Tempting but… no, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I think I will try this one.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh – right – on second thoughts maybe it
wasn’t that bad. Actually – it’s a sort of masterpiece really. None of
those childish kebab stories you get in so many travel books these days.
And I’ll throw in one of these for free.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Very useful for lighting fires, wrapping
fish, that sort of things.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Cappuccino as ordered.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Thanks. I don’t think you’ll believe who
was just in here.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Who? Someone famous?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No. No-one – no-one.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Would be exciting if someone famous did come
into the shop though, wouldn’t it? Do you know – this is pretty
incredible actually – I once saw Ringo Starr. Or at least I think it was
Ringo. It might have been that broke from ‘Fiddler On The Roof,’
Toppy.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Topol.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: That’s right – Topol.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: But Ringo Starr doesn’t look anything like
Topol.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: No, well… he was quite a long way away.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: So it could have been neither of them?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I suppose so.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right. It’s not a classic anecdotes, is
it?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Not classic, no.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right – want another one?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes. No, wait – let’s go crazy – I’ll have
an orange juice.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Here, let me help.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Nothing, nothing… Look, I live just over
the street – you could get cleaned up.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No thank you. I need to get my car back.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I also have a phone. I’m confident that in
five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street
again… in the non-prostitute sense obviously.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Okay. So what does ‘just over the street’ mean
– give it to me in yards.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Eighteen yards. That’s my house there.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Come on in. I’ll just…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It’s not that tidy, I fear.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: The bathroom is right at the top of the
stairs and there’s a phone on the desk up there.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Would you like a cup of tea before you
go?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Orange juice – probably not.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Something else cold – coke, water, some
disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits
of the forest?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Really, no.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Would you like something to nibble –
apricots, soaked in honey – quite why, no one knows – because it stops
them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you
wanted honey, you’d just buy honey, instead of apricots, but
nevertheless – there we go – yours if you want them.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Do you always say ‘no’ to everything?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No. I better be going. Thanks for your
help.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You’re welcome and, may I also say…
heavenly.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Take my one chance to say it. After you’ve
read that terrible book, you’re certainly not going to be coming back to
the shop.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes. Well. My pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: ‘Surreal but nice.’ What was I
thinking?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Coming.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh hi. Forget something?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I forgot my bag.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh right.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Here we go.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thanks. Well…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I apologize for the ‘surreal but nice’
comment. Disaster…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Don’t worry about it. I thought the apricot
and honey business was the real lowpoint.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh my God. My flatmate. I’m sorry – there’s
no excuse for him.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: I’m just going to go into the kitchen to get
some food – and then I’m going to tell you a story that will make your
balls shrink to the size of raisins.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Probably best not tell anyone about this.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right. No one. I mean, I’ll tell myself
sometimes but… don’t worry – I won’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: There’s something wrong with this yogurt.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It’s not yogurt – it’s mayonnaise.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Well, there you go. On for a video fest
tonight? I’ve got some absolute classic.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Smile.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Smile.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’ve got nothing to smile about.</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: Okay in about 7 seconds, I’m going to ask
you to marry me.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Imagine – somewhere in the world there’s a
man who’s allowed to kiss her.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes, she is fairly fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Do you have any books by Dickens?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, we’re a travel bookshop. We only sell
travel books.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Oh right. How about that new John Grisham
thriller?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, that’s a novel too.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Oh right. Have you got a copy of ‘Winnie
the Pooh’?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Martin – your customer.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Just incidentally – why are you wearing
that?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Ahm – combination of factors really. No clean
clothes…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: There never will be, you know, unless you
actually clean your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Right. Vicious circle. And then I was like
rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought – cool.
Kind of spacey.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: There’s something wrong with the goggles
though…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, they were prescription, so I could see
all the fishes properly.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Groovy. You should do more of this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: So – any messages?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Yeh, I wrote a couple down.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Two? That’s it?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: You want me to write down all your
messages?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Who were the ones you didn’t write down
from?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Ahm let’s see – ahm. No. Gone completely. Oh
no, wait. There was – one from your mum: she said don’t forget lunch and
her leg’s hurting again.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right. No one else?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Though if we’re going for this obsessive
writing-down-all-messages thing – some American girl called Anna called
a few days ago.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Well, it was genuinely bizarre… she said, hi
– it’s Anna – and then she said, call me at the Ritz – and then gave
herself a completely different name.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Which was?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Absolutely no idea. Remembering one name’s
bad enough…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ritz man</strong>: May I help you, sir?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Ahm, look this is a very odd situation. I’m
a friend of Anna Scott’s – and she rang me at home the day before
yesterday – and left a message saying she’s staying with you…</p>
<p><strong>ritz man</strong>: I’m sorry, we don’t have anyone of that
name here, sir.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, that’s right – I know that. She said
she’s using another name – but the problem is she left the message with
my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.</p>
<p><strong>ritz man</strong>: Yes, sir. I have him in my mind.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: And then double it – and that is the – what
can I say – git I’m living with and he cannot remember…</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Try ‘Flintstone.’</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: I think she said her name was
‘Flintstone.’</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Does ‘Flintstone’ mean anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>ritz man</strong>: I’ll put you right through, sir.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh my God.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hello. Hi. Hi.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh hi. It’s William Thacker. We, ahm I work
in a bookshop.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You played it pretty cool here, waiting for
three days to call.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, I’ve never played anything cool in my
entire life. Spike, who I’ll stab to death later, never gave me the
message.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh – Okay.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Perhaps I could drop round for tea or
something?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yeh – unfortunately, things are going to be
pretty busy, but… okay, let’s give it a try. Four o’clock could be
good.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right. Great. Classic. Classic.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Which floor?</p>
<p><strong>tarquin</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Are you sure you…?</p>
<p><strong>tarquin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh. Right.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Hello, I’m Karen. Sorry – things are running
a bit late. Here’s the thing…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: What did you think of the film?</p>
<p><strong>tarquin</strong>: Marvellous. ‘Close Encounters’ meets ‘Jean
De Florette.’ Oscar- winning stuff.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: I’m sorry. I didn’t get down what magazines
you’re from.</p>
<p><strong>tarquin</strong>: ‘Time Out.’</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Great. And you…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: ‘Horse and Hound.’ The name’s William
Whacker. I think she might be expecting me.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Okay – take a seat. I’ll check.</p>
<p><strong>tarquin</strong>: You’ve brought her flowers?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No – they’re… for my grandmother. She’s in
a hospital nearby. Thought I’d kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p><strong>tarquin</strong>: I’m sorry. Which hospital?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Do you mind me not saying – it’s a rather
distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it
away.</p>
<p><strong>tarquin</strong>: Oh sure. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Mr. Thacker.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You’ve got five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I brought these, but clearly…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh no, ho – these are great.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Sorry about not ringing back. The whole
two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman’s pea-sized
intellect.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, it’s a stupid privacy thing. I always
choose a cartoon character – last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Everything okay?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: And you are from ‘Horse and Hound’
magazine?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is that so?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: So I’ll just fire away, shall I?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right. Ahm… the film’s great… and I just
wondered – whether you ever thought of having more… horses in it?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Ahm – well – we would have liked to – but it
was difficult, obviously, being set in space.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Obviously. Very difficult.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’m sorry – I arrived outside – they thrust
this thing into my hand – I didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, it’s my fault, I thought this would all be
over by now. I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing. I
seriously don’t know what got in to me. I just wanted to make sure you
were fine about it.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Absolutely fine about it.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Do remember that Miss Scott is also keen to
talk about her next project, which is shooting later in the summer.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh yes – excellent. Ahm – any horses in
that one? Or hounds, of course. Our readers are equally intrigued by
both species.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It takes place on a submarine.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes. Right… But if there were horses, would
you be riding them yourself or would you be getting a stunt horse person
double sort of thing?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’m just a complete moron. Sorry. This is
the sort of thing that happens in dreams – not in real life. Good
dreams, obviously – it’s a dream to see you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And what happens next in the dream?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, I suppose in the dream dream
scenario. I just… ahm, change my personality, because you can do that in
dreams, and walk across and kiss the girl but you know it’ll never
happen.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Time’s up, I’m afraid. Sorry it was so
short. Did you get what you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Very nearly.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Maybe time for one last question?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Are you busy tonight?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but
nice.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Thank you. You are ‘Horse and Hound’s’
favorite actress. You and Black Beauty. Tied.</p>
<p><strong>tarquin</strong>: How was she?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Fabulous.</p>
<p><strong>tarquin</strong>: Wait a minute – she took your grandmother’s
flowers?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes. That’s right. Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: If you’d like to come with me we can rush you
through the others.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: The others?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Mr. Thacker’s from ‘Horse and Hound.’</p>
<p><strong>male lead</strong>: Pleased to meet you. Did you like the
film?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Ah… yes, enormously.</p>
<p><strong>male lead</strong>: Well, fire away.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right, right. Ahm – did you enjoy making
the film?</p>
<p><strong>male lead</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Any bit in particular?</p>
<p><strong>male lead</strong>: Well, you tell me which bit you liked
most – and I’ll tell you if I enjoyed making it.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space
very much. Did you enjoy making that bit?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Did you identify with the character you
were playing?</p>
<p><strong>interpreter</strong>: Te identicaste con el personaje que
interpretabas?</p>
<p><strong>foreign actor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>interpreter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Ah. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>interpreter</strong>: Por que no?</p>
<p><strong>foreign actor</strong>: Porque es un robot carnivoro
psicopata.</p>
<p><strong>interpreter</strong>: Because he is playing a psychopathic
flesh-eating robot.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Classic.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Is this your first film?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: No – it’s my 22nd.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Of course it is. Any favourite among the
22?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Working with Leonardo.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Da Vinci?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Di Caprio.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Of course. And is he your favourite Italian
film director?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Mr. Thacker?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Have you got a moment?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Ahm. That thing I was doing tonight – I’m not
doing it any more. I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain’s
premier equestrian journalist.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh well, great. Perfect. Oh no – shittity
brickitty – it’s my sister’s birthday – shit – we’re meant to be having
dinner.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Okay – fine.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: But no, I’m sure I can get out of it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, I mean, if it’s fine with you, I’ll, you
know, be your date.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You’ll be my date at my little sister’s
birthday party?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: If that’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’m sure it’s all right. My friend Max is
cooking and he’s acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you
know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He’s bringing a girl?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Miracles do happen.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Does the girl have a name?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: He wouldn’t say.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Christ, what is going on in there?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Come on in. Vague food crisis.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Hiya – sorry – the guinea fowl is proving
more complicated than expected.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: He’s cooking guinea fowl?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Don’t even ask.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Hi. Good Lord – you’re the spitting image
of…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Bella – this is Anna.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Okay. Crisis over.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Max. This is Anna.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hello, Anna ahm… Scott – have some wine.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yes, Happy Birthday.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Look, your brother has brought this girl, and
ahm…</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Hi guys. Oh holy fuck.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hun – this is Anna. Anna – this is Honey –
she’s my baby sitter.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hiya.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Oh God this is one of those key moments in
life, when it’s possible you can be really, genuinely cool – and I’m
going to fail a hundred percent. I absolutely and totally and utterly
adore you and I think you’re the most beautiful woman in the world and
more importantly I genuinely believe and have believed for some time now
that we can be best friends. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Ahm… I think that sounds – you know – lucky
me. Happy Birthday.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Oh my God. You gave me a present. We’re best
friends already. Marry Will – he’s a really nice guy and then we can be
sisters.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’ll think about it.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’ll be Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Hello, Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I’m sorry I’m so late. Bollocksed up at work
again, I fear. Millions down the drain.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Bernie – this is Anna.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Hello, Anna. Delighted to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Honey Bunny – happy birthday to you. It’s a
hat. You don’t have to wear it or anything.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You haven’t slept with her, have you?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That is a cheap question and the answer is,
of course, no comment.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: ‘No comment’ means ‘yes.’</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, it doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Do you ever masturbate?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Definitely no comment.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You see – it means ‘yes.’</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: So tell me Anna – what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m an actress.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Splendid. I’m actually in the stock- market,
so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff –
P.G. Wodehouse, you know – farce, all that. ‘Ooh – careful there,
vicar.’ Always imagined it’s a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean
the wages are a scandal, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, they can be.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: I see friends from university – clever chaps
– been in the business longer than you – they’re scraping by on seven,
eight thousand a year. It’s no life. What sort of acting do you do?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Films mainly.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Oh splendid. Well done. How’s the pay in
movies? I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Fifteen million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Right. Right. So that’s… fairly good. On the
high side… have you tried the nuts?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Right – I think we’re ready.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I wonder if you could tell me where the…?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Oh, it’s just down the corridor on the
right.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: I’ll show you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Quickly, quickly – talk very quickly what are
you doing here with Anna Scott?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Anna Scott?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: The movie star?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Oh God. Oh God. Oh Goddy God.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: I don’t believe it. I walked into the loo
with her. I was still talking when she started unbuttoning her jeans…
She had to ask me to leave.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: What do you think of the guinea fowl?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m a vegetarian.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Oh God.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what
I’ve long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of
under-achievers.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Shame!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m not saying it’s a bad thing, in fact, I
think it’s something we should take pride in. I’m going to give the last
brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Well, obviously it’s me, isn’t it – I work
in the City in a job I don’t understand and everyone keeps getting
promoted above me. I haven’t had a girlfriends since… puberty and, well,
the long and short of it is, nobody fancies me, and if these cheeks get
any chubbier, they never will.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Nonsense. I fancy you. Or I did before you
got so far.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You see – and unless I’m much mistaken, your
job still pays you rather a lot of money, while Honey here, she earns
nothing flogging her guts out at London’s seediest record store.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Yes. And I don’t have hair – I’ve got
feathers, and I’ve got funny goggly eyes, and I’m attracted to cruel men
and … no one’ll ever marry me because my boosies have actually started
shrinking.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You see – incredibly sad.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: On the other hand, her best friend is Anna
Scott.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: That’s true, I can’t deny it. She needs me,
what can I say?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: And most of her limbs work. Whereas I’m stuck
in its thing day and night, in a house full of ramps. And to add insult
to serious injury – I’ve totally given up smoking, my favourite thing,
and the truth is… we can’t have a baby.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Bella.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: No. Not true…</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: C’est la vie… We’re lucky in lots of ways,
but… Surely it’s worth a brownie.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well, I don’t know. Look at William. Very
unsuccessful professionally. Divorced. Used to be handsome, now kind of
squidgy around the edges – and absolutely certain never to hear from
Anna again after she’s heard that his nickname at school was Floppy.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: So I get the brownie?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I think you do, yes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Wait a minute. What about me?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sorry? You think you deserve the
brownie?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well… a shot at it.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You’ll have to prove it. This is a great
brownie and I’m going to fight for it. State your claim.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, I’ve been on a diet since I was
nineteen, which means basically I’ve been hungry for a decade. I’ve had
a sequence of not nice boyfriends – one of whom hit me: and every time
my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as
entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like
this…</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Really – and one day, not long from now…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: … my looks will go, they’ll find out I can’t
act and I’ll become a sad middle-aged woman who looks a bit like someone
who was famous for a while.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Nah!!! Nice try, gorgeous – but you don’t fool
anyone.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Pathetic effort to hog the brownie.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That was such a great evening.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m delighted.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And may I say that’s a gorgeous tie.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Now you’re lying.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re right. I told you I was bad at
acting.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Lovely to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: And you. I’ll wait till you’ve gone before I
tell him you’re a vegetarian.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Night, night, Honey.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: I’m so sorry about the loo thing. I meant to
leave but I just… look, ring me if you need someone to go shopping with.
I know lots of nice, cheap places… not that money necessarily… nice to
meet you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You too – from now on you are my style
guru.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Love your work.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Sorry – they always do that when I leave
the house.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Floppy, huh?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It’s the hair! It’s to do with the
hair.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why is she in a wheelchair?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It was an accident – about eighteen months
ago.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And the pregnancy thing – is that to do with
the accident?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You know, I’m not sure. I don’t think
they’d tried for kids before, as fate would have it.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Would you like to come… my house is
just…?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Too complicated.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Busy tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I thought you were leaving.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I was.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What’s in there?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Gardens. All these streets round here have
these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They’re like
little villages.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Let’s go in.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Ah no – that’s the point – they’re private
villages – only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You abide by rules like that?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Ahm…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Heck no – other people do – but not me – I
just do what I want.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Whoopsidaisies.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes, you did.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You said ‘whoopsidaisies.’</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t think so. No one has said
‘whoopsidaisies,’ do they – I mean unless they’re…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: There’s no ‘unless.’ No one has said
“whoopsidaisies” for fifty years and even then it was only little girls
with blonde ringlets.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Exactly. Here we go again.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Whoopsidaisies.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It’s a disease I’ve got – it’s a clinical
thing. I’m taking pills and having injections – it won’t last long.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Step aside.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Actually be careful Anna – it’s harder than
it looks…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh no it’s not – it’s easy.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Come on, Flops.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Now seriously – what in the world in this
garden could make that ordeal worthwhile?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Nice garden.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: ‘For June, who loved this garden – from Joseph
who always sat beside her.’</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Some people do spend their whole lives
together.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks. Have you seen
my glasses?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: No, ’fraid not.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Bollocks. This happens every time I go to
the cinema. Average day, my glasses are everywhere – everywhere I look,
glasses. But the moment I need them they disappear. It’s one of life’s
real cruelties.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: That’s compared to, like, earthquakes in the
Far East or testicular cancer?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh shit, is that the time? I have to
go.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Thanks for your help on the glasses
thing.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: You’re welcome. Did you find them?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Sort of.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So who left who?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: She left me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: She saw through me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Uh-oh. That’s not good.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: No - No- No! Give me Anna Scott any
day.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: I didn’t like that last film of hers. Fast
asleep from the moment the lights went down.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Don’t really care what the films are like.
Any film with her in it – fine by me.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: No – not my type at all really. I prefer
that other one – blonde – sweet looking – has an orgasm every time you
take her out for a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Meg Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: Drug-induced, I hear – I believe she’s
actually in rehab as we speak.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Whatever, she’s so clearly up for it.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: You know – some girls, they’re all ‘stay
away chum’ but Anna, she’s absolutely gagging for it. Do you know that
in over fifty percent of languages the word for “actress” is the same as
the word for “prostitute.”</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: And Anna is your definitive actress –
someone really filthy you can just flip over…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right, that’s it.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’m sorry to disturb you guys but –</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, yes, I wish I hadn’t overheard your
conversation – but I did and I just think, you know…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: …the person you’re talking about is a real
person and I think she probably deserves a little bit more
consideration, rather than having jerks like you drooling over her…</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Oh sod off, mate. What are you, her
dad?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, that’s fine. I love that you tried… time
was I’d have done the same.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: In fact – give me a second.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m sorry about my friend – he’s very
sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>lawrence</strong>: No, look, I’m sorry…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Please, please – let’s just leave it there.
I’m sure you meant no harm, and I’m sure it was just friendly banter and
I’m sure you dicks are all the size of peanuts. A perfect match for the
size of your brains. Enjoy your meal. The tuna’s really good.</p>
<p><strong>gerald</strong>: You prick.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I shouldn’t have done that. I shouldn’t have
done that.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, you were brilliant</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m rash and I’m stupid and what am I doing
with you?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t know, I’m afraid.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know either.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Here we are. Do you want to come up?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: There seem to be lots of reasons why I
shouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: There are lots of reasons. Do you want to come
up?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Give me five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hiya.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: To be able to do that is such a wonderful
thing.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’ve got to go.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in
America, is in fact in the next room.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Your boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Ahm… room service.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: How you doing? I thought you guys all wore
those penguin coats.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, yes – usually – I’d just changed to
go home – but I thought I’d just deal with this final call.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Oh great. Could you do me a favour and try to
get us some really cold water up here?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Still, not sparkling.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Absolutely. Ice cold still water.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Unless it’s illegal in the UK to serve liquids
below room temperature: I don’t want you going to jail just to satisfy
my whims…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, I’m sure it’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: And maybe you could just adios the dishes and
empty the trash.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Really – don’t do that – I’m sure this is not
his job.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: I’m sorry. Is this a problem?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Ah – no. It’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Ahm… Bernie.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Thank you, Bernie. Hey – nice surprise, or
nasty surprise?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Nice surprise.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Liar. She hates surprises. What are you
ordering?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I haven’t decided.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: Well, don’t over-do it. I don’t want people
saying, ’There goes that famous actor with the big, fat girlfriend.”</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I better leave.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: – this is a fairly strange reality to be
faced with. To be honest, I don’t realize…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m sorry… I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I think goodbye is traditional.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Come on – open up – this is me – Spikey – I’m
in contact with some quite important spiritual vibrations. What’s
wrong?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, okay. There’s this girl…</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Aha! I’d been getting a female vibe. Good.
Speak on, dear friend.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: She’s someone I just can’t – someone who…
self-evidently can’t be mine – and it’s as if I’ve taken love-heroin –
and now I can’t even have it again. I’ve opened Pandora’s box. And
there’s trouble inside.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Yeh. Yeh… tricky… tricky… I knew a girl at
school called Pandora … never got to see her box though.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Thanks. Yes – very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You didn’t know she had a boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No – did you?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Bloody hell, I can’t believe it – my whole
life ruined because I don’t read ‘Hello’ magazine.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Let’s face facts. This was always a no-go
situation. Anna’s a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get
involved with the gods.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Buggered?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Every time. But don’t despair – I think I have
the solution to your problems.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Her name is Tessa and she works in the
contracts department. The hair, I admit, is unfashionable frizzy – but
she’s as bright as a button and kisses like a nymphomaniac on death row.
Apparently.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Now – try.</p>
<p><strong>tessa</strong>: I got completely lost – it’s real difficult,
isn’t it? Everything’s got the word ‘Kensington’ in it – Kensington Park
Road, Kensington Gardens, Kensington bloody Park Gardens…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Tessa – this is Bella my wife.</p>
<p><strong>tessa</strong>: Oh hello, you’re in a wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And this is William.</p>
<p><strong>tessa</strong>: Hello William. Max has told me everything
about you.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Has he?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Wine?</p>
<p><strong>tessa</strong>: Oh yes please. Come on, Willie, let’s get
sloshed.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Keziah – some woodcock?</p>
<p><strong>keziah</strong>: No, thank you – I’m a fruitarian.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t realize that.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: And ahm – what’s a fruitarian exactly?</p>
<p><strong>keziah</strong>: We believe that fruits and vegetables have
feelings so we think cooking is cruel. We only eat things that have
actually fallen from the tree or bush – that are, in fact, dead
already.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right. Right. Interesting stuff. So these
carrots…</p>
<p><strong>keziah</strong>: Have been murdered, yes.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Murdered? Poor carrots. How beastly.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Delicious coffee.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Thank you. I’m sorry about the lamb.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: No – I thought it was really, you know,
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Interesting means inedible.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Really inedible – yes that’s right.</p>
<p><strong>rosie</strong>: Maybe we’ll meet again some time.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes. That would be… great.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: She’s perfect, perfect.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I think you have forgotten… what an unusual
situation you have here – to find someone you actually love, who’ll love
you – the chances are… always miniscule. Look at me – not counting the
American – I’ve only loved two girls in my whole life, both total
disasters.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s not fair.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No really, one of them marries me and then
leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones – and the other, who
seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best
friend.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Still loves you though.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: In a depressingly asexual way.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I never fancied you much actually…</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I mean I loved you – you were terribly funny.
But all that kissing my ears…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh no – this is just getting worse. I am
going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Do you want to stay?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Why not – all that awaits me at home is a
masturbating Welshman.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hi. Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: They were taken years ago – I know it was…
well, I was poor and it happens a lot – that’s not an excuse – but to
make things worse, it now appears someone was filming me as well. So
what was a stupid photo- shoot now looks like a porno film. And well…
the pictures have been solid and they’re everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know where to go. The hotel is
surrounded.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: This is the place.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Thank you. I’m just in London for two days –
but, with your papers, it’s the worse place to be.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: These are such horrible pictures. They’re so
grainy… they make me look like…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Don’t think about it. We’ll sort it out.
Now what would you like – tea … bath…?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: A bath would be great.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Christ alive… brilliant… fantastic ….
magnificent…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You must be Spike.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Just checking.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Thank you, God.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m really sorry about last time. He just flew
in – I had no idea – in fact, I had no idea if he’d ever fly in
again.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, that’s fine. It’s not often one has the
opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star. It was a
thrill for me. How is he?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t know. It got to the point where I
couldn’t remember any of the reasons I loved him. And you… and love?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, there’s a question – without an
interesting answer.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I have thought about you.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh no no – no.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Just anytime I’ve tried to keep things normal
with anyone normal – it’s been a disaster.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the
film you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes – start in L.A. on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Would you like me to take you through your
lines?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Would you? It’s all talk, talk, talk.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hand it over. Basic plot?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m a difficult but brilliant junior officer
who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear
disaster.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well done you.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: ‘Message from command. Would you like them
to send in the HKs?’</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: ‘No, turn over 4 TRS’s and tell them we need
radar feedback before the KFT’s return at 19 hundred – then inform the
Pentagon that we’ll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through
12.15’ – and don’t you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made
in that speech or I’ll pelt you with olives.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: ‘Very well, captain – I’ll pass that on
straightaway.’</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: ‘Thank you.’ How many mistake did I make?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Eleven.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Damn. ‘And Wainwright…’</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Cartwright.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: ‘Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name
is, I promised little Jimmy I’d be home for his birthday – could you get
a message through that I may be a little late.’</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: ‘Certainly. And little Johnny?’</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: My son’s name is Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, get a message through to him too.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Brilliant. Word perfect I’d say.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Gripping. It’s not Jane Austen, it’s not
Henry James, but it’s gripping.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You think I should do Henry James instead?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’m sure you’d be great in Henry James.
But, you know – this writer’s pretty damn good too.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes – I mean – you never get anyone in ‘Wings
of a Dove’ having the nerve to say ‘inform the Pentagon that we need
black star cover.’</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: And I think the book is the poorer for
it.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I can’t believe you have that picture on your
wall.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You like Chagall?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I do. It feels like how being in love should
be. Floating through a dark blue sky.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: With a goat playing a violin.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes – happiness wouldn’t be happiness without
a violin-playing goat.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Voila. Carnival Calypso, for the Queen of
Notting Hill – pepperoni, pineapple and a little more pepperoni.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t mention that Anna’s a vegetarian,
did I?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I
just peel the skin off, it’ll be perfect.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’ve got big feet.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes. Always have had.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You know what they say about men with big
feet?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Big feet – large shoes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The thing that’s so irritating is that now I’m
so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You actually have clauses in your contact
about nudity?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Definitely. ‘You may show the dent at the top
of the artist’s buttocks – but neither cheek. In the event of a stunt
person being used, the artist must have full consultation.’</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You have a stunt bottom?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I could have a stunt bottom, yes.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Would you be tempted to go for a slightly
better bottom than your own?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Definitely. Ths is important stuff.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It’s one hell of a job. What do you put on
your passport? Profession – Mel Gibson’s bottom.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why
wouldn’t he? It’s delicious.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: The ice cream or Mel Gibson’s bottom?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Both.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Today has ben a good day. Which under the
circumstances is… unexpected.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, thank you. Anyway – time for bed. Or…
sofa-bed.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh my God… Hello.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Hello. I wonder if I could have a little
word.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Spike.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: I don’t want to interfere, or anything … but
she’s split up from her boy- friend, that’s right isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: And she’s in your house.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: And you get on very well.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Well, isn’t this perhaps a good opportunity
to… slip her one?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Spike. For God’s sake – she’s in trouble –
get a grip.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Right. Right. You think it’s the wrong
moment. Fair enough. Do you mind if I have a go?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Spike!</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: No – you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’ll talk to you in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Okay – okay. Might be too late, but okay.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh please sod off.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No! No. Wait. I… thought you were someone
else. I thought you were Spike. I’m delighted you’re not.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that
I’m allowed to see you naked.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You and every person in this country.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh God yes – I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What is it about men and nudity? Particularly
breasts – how can you be so interested in them?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No seriously. I mean, they’re just breasts.
Every second person in the world has got them…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: More than that actually, when you think
about it. You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: But… they’re odd-looking. They’re for milk.
Your mum’s got them. You must have seen a thousand of them – what’s the
fuss about?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Actually, I can’t think really – let me
just have a quick look…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, beats me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Rita Hayworth used to say – ‘they go to bed
with Gilda – they wake up with me.’ Do you feel that?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Who was Gilda?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Her most famous part – men went to bed with
the dream – and they didn’t like it when they woke up with the reality –
do you feel that way with me?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You’re lovelier this morning than you have
ever been.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Breakfast in bed. Or lunch, or brunch.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Can I stay a bit longer?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Stay forever.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Damn, I forgot the jam.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You get the door, I’ll get the jam.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Don’t ask.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re up to something…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh my God. And they got a photo of you dressed
like that?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Undressed like this, yes.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Morning, daring ones.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s Anna. The press are here. No, there are
hundreds of them. My brilliant plan was not so brilliant after all. Yeh,
I know, I know. Just get me out then. Damnit.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I wouldn’t go outside.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Just take my work for it.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: How did I look?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Not bad. No bad at all. Well-chosen briefs,
I’d say. Chicks love grey. Mmmmm. Nice firm buttocks.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: How do you think I’m doing?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I don’t know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I do. Your furry friend thought he’d make a
buck or two telling the papers where I was.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s not true.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Really? The entire British press just woke up
this morning and thought ‘Hey – I know where Anna Scott is. She’s in
that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.’ And then you go out in
your goddamn underwear.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: I went out in my goddamn underwear too.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Get out, Spike. I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: This is such a mess. I come to you to protect
myself against more crappy gossip and now I’m landed in it all over
again. For God’s sake, I’ve got a boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: As far as they’re concerned I do. And now
tomorrow there’ll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to
Timbuktu.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I know, I know – but… just – let’s stay
calm…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You can stay calm – it’s the perfect situation
for you – minimum input, maximum publicity. Everyone you ever bump into
will know. ‘Well done you – you slept with that actress – we’ve seen the
pictures.’</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s spectacularly unfair.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a
boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Now stop. Stop. I beg you – calm down. Have
a cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I don’t want a goddamn cup of tea. I want to
go home.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Spike, check who that is… and for God’s
sake put some clothes on.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Looks like a chauffeur to me.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And remember – Spike owes you an expensive
dinner. Or holiday – depending if he’s got the brains to get the going
rate on betrayal.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s not true. And wait a minute… this is
crazy behavior. Can’t we just laugh about this? Seriously – in the huge
sweep of things, this stuff doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: What he’s going to say next is – there are
people starving in the Sudan.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, there are. And we don’t need to go
anywhere near that far. My best friend slipped – she slipped down-
stairs, cracked her back and she’s in a wheelchair for the rest of her
life. All I’m asking for is a normal amount of perspective.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You’re right: of course, you’re right. It’s
just that I’ve dealt with this garbage for ten years now – you’ve had it
for ten minutes. Our perspectives are different.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I mean – today’s newspapers will be lining
tomorrow’s waste paper bins.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, you know – it’s just one day. Today’s
papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You really don’t get it. This story gets
filed. Every time anyone writes anything about me – they’ll dig up these
photos. Newspapers last forever. I’ll regret this forever.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right. Fine. I will do the opposite, if
it’s all right by you – and always be glad you came. But you’re right –
you probably better go.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Was it you?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: I suppose I might have told one or two people
down the pub.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Have we got something for you. Something
which will make you love me so much you’ll want to hug me every single
day for the rest of my life.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Blimey. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: The phone number of Anna Scott’s agent in
London and her agent in New York. You can ring her. You think about her
all the time – now you can ring her!</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Well, thanks, that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: It is great, isn’t it. See you tonight. Hey,
Marty– sexy cardy.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I have a little speech to make – I won’t
stand up because I can’t… be bothered. Exactly a year ago today, this
man here started the finest restaurant in London.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Unfortunately – no one ever came to eat
here.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: A tiny hiccough.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: And so we must face the fact that from next
week, we have to find somewhere near to eat.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I just want to say to Tony – don’t take it
personally. The more I think about things, the more I see no rhyme or
reason in life – no one knows why some things work out, and some things
don’t – why some of us get lucky – and some of us…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: … get fired.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Yes, they’re shifting the whole outfit much
more towards the trading side – and of course… I was total crap.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: So we go down together! A toast to Bernie –
the worst stockbroker in the whole world!</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Since it’s an evening of announcements … I’ve
also got one, Ahm… I’ve decided to get engaged.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: I’ve found myself a nice, slightly odd
looking bloke who I know is going to make me happy for the rest of my
life.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Wait a minute – I’m your brother and I
don’t know anything about this.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is it someone we know?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Yes. I will keep you informed.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: By the way – it’s you.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Me?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Yes. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Well, yes. Groovy.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Any more announcements?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes – I feel I must apologize to everyone
for my behavior for the last six months. I have, as you know, been
slightly down in the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There’s an understatement. There are dead
people on better form.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: But I wish to make it clear I’ve turned a
corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: I’m really horribly drunk.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So – you’ve laid the ghost.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I believe I have.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Don’t give a damn about the famous girl.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, don’t think I do.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Which means you won’t be distracted by the fact
that she’s back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming
most days on Hampstead Heath.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh God no.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So not over her, in fact.</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes – I was looking for Anna Scott…</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: Does she know you’re coming?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No, no. She doesn’t.</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: I’m afraid I can’t really let you through
then, sir.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh right. I mean, I am a friend – I’m not a
lunatic but – no, you basically…</p>
<p><strong>security</strong>: … can’t let you through.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: This is certainly… ah…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I only found out you were here
yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I was going to ring… but… I didn’t think you’d
want to…</p>
<p><strong>third</strong>: Anna.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s not going very well – and it’s our last
day.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Absolutely – you’re clearly very busy.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: But… wait… there are things to say.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Drink tea – there’s lots of tea.</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Come and have a look…</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: Are you a fan of Henry James?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: This is Henry James film?</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: This is Harry – he’ll give you a pair of
headphones so you can hear the dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Here we go. The volume control is on the
side.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s great.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: We are living in cloudcuckooland – we’ll
never get this done today.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: We have to. I’ve got to be in New York on
Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Oh, stop showing off.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: God, that’s an enormous arse.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I’m not listening.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: No, but seriously – it’s not fair – so many
tragic young teenagers with anorexia – and that girl has an arse she
could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women – and
still be beg-bottomed.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I said I’m not listening – and I think,
looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an
‘arse’ would be well-advised to keep quiet.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: So I ask you when you’re going to tell
everyone, and you say…?</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: ‘Tomorrow will be soon enough.’</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: And then I… right.</p>
<p><strong>james</strong>: Who was that rather difficult chap you were
talking to on the way up?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh… no one… no one. Just some… guy from the
past. I don’t know what he’s doing here. Bit of an awkward
situation.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>harry</strong>: Anytime.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I’m going to throw out these old
videos.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: No. You can’t bin these. They’re classics.
I’m not allowing this.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right – let’s talk about rent…</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Let me help. We don’t want all this shit
cluttering up our lives.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I have to disturb you when you’re cooking
the books, but there’s a delivery.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Martin, can’t you just deal with this
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: But it’s not for the shop. It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Okay. Tell me, would I have to pay a wet
rag as much as I pay you?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes – I’m sorry – I had to leave… I didn’t
want to disturb you.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well… how have you been?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Fine. Everything much the same. When they
change the law Spike and I will marry immediately. Whereas you… I’ve
watched in wonder. Awards, glory …</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Oh no. It’s all nonsense, believe me. I had no
idea how much nonsense it all was – but nonsense it all is… Well,
yesterday was our last day filming and so I’m just off – but I brought
you this from home, and…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I thought I’d give it to you.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Thank you. Shall I…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, don’t open it yet – I’ll be
embarrassed.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Okay – well, thank you. I don’t know what
it’s for. But thank you anyway.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I actually had it in my apartment in New York
and just thought you’d… but, when it came to it, I didn’t know how to
call you… having behaved so… badly, twice. So it’s been just sitting in
the hotel. But then… you came, so I figured… the thing is… the thing is
…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: What’s the thing?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Don’t even think about it. Go away
immediately.</p>
<p><strong>mr. smith</strong>: Right. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: You were saying…</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes. The thing is… I have to go away today but
I wondered, if I didn’t, whether you might let me see you a bit… or, a
lot maybe… see if you could… like me again.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: But yesterday… that actor asked you who I
was… and you just dismissed me out of hand… I heard – you had a
microphone… I had headphones.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: You expect me to tell the truth about my life
to the most indiscreet man in England?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Excuse me – it’s your mother on the
phone.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Can you tell her I’ll ring her back.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: I actually tried that tack – but she said
you said that before and it’s been twenty-four hours, and her foot that
was purple is now a sort of blackish color…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Okay – perfect timing as ever – hold the
fort for a second will you, Martin?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Can I just say, I thought ‘Ghost’ was a
wonderful film.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Yes… I’ve always wondered what Patrick
Swayze is like in real life.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I can’t say I know Patrick all that well.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh dear. He wasn’t friendly during the
filming?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Well, no – I’m sure he was friendly – to Demi
Moore – who acted with him in ‘Ghost.’</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Oh right. Right. Sorry. Always been a bit of
an ass.</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Anyway… it’s lovely to meet you. I’m a great
fan of yours. And Demi’s, of course.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: That’s fine. There’s always a pause when the
jury goes out to consider its verdict.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Anna. Look – I’m a fairly level- headed
bloke. Not often in and out of love. But…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: … can I just say ‘no’ to your kind request
and leave it at that?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: … Yes, that’s fine. Of course. I… you know… of
course… I’ll just… be getting along then… nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: The truth is…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: … with you, I’m in real danger. It took
like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours – but my
relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once
again … cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be. There are too
many pictures of you everywhere, too many films. You’d go and I’d be…
well, buggered, basically.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I see. That reality is a real ‘no,’ isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly
Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble
remembering my name.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Okay. Fine. Fine. Good decision.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: The fame thing isn’t really real, you know.
Don’t forget – I’m also just a girl. Standing in front of a boy. Asking
him to love her.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: What do you think? Good move?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Good move: when all is said and done, she’s
nothing special. I saw her taking her pants off and I definitely
glimpsed some cellulite down there.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Good decision. All actresses are mad as
snakes.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Tony – what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Never met her, never want to.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Brilliant. Max?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Great. Excellent. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: I was called and I came. What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: William has just turned down Anna Scott.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: You daft prick!</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: This painting isn’t the original, is it?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes, I think that one may be.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: But she said she wanted to go out with
you?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes – sort of…</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: That’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Well, you know, anybody saying they want to
go out with you is… pretty great… isn’t it…</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: It was sort of sweet actually – I mean, I
know she’s an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line – but she
said that she might be as famous as can be – but also… that she was just
a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Oh sod a dog. I’ve made the wrong decision,
haven’t I?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Max, how fast is your car?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: If anyone gets in our way – we have small
nuclear devices.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: And we intend to use them!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where’s Bella?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: She’s not coming.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Sod that. Bernie – in the back!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Come on, babe.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Down Kensington Church Street, then
Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Crazy. Go along Bayswater…</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: That’s right – then Park Lane.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Or you could go right down to Cromwell Road,
and left.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Stop right there! I will decide the route. All
right?</p>
<p><strong>all</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: James Bond never has to put up with this sort
of shit.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: Bloody hell, this is fun.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Is Miss Scott staying here?</p>
<p><strong>ritz man</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: How about Miss Flintstone?</p>
<p><strong>ritz man</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Or Bambi… or, I don’t know, Beavis or
Butthead?</p>
<p><strong>ritz man</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Right. Right. Fair enough. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ritz man</strong>: There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126 –
but she checked out an hour ago. I believe she’s holding a press
conference at The Savoy before flying to America.</p>
<p><strong>bernie</strong>: We have lift off!!</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Bugger this for a bunch of bananas.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: You’re my hero.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Go!</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Excuse me, where’s the press
conference?</p>
<p><strong>man at savoy</strong>: Are you an accredited member of the
press?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>man at savoy</strong>: That’s a Blockbuster video membership
card, sir.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s right… I work for their in- house
magazine. ‘Movies are our business.’</p>
<p><strong>man at savoy</strong>: I’m sorry, sir…</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: He’s with me.</p>
<p><strong>man at savoy</strong>: And you are?</p>
<p><strong>bella</strong>: Writing an article about how London hotels
treat people in wheelchairs.</p>
<p><strong>man at savoy</strong>: Of course, madam. It’s in the
Lancaster Room. I’m afraid you’re very late.</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: Run!</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Yes… You – Dominic.</p>
<p><strong>questioner 1</strong>: How much longer are you staying in the
UK then?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No time at all. I fly out tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Which is why we have to round it up now.
Final questions.</p>
<p><strong>questioner 2</strong>: Is your decision to take a year off
anything to do with the rumours about Jeff and his present leading
lady?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>questioner 2</strong>: Do you believe the rumours?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: It’s really not my business any more. Though I
will say, from my experience, that rumours about Jeff… do tend to be
true.</p>
<p><strong>questioner 3</strong>: Last time you were here, there were
some fairly graphic photographs of you and a young English guy – so what
happened there?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: He was just a friend – I think we’re still
friends.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Yes, the gentleman in the pink shirt.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes – Miss Scott – are there any
circumstances in which you two might be more than just friends?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: I hoped there might be – but no, I’m assured
there aren’t.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: And what would you say…</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: No, it’s just one question per person.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: No, let him… ask away. You were saying?</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Yes, I just wondered whether if it turned
out that this… person…</p>
<p><strong>other journalist</strong>: His name is Thacker.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: Thanks. I just wondered if Mr. Thacker
realized he’d been a daft prick and got down on his knees and begged you
to reconsider, whether you would… reconsider.</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Yes, I’m pretty sure I would.</p>
<p><strong>william</strong>: That’s very good news. The readers of
‘Horse and Hound’ will be absolutely delighted.</p>
<p><strong>jeremy</strong>: Dominic – if you’d like to ask your question
again?</p>
<p><strong>questioner 1</strong>: Yes – Anna – how long are you
intending to stay here in Britain?</p>
<p><strong>anna</strong>: Indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>spike</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>honey</strong>: It was good.</p>
