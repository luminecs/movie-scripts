<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Showtime!</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy? Well
you’ll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into
some sweats.</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Oh my G-D, yes! I wish you would let me rub
those feet. Of course I wouldn’t use my hands. Heh heh heh heh…</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Looks like Victoria just told me her
secret.</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m., first
brassiere sighting… I will pleasure myself to this image for months.
MONTHS I TELL YOU!</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Young Scottie Dunleavy. What unfortunate
timing. You mother was just getting comfy.</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Yes, yes, I’m sure you tied many great knots
today or whatever. Now get out.</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Now what. This simply won’t do.</p>
<p><strong>scottie</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Hello, Scottie. Why don’t you go downstairs
like a good boy and let your mother freshen up.</p>
<p><strong>scottie</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Just a little birdie. A birdie who wants to
see if your mother’s panties match her bra.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Oh my G-D Scottie. Is there a man up our
tree?</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Tell her no. Tell her it’s just a big
bird.</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me. And wear
your bikini.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Welcome!</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Am I in hell?</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Your father wants to see you and
your brothers in the throne room.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin’,
don’t forget the knockin’!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I knew it. He’s finally retiring.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I’ve been waiting on this day for ten
thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>human dartboard</strong>: Aaaah!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: If the old man picks me to take over Hell,
I’ll keep the torture going twenty four seven. No breaks.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Well Dad says it’s the breaks that make the
torture. You have to let people feel a sense of relief.</p>
<p><strong>human dartboard</strong>: Aaaaaaaaaaaah!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Then again, the beauty of Dad retiring is
what he says doesn’t matter anymore.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I’ll take that.</p>
<p><strong>human dartboard</strong>: Was that really necessary?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Hey, how’s Daddy’s little girl doing
today?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Good, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Hey. Hey. Hey. Wanna mind wrestle?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Actually, I’ll take a rain check on0</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Got ya!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yes, you got me…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Got ya, again!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Got me for sure, yes…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Got ya! Now here’s the big finish…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Oh no. Please Cassius…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Aaaaah.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: What are you boys doing?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the
furniture.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Cassius, didn’t I tell you to stay out of your
brother’s mind?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Maybe this will help you remember.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Now everybody sit down.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey, Dad, I’m almost finished laying down my
monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it’s a
masterpiece.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Okay, kid, we’ll listen to it later.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: My dad, your granddad, Lucifer, was thrown out
of Heaven by G-d and rules here in hell for ten thousand years. And
after this ten thousand years had passed, he decided to abdicate his
throne…</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: …to step aside. …and let me become the ruler of
hell. This, as some of you might know, is my ten thousandth year as
Prince of Darkness. So I think the time has come to discuss who will
succeed me.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Knock, knock.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Yes, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: No, no, that’s not what I said. He can keep his
thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Oh, and don’t forget, you’re
shoving a pineapple up Hitler’s ass at four o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: This was a very difficult decision, because I
have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And
Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so…so…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Don’t worry about coming up with anything.
It’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and
careful consideration, I’ve decided that the ruler for the next ten
thousand years is going to have to be…me.</p>
<p><strong>cassius and adrian</strong>: What!?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hallelujah.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I mean…tough break.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: The important thing for the stability of our
rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don’t think
any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom
that comes only with the passage of time.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Dad! This is Hoyashit.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Right. Right. Send him in. I’m sorry, boys.
I’ve got to get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: You sure about this decision, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’m telling you, pal, it’s the right thing to
do.</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Holy schnit!!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: You work your ass off for ten thousand
years, hurting people, helping others hurt people, then you get a
decision like that.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: And he’s dead serious.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: It’s just such a slap in the face.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Um, excuse me, we’re having a private
conversation here.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Yeah, get out of here! Beat it!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Twenty-thousand years ago, Grandpa Lucifer
said, “It is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven.” Well, I’m
getting tired of serving in Hell. We need a place where we can rule.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Oh you wanna be a big man? Bring it on!!
Let’s see what you got!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: That’s what I thought!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Could you concentrate for five seconds?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I am concentrating. Where can we rule?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: What do you think about…Earth?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: We could create our own hell there.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: You saying we go up there and kill
everyone?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Eventually, Cassius. But first we corrupt as
many as we can so that when we do destroy them…</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: …their damned souls will be ours.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: It’s our time, brother.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Hey, what are you doing?!?</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: You can’t go through there. The fire
flows in, not out.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: You know something? You guys suck! You
really suck!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Now that was an experience. “You are only
coming through in waves.” That line blows my mind every time.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I don’t care what kind of mood you’re in at the
start of that song. When it’s over, that mood has been altered. Wow.
Great shit. What’s next?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Well, I thought that after messing with your
head, I’d give you a little kick in the keester.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Who is this, Metal-lick-a?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Metallica, Dad. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I was just playing with you.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’m sorry. After careful consideration, I
regretfully have to decline.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: C’mon, man, I’m just asking for one Superbowl
ring.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul?
You’re too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you,
Mr. Marino.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: You did it for Namath.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go
back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the
beautiful family and all that.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: This is bullshit, man. I’m gonna win the
Superbowl this year, with or without you!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Now you’re talking.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You’re a good devil, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: And I also happen to be a Jets fan.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Your highness, Cassius and Adrian have
escaped from hell. They went through the fire, and they broke it. I
think they took the New York tunnel. I tried to stop them, but they
overpowered me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Oh, boy. Oh boy. Calm down. Get off your
knees.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Thanks for being so understanding, your
worship. You’re the man. You’ve always been the man.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: I’m lucky to get away with just the head
boobs, right?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Coulda been much worse.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: That’s what I’m thinkin’…</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: This is bad, Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: How bad?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’m gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken,
no new souls can get in, which means I’ll start to deteriorate into
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: What’s with all the whoo-whoo noises?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Everything’s fine, pop.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: Last time you said that the renaissance
happened.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Please, pop, just go back to your room.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: Can I take him with me and have sex with
his head?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Sure, pop. Whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Oh, this is gonna be a whole new
lifestyle for me, isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>damned souls</strong>: What’s going on? Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Nothing’s getting through that. The
fire is solid as a rock.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We gotta get this bad boy burning again.
Ideas?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back
through the other way.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: So go get ’em, Dad!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I’m too weak. The process has already
begun.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: So go get ’em, Jimmy!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: I’m just a demon, Nicky. I don’t
got devil blood in me. I’d last two minutes up there with your
brothers.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You’re not saying it’s up to me?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’ve never been to Earth. I’ve never even
slept over at some other dude’s house!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: You’re the spawn of Satan. You got
it in you.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on
Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and
kill my brothers?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Not go. They left together at the
exact same time. They gotta come back together at the exact same
time.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Here. Get them drunk from this. One sip and
they’ll be trapped inside. Once you’ve got both of them, you bring the
flask back through the gate.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Your ol’ man’s got less than a
week.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No. This can’t be happening.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Son, just do your best.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Okay. Earth. The Blue Marble. This doesn’t
look too bad.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: You were gone ten seconds. What
happened?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I got hit by a big light that was attached to
a lot of metal.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: That’s a train, son. Don’t stand in front of
them.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Well, I guess I’m going to have to take a
mulligan on this one.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Please, Nicky, get back up there. Try to
hurry.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Hey, terrific!! Now get off the track and
come with me, shitstains.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: My name’s Beefy. I’m an old friend of your
father’s. He’s asked me to help you out.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I just need to find my brothers and be on my
way, Beefy.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: It’s not gonna be easy. Your brothers can
possess people. So they probably won’t look like themselves. You have to
be suspicious of everyone.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Okay, “bro,” this jig is up… Just get in the
bottle. Just slide right on in there.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: It’s not me, moron.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Oh. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Oh how the Lord loves you. All his
children. He thanks you for your kindness. God bless, Ma’am. The Lord
loves you… The Lord loves you…</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: The Lord does not love you. I sense…pure
evil. You make the Lord very nervous. I’m burning…ahhh. The Devil walks
among us!</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Oh Lord, save us from Hell’s beast!</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Makin’ friends already.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s freezing up here, Beefy.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: You’re on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same
physical needs and limitations a human has. We’ll stop by K-mart. Get
you some warm clothes.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I also have this odd pain in my mid section.
Kind of a hollow feeling…</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: That pain is hunger.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: So far, so good. Now what?</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Put it in your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Move your teeth up and down.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Now you gotta swallow it. Tilt your head back
and let the meat slide down your throat-hole.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey…Popeye’s chicken is ass kickin’!</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: It sure is. Now eat it up. You’re gonna need
your energy.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I got energy up the ying-ying. Let’s get
cracking!</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That’s a pretty brassiere.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Could you maybe not tell anyone about
this?</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: You got it. Could you maybe not tell
anyone about this?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: From now on. I’m just going to avoid all
moving metal objects.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Great. Now your father gave me some deposit
money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: So I found this other joint for you. But
you’re gonna have a roommate.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I know exactly how you feel… The night Reagan
was elected, I said to my mother, “Is this man going to blow up the
world, Mommy?” Then we both cried for like an hour. Somebody’s here.
Call you later.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand
you’re seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village
Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Uh, don’t you want to know what the rent
is?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yes. What is rent?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays
and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will
be off limits.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Off limits.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Right. And as far as household items: we can
share the soap, but we’ll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who
physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn’t have to pay as much as
the other guy. Aren’t you boiling in that outfit?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: It’s like eighty degrees in this hallway. You
from the South?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yeah. The deep South.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Why is that funny?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: You’ll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow.
Don’t forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep
thing?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Yeah, your bedroom is right over there.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: In today’s gospel, the Lord tells us who
we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven… or something
like that. Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible. Moses this.
Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of
hibbity-jibbity. But has he ever really done anything for us? Has he
ever put a Jaguar XJR in my driveway? Has he ever given any of my
enemies the herpes? No. He hasn’t done a damn thing for any of us.</p>
<p><strong>middle-aged woman</strong>: The Lord gave my son the strength
to get off drugs.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Ma’am, I know your son, and believe me, he
was better off on drugs. He’s a bore. At least when he was smoking
hashish, he made me laugh occasionally.</p>
<p><strong>young man</strong>: After we tried for many years, the Lord
finally helped my wife conceive a baby.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: No, your best friend Fitzie helped your
wife conceive a baby. He helped her conceive it all night long.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: How about you, Mr. Mayor? The Lord ever do
anything for you?</p>
<p><strong>mayor</strong>: Well, I wish I could think of something,
Cardinal, but to be honest with you, I can’t. Kind of makes you wonder
if there even is a Lord. If there is any ultimate punishment for our
so-called “sins.” Maybe we should all just have fun and do whatever the
hell we want.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: Amen to that. Let the sin begin!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Oh, this is delicious.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: “Let the sin begins” - that was a good
one.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Well, we must get people sinning if we want
to fill up our New Hell. How are things going down at City Hall?</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: I lowered the drinking age to ten.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Brilliant. This is so much fun. I never want
it to end.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Why should it end? Who’s gonna stop us?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: This is intense! And it happens every day?
Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Look, it’s okay for me to shit the street.
But you gotta use a toilet.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Okay, just point me in the right direction
next time.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Come on, there’s like ten million people in
this city and the clock is ticking.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Well, let’s rock and roll.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Get in the bottle. Dad’s falling apart. You
froze the gate and you’re killing him. Drink!</p>
<p><strong>chinese delivery guy</strong>: I’m not thirsty! I’m not
thirsty!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: just get in the flask!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Adrian and Cassius! You think a kick to the
head is gonna make me throw in the towel? Well, in the immortal words of
Judas Priest, “You got another thing comin’.”</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Bus?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Beast.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: You like that? You think that’s
funny?</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: How about that? You like that?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: All that running and chasing is making the
sleep thing want to come early.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: I think we have to work on narrowing down our
list of suspects. Now I’m going to go check in with some of my contacts
uptown.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Kid’s got a lot of evil in him, just begging
to come out…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Sounds like our devil dance actually worked
this time.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ’Bout time…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There’s our man.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to
the dark side.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s with that guy?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Gotta be one of his disciples or
something.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got
ripped off.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Should we wake him up?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. You do it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Rise and shine, devil guy. Some dude just
stole your shit.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Oh nooooo….</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Which way did he go?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That way.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Iron Maiden live double disc is simply
phenomenal.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Did you check out the dragon mouth?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The Dark Prince is here.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>street vendor</strong>: See something you like, my man?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yes. I would like my flask back.</p>
<p><strong>street vendor</strong>: You callin’ me a thief, my man?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No, I’m just calling you… a guy who has my
flask.</p>
<p><strong>street vendor</strong>: And if that is your so-called
“flask,” how would I have it unless I was, in fact, a thief?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I don’t know?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Yeah, how much for the silver flask there?</p>
<p><strong>street vendor</strong>: Well, that’s a very special item. The
cap itself is one hundred percent plappium. It’s a value is over three
thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Really. Where’s it from?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It was handcrafted in hell by Satan himself
and is only to be used for the capture and containment of my blood
brothers so that the firefall of Hades will burn brightly once
again.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Really. I think we’ll let you keep it then.</p>
<p><strong>street vendor</strong>: Okay, now you gone and done it. You
done messed with my business bitch!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Sir, I would prefer if you didn’t raise your
voice. It’s making my muscles tighten.</p>
<p><strong>street vendor</strong>: Oh, you gonna go all crazy eyes on
me? I’ll show you some crazy eyes. Let’s get busy.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Excuse me, does that flask belong to this
man?</p>
<p><strong>street vendor</strong>: Now you callin’ me a thief? Damn.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Look, I know you come out here and sell
stolen stuff all the time. But today, the guy you stole from just
happened to walk by and bust you. So why don’t you admit today’s not
your day and give him his flask back?</p>
<p><strong>street vendor</strong>: Or what’re you gonna do about it?
Ugly me to death?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: No, but maybe that cop over there might
have something to say.</p>
<p><strong>street vendor</strong>: Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen,
goofy. And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes and find a new corner.
Before I show you what real crazy is.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Fine. I will.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey, mister. I’ll be seeing you in a few
years.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn’t
have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: That’s okay. I get messed with all the time
and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people
take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You think I’m a tourist?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m sorry. I just assumed. Your accent
maybe. Where are you from?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: The South.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yeah. Deep south.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Why are you laughing?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I don’t know, but I like it. Say. Your
glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It’s fun to
look at them.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: My dad’s an optometrist.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: My dad’s in hell, and he’s falling apart.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s really tough when your
parents get older.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: If I don’t save him, I don’t know what I’m
gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Well, I’m sure a nice southern boy like you
will figure something out.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Here, have a Popeye’s. This drumstick ain’t
for beatin’ it’s for eatin’.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: That’s alright. I already ate lunch. I
actually wouldn’t mind getting a Gelati.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Could I come with you to getting a
Gelati?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: If you want to.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Want to? A million angry octopus people
couldn’t hold me back!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: “Octopus people?”</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Uh, it’s a deep south expression.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s freezing my hands.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s not that cold. Here, let me wrap
it.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: Why do you taunt me with your darkness?!
Your evil is stinking up our streets! We’re all gonna die!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: This town is really going to hell lately.
So what part of the city do you live in?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I have an apartment. I don’t remember exactly
where. My dog knows, though.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You have a dog? What kind?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m not sure. I’d ask him, but he’s uptown
talking to his contacts.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Remember, it’s not the size of the boat, it’s
the motion of the ocean.</p>
<p><strong>girl dog</strong>: Just finish.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’d love to have a dog. But I go to school
full time. It wouldn’t be fair to the dog.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: School?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up
I wasn’t much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are
pretty.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What’s that pleasant smell coming from, your
skin?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: My perfume?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: It’s called “Comptoir Sud Pacific.” Which I
think is the French word for coconuts.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Valerie, it feels like there’s a bunch of
butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Sometimes, sure.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Good. I was concerned.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Doesn’t sound very good behind there. I
hope Nicky’s kicking some ass on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: You know, I was the one who created
Hell.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: I know, your wickedness.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: I started slow, though. For years, I was
just giving people hot foots. Actually, you can give all the credit for
Hell to my first wife; she was the inspiration. She was an ugly one,
too. One day, she asked me if I wanted super sex. I said I’ll take the
soup.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: Take it easy there, Chewbacca. In fact, you
look like her mother, except she had more hair.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: You know what was in Hell when I came down
here, Cassius?</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: It’s Stanley, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: Nothing. No mountains. No castles. Looked
like a giant parking lot. It wasn’t even called Hell.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: What was it called, sir.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: Boogerland!</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: That’s nice, Grandpa. Why don’t you just
enjoy the fishing?</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: I can’t enjoy anything. I go fishing. I
catch nothing. I go to orgies, I catch everything…</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: I deserve this!</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I just stole twenty-five bucks off the bar.</p>
<p><strong>kid #2</strong>: How many beers did you have?</p>
<p><strong>kid # 3</strong>: Eight sips.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: I had five! I’m so wasted.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: When an adult goes to Hell, that’s terrific.
But when a child goes… that’s why I’m in this business.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: So you’re saying, make all pants with a
drawstring, then heavier set gals don’t have to feel humiliated by
telling their waist size in front of the whole store?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Basically, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks
for gals with fat ankles.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You know what’s nice about you? You just
seem happy being yourself. You don’t try to act cool.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Thanks much. You know what’s nice about you,
Valerie?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What was that?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I…I don’t know why I just said that. I meant
to say that…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: …I’ve always wanted to have sex with a gross
pig. What do you say we go behind that dumpster, pull our pants down and
see what happens?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You’re a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: You shouldn’t have come here.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Please, get out of my mind!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey, Valerie!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What the hell’s your problem?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad’s
sick.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: He’s sick?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys
left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before
he dies.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: He should have thought of that before he
denied me my birthright.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Well maybe you should go back and talk it
over with him.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: How about this? I stay here enjoying my
Schnapps and you go back.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Adrian, please…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Check this out. The number of the beast.</p>
<p><strong>dan rather</strong>: Reverberations from Arch-Decon
Donnelly’s shocking speech are still being felt throughout the city.
Today, some disgruntled cast members of the play CATS broke the fourth
wall in a most hostile manner.</p>
<p><strong>dan rather</strong>: …But even that does not come close to
what happened today on Live with Regis and Kathy Lee.</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: So I was driving to work today, and some bozo
in a Cadillac cut me off…</p>
<p><strong>kathy lee</strong>: Oh, that’s terrible, Reege…</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: So I followed him…</p>
<p><strong>kathy lee</strong>: You followed him?</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: I followed him all the way downtown, and when
he gets out of the car, I reach under my seat and pull out an aluminum
bat.</p>
<p><strong>kathy lee</strong>: You keep a bat under your seat?</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: Recently, yes! So I run up behind this guy,
and start bashing his brains in with this bat, and it made me feel
happy! Did you ever see THE</p>
<p><strong>kathy lee</strong>: Yes, great movie…</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: I was DeNiro!</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Your brothers are upsetting the balance of
good and evil.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What can I do about it?</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: You can’t do jack shit… unless you learn your
evil powers.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Nobody’s as evil as my brothers. Those dudes
put the wick in wicked.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Go get a soda out of the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: But those are my roommate’s sodas…</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: “But those are my roommate’s sodas…” Does
that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: You have the power to change the cola in that
can into any other liquid - engine oil, bat’s blood, moose piss. You
just have to release the evil within you.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Release the evil?</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: I’m just saying, there’s wickedness in you… I
can tell from your snores.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Release your evil…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I know it’s your living room night. But can I
finish watching the Globetrotters’ game out here? To me it’s classic
Comedia Dellarte.</p>
<p><strong>bill walton</strong>: What an odd game, folks. The powerhouse
85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal run circles around the 0-85
Nationals, seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their
hometown fans.</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: He’s walking, get him a bus!</p>
<p><strong>bill walton</strong>: Oh, another awful call. There is no way
that was travelling.</p>
<p><strong>cornrows</strong>: What’s with all these crazy calls? You
gotta watch that shit, we haven’t lost a game in 53 years.</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: Technical foul!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That guy in the striped shirt snaps his
fingers like someone I know…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It looks like the work of a brother…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: A black guy?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: If it’s Cassius, yes.</p>
<p><strong>globetrotter fan</strong>: Get your head out your ass, ref!
The kids came to see the Globetrotters win.</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: Oh, so you wanna lip off to me? Unsportsmanlike
conduct on the big mouth in the Globetrotter’s shirt. Take ten points
off for the Globetrotters.</p>
<p><strong>bill walton</strong>: In all my years of basketball, I was
never so happy to hear a halftime buzzer. Folk, I’m afraid if the second
half doesn’t get any better, I expect a full scale riot.</p>
<p><strong>court announcer</strong>: It’s time for the Globetrotter’s
halftime half-court heave throw, where one lucky fan will have a shot at
ten thousand dollars!</p>
<p><strong>court announcer</strong>: And if he makes it, everyone in
attendance today will receive a free pizza.</p>
<p><strong>miguel</strong>: I ain’t goin’ out there and taking the shot.
These people have gone crazy.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’ll take the shot.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look who’s back from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Six, six, six, pick up sticks.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: What’s Nicky doing down there?</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Trying to capture his brother in a flask and
preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Did you just talk?</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>court announcer</strong>: You better win these people some
free pizza. Looks like they’re about to start killing each other.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Release the evil.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Okay, too much evil..</p>
<p><strong>bill walton</strong>: I think that ball just blew up. And
yes, my hair is aflame.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Could I get another ball?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I command you not to blow up and go into that
metal circle.</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: Get that crap outta here!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I know you’re having fun, Cassius, but you
gotta come back to Hell.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Look around you, Nicky. We’re in Hell. The
New Hell.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Listen up, New York. Your souls are in great
danger…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Alright, how about this? I get one more shot.
The ref will cover me. I miss it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game. I
make it, he doesn’t ref the second half and we all start conducting
ourselves like decent human beings again.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: And we get free pizza.</p>
<p><strong>bill walton</strong>: I think it’s safe to say we’re all
rooting for this bizarre and hideous looking man.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Nicky! Nicky! Nicky!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You know, Dad got very sick when you
left.</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: I heard. I’m glad he’s dying. It’s my turn
now.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Take him to the hole, Nicky. I mean, woof!
Woof!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Never doubt my skills.</p>
<p><strong>cornrows</strong>: Damn, I gotta learn how to do that.</p>
<p><strong>ref</strong>: That’s nuts. When’d you learn that shit?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Sorry, Cassius. Maybe it was the super devil
juice Dad gave me. HE thought I might need it for just such an
occasion.</p>
<p><strong>regis</strong>: Super devil juice? Give it over. Let’s go
best two out of three.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No. No way. Dad said it was only for me.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Damn you, Nicky! There ain’t no super devil
juice in here!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: So your father’s the devil, you’re a talking
dog sent from Hell, and you guys are who?</p>
<p><strong>peeper</strong>: Just a couple of big fans of Nicky and the
work his Dad does.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: By the way, Nicky. Check this out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s Ozzy trying to say there?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came
straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I command you in the name of the Lucifer to
spread the blood of the innocent.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No wonder your uncle’s so weird…</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I gotta say this cake tastes a little
funny.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Oh, I dumped a fat sack of reefer in the mix.
Tried to spice up the bash.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What’s reefer?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on. One more time.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Please. You got to.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: All right…</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: I used to get baked like this with my first
girlfriend, Heather. We’d get so stoned she would forget I was a
dog.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She was human?</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Actually, she was a sewer rat. Man, that
pissed my parents off.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I dated a Japanese girl once. My parents
disapproved. Not cause she’s Japanese, but cause she was only
fifteen.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m only fifteen…thousand years old.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I was in love one time but she said I wasn’t
financially reliable enough. And she needed that.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: By she, do you mean he?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Busted.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: How you feelin’ over there, Satan Abdul
Jabar?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: A little strange. I can’t stop thinking about
this girl, Valerie.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Why? Did she hurt you? Do you miss her? Need a
shoulder to cry on?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Easy, Liberace.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Oh, would you grow up.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: We had the greatest afternoon of my life
until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I’m
baked out of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Me, too. We’re gonna get going.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You guys want to stay? I have a futon in my
bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s a big pass, Elton John.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We’re going to see Ozzy play at the
Meadowlands, right now. Wanna come, Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No thanks. I’m afraid I wouldn’t be able to
give Ozzy the focus he deserves.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then.
Later on.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: See ya, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: You better snap out of it soon, kid. Cause
we’re going after Adrian tomorrow. Seven AM. Nighty, night.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: That is the most frightening thing I have ever
seen.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Todd. Which way to the Parson’s School of
Design?</p>
<p><strong>sign reads</strong>: “Parson’s School - Student Housing”</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Coconuts…</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You smell like coconuts.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: It’s “Comptoir Sud Pacific.” Makes me feel
like a hula girl. Which is kinda what I’m going for. Wanna come in?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No thanks. I’m looking for a girl named
Valerie who also smells like coconuts.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Valerie Doran? Two floors up, one window
over.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital
tucking.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: I don’t need luck. I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Adrian?</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: Andrew.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Nicky? Oh my G-d. Stay right there.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Oh that stings! My eyes are on fire!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What were you thinking coming here?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m not sure, but it didn’t involve getting
blinded with poison.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Oh my G-d, I’m so sorry!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Valerie?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Are you dead?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I think I’m floating.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Why would you be floating?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I don’t know. Maybe it’s because of your
sweet voice.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Am I supposed to not be freaked out right
now? Because I am.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I can’t see you but I can smell you. And you
make me feel alive in a way I’ve never felt before.</p>
<p><strong>student</strong>: You got the wrong window again, man.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I’m over here, Nicky! To the left.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Look, just because you’re floating doesn’t
mean I’m gonna forget about you giving me the finger.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That wasn’t me. I was being possessed by my
brother, Adrian. He’s the one who call you a gross pig.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: What do you mean, “possessed?”</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Remember when I told you my Dad was in
Hell?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Well, that’s because he’s the Devil. And he
wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine
with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my
dad…</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: … “The Devil?”…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: …to decompose. And I love my Dad very much.
So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I
met you and…well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Okay, now I get that “deep south” joke.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I don’t know if I should believe you.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in
the butterflies.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Okay, I do. Get back up here.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: This is amazing.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: The hellbeast is above us. He’s invading
our skies! We’re all gonna die! We’re all gonna die!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: He’s kind of ruining the mood.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Let me take care of that.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: We’re all gonna die!</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Can we go fly over Central Park?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most
beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: We’re going to Jersey?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: East Rutherford.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I never thought I’d ever see Ozzy live until
he was dead. Please tell me you like metal.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: “Mister Crowley, what’s inside of your
head…”</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: My dog was right. I’m in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Moo ya san jie bay!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What’s going on here?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Ow…what was that for?</p>
<p><strong>bum</strong>: Fifty million dollars.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Release the evil.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a
look.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Been breaking all morning.</p>
<p><strong>dan rather</strong>: At a news conference earlier today,
Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this beleaguered city its latest dose
of bad news. He revealed that the man who caused a sensation at
basketball arena last night is no hero… he is, in fact, a mass
murderer.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I didn’t murder anybody</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Look. You were really high. Things
happen.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian’s
work. I’ve got to find him.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: I think you’re looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: This video shows what he did after
he left the basketball arena yesterday…</p>
<p><strong>guy</strong>: My name’s Nicky, and I’m gonna kill all you
suckers for no reason!</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: Difficult to watch, I know. In
response to this vicious crime, I am authorizing the largest reward in
law enforcement history: fifty million dollars to the person or persons
who bring this man to me.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: This is baloney!</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: He superimposed your head onto
“Scarface.”</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: …which is by far DePalma’s best work…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’m not Nicky. I’m not home! I don’t live
here!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Dude, it’s us. Let us in.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There’s like a total mob scene coming this
way.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I thought for sure I gave ’em the slip.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Looks like they’re following a giant trail of
bug shit.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What’ll we do now, Beefy?</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: I don’t know, this is a little out of my
league.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Come on. Let’s get ’em.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What would your dad do, Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Good idea…kill me.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Dude. Seriously?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yes. I’ll meet you at Grand Central at noon.
Okay. Do me. I command you.</p>
<p><strong>john and peter</strong>: Alright!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That just hurt a lot.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: I’ve always wanted to kill someone. Can I do
it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look at Queen Latifah steppin’ up.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Die, Grandma, die!</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: Royal flush, you lose. Off with the
bra.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: Last time I saw a pair of jugs that big,
two hillbillies were blowing on them.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Dad, Adrian’s got the whole city after me.
He’s always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got
no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear…</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I got no ears! I can’t hear!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Now he’s got no ears! You happy,
Nicky? Your father’s got no ears!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Uh, I’ll do my best, Dad. Do you have any
advice at all for me?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I can’t hear you, Nicky. I can’t hear
anything!</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Check one-two. Check one-two.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Put it back on my head. I’m falling apart
here.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: He’s got ’til midnight tonight,
Nicky. You get your ass back up there. You save your father!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You sure you’re down with this?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Little nervous. Wanna puke.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Looking for the chief.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We know where to find Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: You have what I want?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure do. You got what we want?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Fifty million bones, bro.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: That’s half of it. You get the rest
when I get Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Excellent. But I gotta warn you, man. He’s
not human.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We think he’s the son of Satan.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: Well, then I guess I’ll have to be
extra careful. Now where is he?</p>
<p><strong>bag lady</strong>: Hey, watch it! Who do you think you
are?</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: Emperor of the New Hell.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Where is he? He’s late.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: He’ll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: We’ve been ratted out.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: You guys. That was so uncool.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: We thought the son of Satan would understand
a move like this.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: Okay, take these two outside. I can
handle this.</p>
<p><strong>chief of police</strong>: Wanna see something cool?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Ta-da. So what time is my brother expected
back?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Noon…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: …ish.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: So even though you’re not really the chief,
we still get the rest of the cash, right bro?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: You know what you’ll get? An indescribably
horrific torture administered by demons for the rest of eternity.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But what about the cash? Can we keep it or
what?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Sure, why not?</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Food stamps? They should call ’em “dude
stamps.” Cause ever time I get one, some dude takes it away…</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Hey, studs. I’ll let you make out with me for
a dollar!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No thanks…but we’ll take that bottle of
booze.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Hey…that’s mine.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Beat it, ya freak.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Schnapps…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Peppermint…alright.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wanna hit?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Drink up. Here’s to fifty million clams.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: To the defilement of Earth and the
corruption of its people.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Whatever. Knock it back, grab Nicky and let’s
get outta this hell-hole.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: It is awfully hot down here. How do you
manage to stay so cool?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Weed lowers the body temperature. I read
that…in, uh…er, science magazine.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: This liquid will probably quench my thirst.
Cool me off.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And give you a good buzz.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Or maybe it will trap me inside for all
eternity.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh. No it won’t?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Oh, Nicky, I’ve missed you. Come on out and
say hello…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Urr…uggg…errr…</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I’m calling you out, brother…</p>
<p><strong>john/nicky</strong>: Urrr…uggh… Oww. Adrian, this is very
painful.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Hello, Cassius.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: All right. Let me out.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: You know, New Hell really only needs one new
Satan.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: You mother…</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: But Cassius could use some company for the
rest of eternity. So get in the flask.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Oh, he’s gotta pee.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Run, Beefy! Run!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I won’t drink. You can’t make me.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Of course I can. Drink or she dies. Unlike
you, she won’t come back from where she’s going.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I hear a train coming. Drink.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Don’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I have to, Valerie.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Now that hurt the both of us.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Valerie!!!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: See you in Hell!</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Oh. My. G-d. I can’t believe you’re here.
Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: So excited.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: She really is.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That’s terrific. Now could you ladies point
me to the Black Palace? I should check in with my dad…</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I’m sorry, you’re just so cute.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Do you have any idea where you are right
now?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: The home of eternal damnation, house of
Hades, H.E. double toothpicks…</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Maybe try the opposite of that.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Okay, can I just ask you something? What do
you know about your mom?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: My brothers told me my mother was a mountain
goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: A mountain goat? That’s really sweet.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: My mom wasn’t a goat?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Try an angel.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: An angel?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Wow. What…what did she look like?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Well, she was about six-three, only spoke
Portuguese and had really long grey hair.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m totally busting on you. I’m
your mom.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: I’m sorry, but you just had the sweetest look
on your face.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: You’re gonna be so happy she did that.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: How come you’re not older?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Angels don’t get any older, son.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: I can’t believe you just called him
“son.”</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Oh my G-d. This is so wild.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: I can’t see shit. You’re all still here,
right?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Adrian’s here. You’ll be back to
normal in a jiffy, sir.</p>
<p><strong>dad lips</strong>: Yea! I can’t believe little Nicky came
through.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Where’s Nicky?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: He came with you and Cassius,
right?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I came through that gate alone.</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Sorry, sir, false alarm.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Boooo.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Somebody explain what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: You’ll get nothing out of me.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Perhaps a titty twister will loosen your
lips.</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: The only way to save your dad is for you
and your brothers to pass through the gates at the same time before he
deteriorates completely.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: How much time does Dad have before that
happens?</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Thirty minutes. And then whoever claims
his throne will have unimaginable power.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: All boobs and no balls.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Thirty minutes. Hmmm. I hope you don’t mind
if I take a seat while I wait for you.</p>
<p><strong>dad lips</strong>: Ahhh!</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: I don’t get no respect.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Ten thousand years. And I never once got to
sit here.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Wow. And this is just a little taste of my
power.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Hell’s gonna bust wide open. Demons, get him
out of the chair!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Ah-ah. Not so fast, demons. There are a
couple of million evil souls on Earth ready to be harvested. Anyone
interested?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Are you Adrian and Cassius’ mom, too?</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: No, their mother’s weren’t angels.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I think they were hookers or strippers or
something really porno like…</p>
<p><strong>chubbs</strong>: Holly, Jenna, Christa. Time for your Mambo
lesson.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Oh, Chubbs. I totally spaced. I’m so sorry. I
have company. It’s my son, Nicky. My son. Can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>chubbs</strong>: Wow, that’s terrific.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Nicky, this is Chubbs. He used to be a golf
pro, but up here he’s the dopest dance instructor.</p>
<p><strong>chubbs</strong>: You mambo?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>chubbs</strong>: Remember, it’s all in the hips. It’s all in
the hips.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Where did you meet my father?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and
Hell mixer.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: I remember that night, you had like four
daiquiris.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Try four and a half. At first I totally
didn’t like him.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: He was really conceited.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: But I don’t know, he was funny, he made me
laugh, and I hate to say it but he had a really nice body.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: And that made you want to make a baby with
him?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Well, I really wasn’t thinking about making a
baby at the time!</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Hello….yes, he’s here with me now… I don’t
know if he’s hot, he’s my son, you perv! I’ll call you back… Oh my G-d,
I will call you back, goodbye. That was my friend, Michelle, she says
“hi.”</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Well tell her I said “hi” back.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I’ll call her later.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: You know, we saw you save your girlfriend’s
life.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: That was so cool.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: That’s why you came up to Heaven instead of
Hell. Self-sacrifice automatically gets you here.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: How did you see me?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: We can see what’s going on anywhere on Earth.
Look.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: All these good people have totally been led
astray.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: Show him Central Park.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: There’s like a three day rave goin’ on down
there. No on is going to work anymore.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Welcome to the party. It’s so nice to see
all of you here.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Hey, that’s Dad’s throne! How did Adrian get
that? Is Dad okay?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Let’s see…</p>
<p><strong>dad lips</strong>: I was a good Devil, wasn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: You were the best Devil, boss, the
best Devil!</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>dad lips</strong>: I tried to do some interesting stuff…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: You did amazing stuff!</p>
<p><strong>gatekeeper</strong>: I don’t know how you came up with some
of it.</p>
<p><strong>dad lips</strong>: Really? That means a lot to me.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: Oh my G-d. He looks gross.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I can’t believe I did it with him.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I’m very proud of you. You’ve taken to sin
with minimal prompting.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: You’re acting as if there is no Heaven or
Hell.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Well, I have some news.</p>
<p><strong>cardinal</strong>: There is most definitely a Hell! And
you’re all going there when you die! Which will happen in about fifteen
minutes.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: We really are gonna die!</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: This don’t look good.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Can’t Beefy use his penis powers to get us out
of this?</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: They castrated him. He can’t shoot arrows, he
can’t piss smoke.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: I can’t screw. I can’t screw.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Valerie’s crying!</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: She’s so nice.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: She goes to Parson’s, right?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I would totally love to go there. But I hear
it’s really hard to get in.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta
help everybody.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Yeah, you do…</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: At the stroke of midnight, my father will be
completely deteriorated. And all of your souls will be mine.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Soon you will see things more horrible than
you can even imagine.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Not that horrible, but still pretty bad.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: So while we wait, for your enjoyment, I
bring you a dear sweet man and an international icon…Henry Winkler!</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Covered in bees!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and
smarter than me.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you
have something he doesn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: A speech impediment?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: No, you have the inner light. You can totally
use it. It’s the best power of all. And in case you get in real bad
trouble, G-d told me to give you this.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I’m not a hundred percent on that. G-d said
when the time comes, you’ll know what to do.</p>
<p><strong>christa</strong>: G-d’s so smart.</p>
<p><strong>jenna</strong>: The smartest.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Well, goodbye…for now. Can I just do
this?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: That was such a Mom thing, wasn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: Totally.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would
it be okay if I called you Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: It would be so okay.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause
I’m gonna rock that town like a hurricane.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: You’re already there…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Release…the good.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Release the good…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Release the awesome.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Put it in your mouth and let it slide down
your throat-hole.</p>
<p><strong>demon</strong>: Popeye’s chicken is ass kickin’!</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: One thing I really regret is never having
experimented sexually.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen
Burner? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He means getting it on with someone like that
freak.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: His name is Andrew. I know that guy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Of course you do, Tommy Tune.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: You know, from this angle, you’re kind of
cute.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You think so? Why don’t you come a little
closer and I’ll show you a better angle.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Yummy.</p>
<p><strong>todd</strong>: Oh my G-d, he just opened his mouth and
swallowed that spit.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: That turn you on there, RuPaul?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Keep it up and I just might make you my
Queen for a night or two.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want a queen? Got one right here.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Little Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Adrian, I’m asking you nicely, in the name of
all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Is this a joke?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No. It’s the inner light. And with it we can
defeat anything you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>reformed demon</strong>: It’s true!</p>
<p><strong>another reformed demon</strong>: It’s not true?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Okay, Adrian, you’ve left me with no
choice.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Love lifts me up where I belong.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Not bad, little brother. Let’s see what
you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Enough. I’m going to kill you with my bare
hands.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: I totally had to do that.</p>
<p><strong>all the girls</strong>: Yah you did.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Now I’m asking you nicely, get in the
flas…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Now will you get in the flask?</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Absolutely not.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: A little help over here.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Henry!</p>
<p><strong>henry winkler</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: Goodbye, Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Come on in, bro.</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Thank you, Nicky. Cause now I’m gonna bust
Adrian’s head wide open.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: I was going to let you out, eventually,
Cassius. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Sole ruler of Hell and Earth is what I heard
him keep saying.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Nicky!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That was Cassius!</p>
<p><strong>demon</strong>: Kill him, Adrian.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Where’d a sweet Southern boy learn to fight
like that?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: From my dad’s side of the family.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: What? No tongue?</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Nicky. Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: You gotta fly out…I know you can do it. Do
it for the butterflies.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Butterflies…</p>
<p><strong>ozzy</strong>: Hello, New York.</p>
<p><strong>john and peter</strong>: Ozzy.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Put him in, Ozzy.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Grand Central, Nicky. Start running.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: He’ll never make it.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: You gotta kill yourself.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I’ll just go to Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: No if you do something bad right before you
die.</p>
<p><strong>henry winkler</strong>: Aw, man, not again.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Sorry, Henry. Release the Evil.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Do me.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Okay, you just saw my son save the universe.
Right?!</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You came through, Nicky.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I came through for you, Mom and the
butterflies, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: You’re back in Hell now, kid. There’s no
butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What about you and Grandpa and everyone in
Hell?</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a
time and it’s never stopped hurting. That’s right, you heard me, Holly.
I’m still in love with you.</p>
<p><strong>angel</strong>: Oh my G-d. He’s totally talking about me.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: And don’t think I forgot about how crazy you
get after a few daiquiris.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: That guy is still a horn dog.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Listen, I got down low. Your mom’s got up high.
You take care of the middle.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue,
this will always be my…home sweet home…</p>
<p><strong>jimmy the demon</strong>: Sorry to interrupt guys, but it’s
time for Hitler’s punishment.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: Let me handle that.</p>
<p><strong>lucifer</strong>: And I’m not using a pineapple this
time.</p>
<p><strong>adrian</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>cassius</strong>: Don’t do it!</p>
<p><strong>hitler</strong>: Holy Schnit!</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Oh…what an uncommonly beautiful baby.</p>
<p><strong>valerie</strong>: Thank yo.</p>
<p><strong>lady</strong>: Such a little angel.</p>
<p><strong>beefy</strong>: Only a quarter, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Zachariah, say you’re sorry.</p>
<p><strong>baby zachariah</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>preacher</strong>: He has spilled his seed! He is
multiplying! Beware the progeny of the unholy union! We’re all gonna
die!</p>
