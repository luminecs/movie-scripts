<p><strong>terry hayes</strong>: GEORGE MILLER BRIAN HANNANT</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: The vision dims and all that remains
are mememories. They take me back - back to the place where the black
pump sucked guzzolene from the earth…</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: And I remember the terrible battle we
fought - the day we left that place forever…</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: But, most of all, I remember the
courage of a stranger, a road warrior called Max. To understand who he
was you must go back to the last days of the old world …</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: … when, for reasons long forgotten,
two mighty warrior nations went to war …</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …and touched off a blaze which engulfed
them all.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …For without fuel they were nothing. They
had built a house of straw …</p>
<p><strong>businessmen</strong>: Sell! Sell! Sell!</p>
<p><strong>seven sisters petroleum</strong>: “Fueling The World”</p>
<p><strong>politician</strong>: Stage three of the national emergency is
effective immediately, citizens are warned …</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: People stopped in the streets and
listened: for the first time they heard the sound of silence.</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: Their world crumbled …</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: And only those mobile enough to
scavenge, brutal enough to pillage would survive.</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: At last, the vermin had inherited the
earth.</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: And in this maelstrom of decay,
ordinary men were battered and crushed…</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: …men like the Warrior Max…</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: who in the roar of an engine, lost
everything …</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: And became a shell of a man. A burnt
out, desolate man, a dead man, running from the demons of his past. A
man who wandered far away…</p>
<p><strong>narrator v/o</strong>: And it was out here in this blighted
place, that he learned to live again…</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Don’t hurt that snake!</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Put him back… gently!</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Sounded like a big V-8 to me. I guess
I got myself some guzzolene.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The car’s booby-trapped. Touch those tanks and
BOOM! You’ll blow yourself apart.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Drop the weapons… Now back up.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: You’re quick, I’ll give you that.
Never seen a man beat a snake. Never. Reflexes, that’s what you’ve got.
Me? I’ve got brains.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Now, where’s this booby-trap?</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: A fella - a quick fella - might keep a
weapon under there.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Then I’d have to pin his head to the
panel.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There’s one more.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Oh no! You don’t play me the fool.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Gas! Petrol! Guzzolene! Listen!
Hundreds… thousands of gallons… as much as you want …</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Not far. Ten… maybe twenty miles.
Pumping it they are. Refining it. Kachunk… kachunk… kachunk… Day and
night. A huge tanker full.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Balls!</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: It’s there, you betcha… I’ll tell you
straight though - it’s not self service. It’s under guard. Too hard for
me. But a man with your ingenuity … Jesus I reckon…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Kill me, and you’ll never find
out.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Well… I never said it’d be easy.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Okay, there it is. If anyone can get.
in, I know it’s gonna be you. Me … I’ve gotta feed the snakes.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: A man lives by his word, I reckon. And
I’ve kept mine …</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Look! We had a deal: I show you the
gas - You let me go.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The contract was I wouldn’t kill you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I reckon you got a bargain… Don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: What’s up!!</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Jesus! He’s gonna kill her.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Hey! What about me?!!</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Thank you. Thank you…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Let’s get this straight. I’m doing it ’cos I
need fuel.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: As much as you want. Take me back … don’t
let me die.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Stay alive! Stay alive!</p>
<p><strong>big rebecca</strong>: Nathan! Nathan! It’s Nathan.</p>
<p><strong>big rebecca</strong>: Nathan! God have mercy.. What a
waste.</p>
<p><strong>big rebecca</strong>: Look at your handiwork! They didn’t
have a chance …</p>
<p><strong>the curmudgeon</strong>: You all heard me. I warned him
didn’t I? Madness, I said.</p>
<p><strong>warrior woman</strong>: Pity your name wasn’t pulled out the
hat.</p>
<p><strong>curmudgeon</strong>: We can escape, take our petrol, he said.
How? I said. Get a prime mover, he said …</p>
<p><strong>curmudgeon</strong>: … And there’s the result! Madness I
said!</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: Where did you find him?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Two, three miles away… left for dead… next to
his car. We made a deal.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: Three other vehicles. Did you see
them?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Running hard to the south-west. In heaps of
trouble. Listen: he said if I brought him in, you’d give me gas. There’s
no time…</p>
<p><strong>quiet man</strong>: There was a woman… in the car …</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: She’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>quiet man</strong>: How? What did they do?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It was quick.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I saw a man in trouble and I brought him in.
And now I just want to get out of here. Give me my gas.</p>
<p><strong>warrior woman</strong>: For all we know, he’s one of them.
Give him nothing.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We had a contract…</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: I don’t know who you are, or what
happened. But if you had a contract, it was with him. And it died with
him.</p>
<p><strong>warrior woman</strong>: Be thankful, you’re still alive.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: I gotta hand it to you. Some machine…</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Would’ve been a shame to blow it up. The
last of the pursuit specials. It’s history, that’s what it is. A piece
of history…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s OK, Dog. Just do as they say…</p>
<p><strong>the broken victim</strong>: Hold your fire. He wants to talk…
he comes in peace… for Godsake! Hold your fire…</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Poor mongrels … not one got through.</p>
<p><strong>toadie</strong>: Greetings from the Lord Humungus The Warrior
of the Wasteland! The Ayatollah of Rock and Roller.</p>
<p><strong>humungus</strong>: I am told you wish to take the gasolene
out of the wasteland…</p>
<p><strong>defiant victim</strong>: Shoot! Shoot him! While you’ve got
the chance …</p>
<p><strong>humungus</strong>: You set out this morning to find a
vehicle. A vehicle strong enough to haul that fat tank of gas …</p>
<p><strong>toadie</strong>: You see! There is no escape. The Humungus
rules the wasteland…</p>
<p><strong>defiant victim</strong>: Don’t give them the gas! Blow it
up!</p>
<p><strong>toadie</strong>: I got it! I got it!</p>
<p><strong>wez</strong>: There’s been enough talk. I’m going in!</p>
<p><strong>humungus</strong>: Be still my dog of war. I understand your
pain. We’ve all lost someone we love … But, we do it my way. Fear is our
ally. After, you can have your revenge.</p>
<p><strong>humungus</strong>: There has been too much violence … too
much pain. None here is without sin. But, I have an honourable
compromise. Give me the gasoline and I’ll spare your lives. Just walk
away. I will give you safe passage in the wasteland … Walk away and
there will be an end to the horror …</p>
<p><strong>humungus</strong>: You have one full day to decide!!</p>
<p><strong>quiet man</strong>: We’ll never walk away. Never!</p>
<p><strong>big rebecca</strong>: Don’t be a fool! It’s our only
chance…</p>
<p><strong>big rebecca.</strong>: It’s simple … we trade the gas for our
lives.</p>
<p><strong>warrior woman</strong>: No! We’ve worked too hard.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Walk out there? They’d slaughter us… run us
down for sport.</p>
<p><strong>big rebecca</strong>: Don’t listen to them! It’s bad enough
the lunatics are running the asylum. Don’t let them throw away the
key.</p>
<p><strong>curmudgeon</strong>: It’ll be alright. I’ll talk to this
Humungus. He’d never hurt an asthmatic old man.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: I’m sure they’ll find a use for you.</p>
<p><strong>lusty</strong>: I’d rather be out there, on my back alive,
than in here, on my back dead.</p>
<p><strong>big rebecca</strong>: He promised us safe passage. He gave
his word.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo’s voice</strong>: And let us suppose he keeps it
…</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: …and we walk out of here with our lives.
What then? Do we wander the wasteland - scavenging. Wake up one morning
and find we’re just like them - savages.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: Is that what you want? I don’t. I came
out here and I found that pump. I built that plant and ploughed that
field. Why? Because we are human beings. We must maintain our dignity.
We are not barbarians …</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: I made one mistake - I waited too long…
thinking we could survive here. We can’t. But, as frightened as we all
are let’s not forget one thing.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: That is more than just a tank of fuel.
It’s our lifeline, our passport to a place beyond the reach of men on
machines.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: No! I don’t know how we’re gonna get
there. But the first step is to defend that fuel. I won’t surrender it
to anyone. I stay! Alone if I have to…</p>
<p><strong>big rebrcca</strong>: Words! Just words. You’re going to die,
for a pipedream.</p>
<p><strong>warrior woman</strong>: No! We fight for a belief - I
stay!</p>
<p><strong>lusty</strong>: I really wished it had worked. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>angie</strong>: We stay!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Two days ago I saw a vehicle that’d haul that
tanker.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You wanna get out of here. You talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: So that’s my offer. I deliver a prime mover and
in return you give me my black car and as much gas as I can carry. All I
need right now is three Jerry cans of diesel and five gallons of
petroleum.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Think of it as a down payment.</p>
<p><strong>warrior woman</strong>: And that’s the last we’ll ever see of
him.</p>
<p><strong>big rebecca</strong>: What have we got to lose?</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: I knew it. I knew it’d work. Lethal, those
snakes. Lethal. Born killers. The snake’s fangs, my brains. Lethal I
tell ya …</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: Don’t think you’re gonna get any of this.
Cos you’re not. It was my snake. I found it. I trained it. And I’m gonna
eat it.</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: You mean? All this time? Jesus, that’s
dishonest!</p>
<p><strong>captain</strong>: How do we know that one’s not a dud.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: There’s only one way to find out.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: What sort of deals that?! I’m running
on empty!</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: You can’t just dump me! Think of us as
partners.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s up to you. Fly a kite, or follow me back.
Maybe they’ll throw some gas your way.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: What sort of deal’s that?! I’m running
on empty!</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Watch your tyres! Turn left!</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: Open the gate!</p>
<p><strong>lone wolf</strong>: The gate’s open! Follow me in!</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Don’t lose it now! We need the
fuel!</p>
<p><strong>wez</strong>: The gate! The gate! Move!!</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: OK! OK! Let’s go. We leave tonight!</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: We got a hole through the radiator - into
the timing case. Gonna take at least 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: You’ve got twelve.</p>
<p><strong>warrior woman</strong>: I want you to know… that was a very
brave thing you did…</p>
<p><strong>curmudgeon</strong>: … and tell me, son, this machine of
yours - it takes two … does it?</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: er… possibly.</p>
<p><strong>curmudgeon</strong>: See! I told ya. I said he was
leaving.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: I don’t have time for thanks. You know
what you did out there and what it means to us. Come with us, MAX. Drive
the tanker.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: We had a contract. I did my job, I got my car
and I got my gas. End of story.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: It doesn’t have to be - we’ll make a new
contract. I can offer you a chance to rebuild your life. I can offer you
a future.</p>
<p><strong>curmudgeon</strong>: You gotta come. Look!</p>
<p><strong>greetings from the</strong>: SUNSHINE COAST</p>
<p><strong>curmudgeon</strong>: This is where we’re going. Two thousand
miles away. Bloody paradise. Fresh water… plenty of sunshine… nothing to
do but breed…</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: What are you looking for out there? How
long do you expect to survive, scavenging day to day? You’re no
different from them…</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: … vultures, maggots. Don’t you see?
There is a better way!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Yeah. I tried it once! Now forget it, ’cos I
never get involved. I’m leaving. I leave tonight.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: You see! That’s the alternative! Men
feeding on men.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: I know you’re afraid darlin’… But I’ll
let you into a secret, sweetheart. I’m afraid too.</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: Co on! Go! Just another mercenary!</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: I just want you to know that I don’t
agree with them.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: I don’t think you’re a coward. A bit
stupid maybe - but not a coward. Where else you gonna find what we’ve
got here? Food… fuel … clean women.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Men, too, if that’s your inclination.
Jesus! All we’ve got to do is get away from that Humungus. With you
driving the tanker, we can do it! I know you can. I saw you out there.
Stay with us Max. Drive the tanker.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I haven’t got time to explain. Just believe me
- I’ve got everything I want.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Good luck tomorrow. I hope you make it.</p>
<p><strong>gyro captain</strong>: Thanks. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get out. Scat! Go back.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You’re a fine kid, but you can’t come. You’ve
gotta learn - don’t get close to people. It can churn you up …</p>
<p><strong>wez</strong>: Don’t waste him. If he’s alive… I want him.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: It’s defensible. We can refuel
there.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: But! Only give us until sunset. If we
haven’t made it by then, keep going!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’ll drive the tanker …</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Until you’re clear of trouble …</p>
<p><strong>curmudgeon</strong>: He’s gotta be joking!</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: Look at you.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: But I’m still the best you’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: You’ll need these …</p>
<p><strong>mechanic</strong>: I sweated blood on this mother. And no
bastard’s gonna make me go in no lousy bread van.</p>
<p><strong>humungus</strong>: The tanker! All on the tanker!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: No! The other way!!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Get back! For Chrissakes!</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: Jump! It’s finished. Jump!</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: Jump!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The Kid?!</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: Forget it! Jump!</p>
<p><strong>second mohawker</strong>: All this and no guzzolene.</p>
<p><strong>wez</strong>: I know where there’s guzzolene.</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: We’ve done it! I thought it’d be
impossible. But we’ve done it!!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What about the Kid?!</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: We’ve won! Don’t you see? The fuel was
with the others. It’s already at Powder River.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What happened to the boy?!</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: We’ve gotta keep going. It’s our only
chance.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The Kid?</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: I had to leave him… he was pinned to the
rig…</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: You left him there? With them? Alive?</p>
<p><strong>pappagallo</strong>: There was nothing I could do.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Pappagallo led us north… to safety - to a
place in the sun… In the tenth year, nurturing his vision of a new
world, he died felling timber.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The Captain and the Girl waged war for
years… together they raised eight children…. And as for me…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: … in the fullness of time, I became the
leader - the chief of the Great Northern Tribe…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: As for the Road Warrior… That was the last
we ever saw of him. He lives now… Only in our memories…</p>
