<p><strong>revised</strong>: October 19, 1995</p>
<p><strong>clicks on, 6</strong>: 30 am; CLASSICAL MUSIC now DUELS with
the TV report. HAND-ANNOTATED PAPERWORK and STOCK READOUTS cover a NIGHT
TABLE, where the ringing multi-line TELEPHONE JOINS the cacophony.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Carol from the museum called. She’s sending
architect’s sketches of the wing…</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: That Business Week reporter called again–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Tell him to fuck himself. Nicely.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: –and, um, somebody who identified himself as,
um, P.P. Willy.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: Sorry, I figured it was a crank, but he swore
you’d know who he was. He wanted to meet you for lunch, I told him you
had appointments all–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Cancel. Cancel the whole afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: But you–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Do it. Did he leave a number?</p>
<p><strong>maria</strong>: No. He just said he’d be at Leo’s in the
Haight. At noon.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: That’s all, Maria.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Can I take your order?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I haven’t seen the menu.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh, right. Here, see ya.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: An iced tea, please–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yo, Sky. Happy birthday.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Thanks, “Pee-pee.” I never get tired of
that.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Well… long time.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Yeah, since Mom died– what, five years? So
how you been?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Business as usual…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How’s Elizabeth? Any kids?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: A little girl.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Congrat–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: It’s not mine, she married a pediatrician
in Sausalito.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re divorced… Too bad, she was actually
interesting.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: She stopped drinking, I guess getting rid
of me was the 13th step.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So you’re all alone in the House of Pain.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I redecorated. Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: All over. Nowhere in particular. Didn’t your
fucking gumshoes keep you informed of my every movement?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I called them off two years ago, David.
You’d kicked the heroin, you’d left the ashram, you were windsurfing
somewhere in Central America…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s gorgeous down there… you should go
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Look, are you in trouble, is there
anything you need? You can’t have gone through the trust fund…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s not why I’m here, Sky, I just wanted
to see you… I even brought a gift, for a change.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You didn’t bake me a cake, did you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You can’t still be mad about the hash
brownies…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Happy birthday, bro.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What is this.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s a bomb. Open it!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Consumer Recreation Services. OK…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I can’t tell you very much about it, that’d
ruin the surprise. Just promise me you’ll give ’em a call.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just call ’em. OK look, it’s simple, really.
They entertain you.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Is this an escort service?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: No, it’s nothing like that. They’re a
business, they’re for real… They guarantee just one thing– you won’t be
bored.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They make your life fun.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Fun.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’ve heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Just a cheesebur… how’d you find this
place?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Old connection used to meet me here. So you
gonna call ’em?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You know, David, this is sweet, but it’s
an awfully busy time, I’m in the midst of a delicate liquidation–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: “A delicate liquidation,” God, you would do
this…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: David–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: We can’t get together once without you making
me feel like shit. That’s important to you, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Forget about it, don’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Are you still on medication…?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You guys know what you want?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I just thought you’d like it. I did, it was a
blast, best thing that ever happened to me. And for your information,
I’m not on anything anymore, I’m not even seeing a shrink, I’m in a
better place than I’ve ever been, I’m even happy– but that’s something
else I wouldn’t be able to explain to you.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: OK, OK, I’ll give them a call…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Look, take a pill. Just be normal for
thirty seconds and tell me what this is. I hate surprises.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Van Orton.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Eleven forty, you almost didn’t make
it.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Oh, the usual, big party, circus clowns,
naked lady in a cake…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’m just fine. How are you?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Hm? Just another birthday, another year
closer to death.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Oh that’s right, I guess he was 38, wasn’t
he? I hadn’t thought about it, to tell the truth, but thank you for the
reminder.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I honestly don’t know, but it’s a nice
change of pace from talking to your attorneys. So, still working at the
hospice?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Great, that’s great. Well, give my regards
to Dr. Mel and the baby–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Really. Congratulations– two kids, an
official nuclear family, you must be very happy.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Well, you deserved someone who wanted the
same things you did–</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Are you? Happy?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Speaking of little brothers, I saw David
today.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: He asked about you. He’s on a new kick,
some personal improvement cult. I’m gonna check it out, I’m sure he’s
getting fleeced again.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Right. Well, thanks again for calling,
Elizabeth, take care.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Mm, good luck, bye.</p>
<p><strong>bernard shaw</strong>: –for the residents of the Crescent
Heights project, a truly tragic day is over at last–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’ll drink to that.</p>
<p><strong>bernard shaw</strong>: –up next, the latest in sports. For
all of us here at CNN, thank you for watching–</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Is this Consumer Recreation Services? I
have an appointment, the name’s Van Orton.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Hm… I don’t seem to–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Schuyler Van Orton, I called last
week.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Problem?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: This gentlemen says he has an
appointment, but…</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Van Orton, huh? I’ll take him. Jim
Feingold, v. p. in charge of engineering and data analysis.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Sorry about the chaos, we’re still in the
process of moving… follow me, I’ve got an office around here
someplace.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: I can’t remember the last time I ate in a
restaurant, all I do is work…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I know what you mean. Look– what is all
this?</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Application, MMPI and TAT tests, financial
statement… Want some? Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown… The tests serve a
threefold purpose. First off, are you right for us? Are we right for
you? Unfortunately, there’s a limited number of slots–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Let’s back up here–</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: B, we need an idea of your abilities and
limitations, what turns you on, and off. Numero tres, our insurance
company requires it. You’re familiar with our service, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Not at all. What are you selling?</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Well… it’s a game.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: A game.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Recharges the batteries, gets you off the
treadmill, it’s an experience. Sort of a– vacation for the guy who’s
been everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: This really doesn’t sound like my sort
of–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What’s so amusing?</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Nothing. I know who you are. You’re David
Van Orton’s brother, he got you in here.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: So.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: David was– impressive, one of the better
I’ve seen. But frankly, I can see you’re not the type.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: The type.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: You know, a player.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’m not a player.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: I don’t mean anything personal by it– I
know you’re an important guy, powerful guy, you’re used to being on top.
It’s just, this isn’t for everyone. Not everyone can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What kind of fu– game is this?</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: The ultimate fucking game. I wish I could
tell you more, but it’s different every time. Thanks for coming in–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’m not an idiot. I see what you’re doing.
First the vague yet intriguing pitch, then I’m supposed to feel like my
manhood’s in question because I’m not up for, what, some motivational
role-playing fantasy nonsense–</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Interesting, you don’t know the first
thing about it but you’ve already decided what it is… Listen, I don’t
wanna waste any more–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Please, Jim, cut the hard-to-get shit.
I’ve got the afternoon free, I’ll take your silly tests.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Ms. Nelson, are you busy? We need someone
to run Mr. Van Orton.</p>
<p><strong>ms. nelson</strong>: This way, sir…</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: I’ll catch up with you after the
physical.</p>
<p><strong>a. x-close</strong>: A #2 pencil FILLS IN box after box on a
long MMPI form. CLOSE on a couple of these: “I sometimes hurt animals… I
feel guilty when I masturbate…” each followed by TRUE and FALSE
boxes.</p>
<p><strong>b. a white-walled room</strong>: Schuyler concentrates on a
drawing held by a stone-faced PSYCHOLOGIST, a TAT test; he laughs as he
speaks into a tape-recorder, analyzing the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>c. x-close</strong>: The DRAWING, a large ant with an apron
feeding a TV dinner to a human child. The card moves just as we register
it to reveal another DRAWING of a smiling man toppling backwards in a
chair, perched on the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p><strong>d. a lab</strong>: Electronic MONITORS and PRINTERS record
Schuyler’s EEG and EKG. We see him on a doctor’s table, wearing a
medical gown with the CRS logo. He’s hooked up to the wires, a female
TECHNICIAN studying the readouts while a NURSE takes his blood
pressure.</p>
<p><strong>e. x-close</strong>: The traveling trace of intersecting
colored waves.</p>
<p><strong>f. a darkened room</strong>: Schuyler in FG, still in the
gown, watches a screen as images FLASH– geometric SHAPES, WORDS, PHOTOS.
His finger hovers over a bank of three buttons, he presses different
ones from time to time. There’s a MIRROR to one side of the room–</p>
<p><strong>g. x-close</strong>: A COMPUTER SCREEN shows green columns of
NUMBERS– SCHUYLER’S NAME is steady at the top of the screen, with an
account number. CAMERA MOVES FROM THE SCREEN to show an unseen COMPUTER
OPERATOR watching Schuyler through the one-way glass.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: David, you suck.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Sorry to keep you waiting, a client’s head
exploded… You can get dressed, we’re done.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Looks promising at this point. You test
well, you’re in decent shape for someone in your tax bracket… Hm, some
resistance to the psych questions, but we got the general idea…</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: We design the game around your schedule,
you’re free to give it as much or as little time as you wish. And of
course, you can call it quits at any point.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: This was actually a gift. Did my brother
pay in advance?</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: You’d have to ask our billing department…
the price varies. But our service comes with a guarantee. If you’re not
satisfied, there’s no charge. And we’ve never had an unsatisfied
customer…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You mean dissatisfied.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Mm, that’s right– you’re a left- brain
word fetishist.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I get that all the time.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: So I’m supposed to sign up for a game when
I don’t know the rules, I don’t know the object, I don’t know how much
it costs…</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: It’s a leap of faith. But at this stage,
there’s no commitment– we just need to process your application. And if
you qualify, you’re in for the ride of your life. What have you got to
lose?</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Initials– initials– sign here.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: In blood. —Just kidding.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Very good, Mr. Van Orton. Please, keep the
pen.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: When can I expect to hear–</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: We’ll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: David, where the hell are you, we were
supposed to meet at the club–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, shit, sorry Sky, I spaced– next
Tuesday?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’ll be in Seattle.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Buy you lunch soon as you get back, I
swear…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I checked out CRS by the way–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hey, great, you gonna go for it?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Haven’t decided yet…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: –like fuckin’ wildfire, just opened an office
in Frisco here–</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: I played my game in New York… What do you
think John, will CRS ever go public?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not likely, would you?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: New members?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: This round’s on me.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: …last time I played Pebble, I swore I’d never
pick up a club again…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Great thing about golf, the way it takes
you out of your life… Speaking of games– I take it you two are familiar
with CRS…?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh-oh. Time to piss…</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Why do you ask, Schuyler?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I couldn’t help overhearing–</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: We don’t usually talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I only bring it up because, well, I
recently tested for it.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Did you? Kudos.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I just wasn’t sure if they’re for real,
whether it’s worth it–</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Worth it… Gee, I dunno… they did save my
fucking life…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Sorry?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Look, I don’t know you, you don’t know me,
but… I hit a certain point, nothing meant anything. My work, the wife
and kids– hell with ’em, I was sick of it all, y’know? But CRS… they
changed everything. “Are they for real?” Who cares, maybe nothing is. To
reality.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: C’mon Pete.</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Good luck, pal. You’ll need it.</p>
<p><strong>plympton</strong>: Excuse me. Excuse me! Postponing the
Baer-Grace meeting is out of the question. Schuyler gets on a plane for
Washington tomorrow morning at seven with every contract, every side
agreement, the complete closing package!</p>
<p><strong>lawyer</strong>: But there’s simply no–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No is not an option. If you fail to
recognize that, I’ll find ten other law firms in the yellow pages that
can get the job done–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Yes, who is this?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What?! How did you get this number?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’m in a meeting–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: –so I don’t have time for– Excuse me, what
was that?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: …Why?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: This is absurd–</p>
<p><strong>plympton</strong>: Bad news, Sky?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No, nothing. Sorry, Bob. So were there any
more questions, or may I assume it’s under control…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Hello! What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Wonderful. You OK? You dead?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Shit, shit, shit…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Fuckers!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Yeah, this is pretty impressive but
listen–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: My name is Schuyler Van Orton, my game
just started. Look, this is a bad time, I’m about to leave town–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’m expecting a package with some
documents. Did it arrive?</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: Ay mon, got sometin’ fo you mon.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Get lost, pal.</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: No can do.</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: You want what I got, mon.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: Dere are many paths to enlightenment, but
you must choose one and stay on it– or you will surely die in the
darkness–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’ll take my chances.</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: Jah Love mon, dat’s the key, dat’s the
key…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Alan! What’s wrong with a car–</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: I’m giving you an overview of our little
operation! You gotta see the new breed of high yield saplings…</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: How was your flight?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: You’ve been planning this for months, haven’t
you? Sandbagging me like this, selling us for scrap…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: BG lumber is not profitable and hasn’t
been for years, my duty is to salvage what I can. These are the closing
papers, in ten minutes I’m going to present the sale terms to the
shareholders and elect my new management team.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: I was friends with your father, you bastard, I
watched you grow up, and now you kick me in the balls–</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: That’s not how you play the game.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: You could’ve fucking told me!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What game?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Never mind… we’ll just have to go with the
earlier draft.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Can’t find your keys?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Where are they.</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: Up your ass?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Up my ass, very funny…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I don’t– OK. OK, you’re with CRS…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: So the game, it’s just a screen, to blow
this deal…</p>
<p><strong>baer</strong>: I’m not following you.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Like hell you aren’t. How did you get my
brother involved, that’s unforgivable.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Um… sorry to interrupt. We’ve been having
some trouble with this fax, so they re-sent the material. It’s all OK
now.</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Oh and Mr. Van Orton– are these yours?
The pilot found ’em on the floor of the chopper…</p>
<p><strong>insert note</strong>: It actually reads “CBS CALLED.” a
Post-It note covered the base of the B before, making it look It
continues “Re: Interview with Alan B. on Sun…”</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Everything seems to be in order. Please
disregard my last comments. The shareholders meeting is about to get
underway… Shall we?</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: Shit mon sorry oughta pay more
attention.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Listen, I quit.</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: Free at last… you won’t be needin’ this,
then.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No, cretin. I’m quitting the game.</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: Wha’s that, mon? I didna hear you.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I said I– shit!</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: Help, help! The mon is crazy!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: Got something better.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I realize you’re just some bit player, but
I’d like you to get a message to your employers. This bullshit is
interfering with my work, it’s breaking my concentration and I can’t
allow that to happen–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: If I take that stupid key, will you give
me back my briefcase and go away?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What the fuck am I doing?!</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: Don’ worry, mon, it’s a world a shit.</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: So try looking at it through rose-
colored glasses… here.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I told you, this is over! I quit!</p>
<p><strong>rasta man</strong>: They all say that at first.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I was supposed to meet someone here, a
David Van Orton– I was wondering if he’d left a message.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: ’Fraid not, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Fuck me!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Oh this is cute. Very cute.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: What happened here, you OK?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It was an accident–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No it wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What’s next, a giant banana peel?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Huh? Oh I get it– you’re nuts.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Chrissy, just apologize…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Dickhead here was on the phone, he walked
right into me!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Drop the act, you’ve been waiting all day
for this moment.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Shut the fuck up.</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: Go home, you’re fired.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What?…</p>
<p><strong>ronnie</strong>: You heard me.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Fuck you too.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Let’s get this over with… Where’s the next
key? Does she have it?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I wish you people could be a little more
subtle.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Asshole, just send me the goddamn
dry-cleaning bill. Could you–?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Don’t you have something for me?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Uh-huh sure, here you go.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Wait, you really work here–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Not anymore, thanks to you.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Slow down– you don’t understand, I thought
it was a gag.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, you don’t understand. I carry mace
and I know how to use it.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I was only trying to apologize.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Shit, it’s in here somewhere–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Shit–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You got a fucking phone, call an
ambulance!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: This is just too weird– it can’t be
real–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You really are insane!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: We need an ambulance, guy’s having a
heart attack near the MUNI station at 5th and Market– What’s the number
on this thing?!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I don’t give it out– 731-5723–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: 731-5723– yeah, thanks–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Is there anything I can do?</p>
<p><strong>paramedic #1</strong>: Could you come with us, help us fill
out a few forms–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No! I have work to do–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Wait a minute, you’ve got my phone–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Chill, will you?!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I don’t want to be here.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Neither do I, now siddown, get outta
their way!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’d like my phone back please.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Oh, this day keeps getting better.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What is your problem, you think the whole
fucking world revolves around you?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: As a matter of fact…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What the fuck is going on?!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: It’s a little hard to explain…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Try!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I seem to be playing a game. This is
supposed to be funny–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: –a challenge, a puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: OK, I’m puzzled. Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Damn it, no signal.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Here’s a lightswitch–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I wouldn’t–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I don’t know the rules, if there are any,
but it seems the obvious move usually backfires…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Of course. I have no idea what you’re
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I think I have a key.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Damn it… Wrong key…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Last match.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Too bright for you, is it?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I can see now. Grab my arm.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No way! You’re crazy!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Stay on the path!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Christine, don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Leave me alone!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Help!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Aaggh! BUGS!!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Where are the glasses?!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Fuck the glasses!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: We can’t get out of here without them!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: They’re rubber. Hold onto me, I’ll get us
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Ha!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Fine, stay.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What’s your favorite color?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: …Blue?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wow… OK, this is kinda cool. Hey!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Sorry, it’s my game. But we’ll take
blue.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Talk about the blind leading the blind…
what’s your name anyway?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Sky Van Orton.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Sky? Were your folks hippies or
something?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Far from it.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m Christine Kaminsky.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: It’s a company called Consumer Recreation
Services, CRS. I never know what’s gonna happen next.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Well, who does.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Until recently, I had a pretty good idea…
Duck.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: So are you like a serious masochist, or
just really, really bored?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’m sorry, you shouldn’t have been dragged
into this.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Well… I have to tell you something. Some
guy came into Leo’s yesterday, showed me your picture, offered me 250
bucks to spill that food on you.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Said it was a practical joke. I figured
what the hell, I can use the money– I got him up to 500. I hated that
fucking job anyway–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Wait, so the heart attack, you knew that
was a joke too–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No! It scared the shit out of me–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: But that CPR routine–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I used to be a lifeguard.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: We’re getting somewhere…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: How do we get up there?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Well, that was pointless… but different…
kind of fun…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Mm, a different kind of fun. What’s your
middle name?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Louise… why?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You’re supposed to be here… they picked
you for a reason.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: But– why?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Probably knew you’d play Good Samaritan
for that guy, drag me along– but they could have hired an actor for
that, less of a risk…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: This is really sick. I think they’re
trying to fix us up.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Maybe you can’t play alone–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Who says I want to play? OK, what the
fuck are you doing in the dumpster.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: There’s something in here I need.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What’s that for?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I imagine I’ll find out.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What are you looking at?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: This is their offices. We must have been
in their garage… my office is just a few blocks from here, we can get
cleaned up there.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Find everything you need?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You’re outta conditioner.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: My apologies, I’ll have it taken care of.
Help yourself to the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: So um… how rich are you anyway?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Rich enough. Bit forward, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Well, what exactly do you do?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Manage investments, some venture capital,
I’m on the board of a number of publicly traded companies…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: So you just like, move money around?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Basically. Beats working, huh?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You don’t look so bad, without the
tie.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Look, I hope you haven’t been too put out…
I could probably get you another job, I have a stake in a couple of
restaurants–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m not much of a waitress, really.
Y’know, today’s been kind of–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Can you type?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Kind of a turn-on, you know? I didn’t
mean– just, the danger… Like fucking in a graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Mm. So where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Out in Concord, with my folks,
unfortunately. They’re never gonna believe that I’ve been hanging out
with a guy like you.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Nothing, just– most of the guys I see
have tats, y’know? Tattoos…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Of course. We’d better head downstairs,
the limo’s waiting.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Mind if I smoke in here?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Yes. Up here on the left.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: So what’s our next move? I mean, in the
game. Obviously we need to figure out what that crank thing is for–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’m not playing anymore.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I have a life. Jack’ll take you home, or
wherever you want to go.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Yeah, maybe I’ll get in a little ballroom
dancing before bed–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wait, what about your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: C’mon it’s a brand new sweatshirt.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No, it’s not– just– back from the
cleaners.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You dry clean your sweatshirts…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Drive. Anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Jesus, David, you scared the shit out of
me–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’m sorry Sky, just drive, please–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Where were you today?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I almost didn’t make it at all. I been in the
bar for hours, waiting for you to come back to your car– Jesus, I can’t
believe I did this to you, I’m so sorry–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Slow down, take a breath– what are you
talking about?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The game! It just doesn’t stop! I thought I’d
finished playing a long time ago, I paid the bill, then it started all
over again, they won’t leave me alone–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Calm down. What are they doing to you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Everything. It just doesn’t stop.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Look. That’s crazy. Yes, it’s a pain in
the ass, but why would they keep playing once you paid them?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know! I paid them MORE to make it
stop, God help me I even gave you to them… but they won’t leave me
alone!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: It was on my windshield–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh shit, oh SHIT they must be following
us–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: They’re shooting at us!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: David, get a grip, it’s just a flat
tire!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Damn it, the phone’s not working–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Fine, I’ll change the fucking thing
myself.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Just hurry– I’ll pop the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No, you can’t do it from–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What the fuck are those–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Like you don’t know. Sonofabitch, they got to
you first, didn’t they?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Um, David– hello?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s more than that isn’t it? You’re part of
it, you’re one of them! Of course, it makes perfect sense!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: They planted those keys! I don’t know what
the hell they’re for–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’re behind the whole thing aren’t you? You
and your sick fucking friends set it up–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What?! What friends? Get a grip, David–
why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I don’t know, out of boredom, to get back at
me–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: For what?!</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: For being a weirdo, for trying to be happy?
Well, congratulations, you win. Now make it stop!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I can’t! Listen to me–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>phone voice</strong>: If you’d like to make a call, please
hang up and dial again– if you need help–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Six three six Mission, please.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You’re heading the wrong way.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Why are you doing this–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What the fuck is this–</p>
<p><strong>cabbie/rasta</strong>: Have a nice day…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Mister– are you all right?!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Thank you… I’m very grateful.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Shouldn’t swim in the Bay, you could get
hepatitis.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I have to get in touch with the
police.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You’re freezing, I got some dry clothes
below.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Do you need any help?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Uh, no. I’m fine. These fit…
…perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Sure I can’t do something for you?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I am finished playing.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: OW! Let go!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: This has got to fucking STOP!</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You’re hurting me!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Who are you!?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I just got hired to show you a good time!
C’mon please get off me…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I am not into this kinda shit!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Who hired you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I don’t know, the service set it up.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: The service?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Y’know, Fantasy Girls. They said you had this
wild fantasy, I should just wait in the boat…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Doncha want your thing? I’m supposed to give
you this, this key thingie…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: A key.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: They said you’d figure out what to do with
it.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’m supposed to carry a fucking hatchet
around…? Relax. I don’t want it.</p>
<p><strong>plympton</strong>: Thank you for your promptness, officers.
I’m Robert Plympton, Mr. Van Orton’s attorney–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Let’s go. Seventh floor.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Management company for the building said
this floor hasn’t been rented. We checked with the Secretary of State
and the county recorder, there’s no listing of a “consumer research
service.”</p>
<p><strong>plympton</strong>: Recreation service.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Right. No sign of the boat or the girl.
Divers got the cab’s vehicle ID, the company junked it a month ago.</p>
<p><strong>gallo</strong>: The numbers you gave us are disconnected,
sir, this was the only address the phone company had. And we found your
car– it’s in impound.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: I’m a little confused as to motive here.
You said your brother sent you to these people…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: It’s not his fault, he’s unstable, he
didn’t know what he was doing–</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: And they were supposed to show you a, a
good time?</p>
<p><strong>gallo</strong>: My guess is this Feingold guy’s using an
alias… is there anything else you can tell us about him?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: He likes Chinese food…</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Don’t worry, Mr. Van Orton, we’ll get these
jokers.</p>
<p><strong>plympton</strong>: There’s clearly a civil case once we
locate the defendant…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>plympton</strong>: Y’know, Sky, things are quiet since the
closing– you could take some time off.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Oh, God–</p>
<p><strong>insert note, pan down slowly, x-close</strong>: “Like my
father before me, I kill what I love. Goodbye, cruel world, blah blah
blah…” A RED SIGNATURE ARROW is affixed by a DOTTED LINE at the
bottom,</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No no no–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You people are insane…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: How did you do this, how did you get in
here?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Look, at least leave my brother alone,
he’s fragile enough as it is–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You can’t just fuck with people like this,
you don’t know who you’re dealing with!</p>
<p>****: We know exactly who we’re dealing with, that’s the whole idea!
For a guy with your test scores, you’re pretty slow on the uptake.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What the fuck do you want from me?!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>bellhop</strong>: Hello, Mr. Van Orton.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: Mr. Van Orton. Here’s your credit card…
and the maid found this under the bed…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: That isn’t mine.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: It has your initials on it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>desk clerk</strong>: We’d just as soon you took it with you,
in any event… and in the future, you might consider choosing another
hotel for your…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’ve never been here before in my
life!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Jack… the woman you took home the other
night, where did you go?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Out to Concord…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I know, what was the address?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Mmm… it was… Beulah Drive, I think, yeah, offa
Oakdale… but didn’t you– never mind.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just– I thought you followed us there. There
was a black 500SE behind us the whole way, I just assumed…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Shit. Shit! It wasn’t me, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Of course, sir. It was a white house, I
remember… big tree in the front… with one of those, you know, tire
swings…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Jack, I’m serious. It wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It wasn’t you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>impound worker</strong>: Triple A changed your tire… bad
blow-out was it? Anyone hurt?</p>
<p><strong>impound worker</strong>: Oh. Just… we were a little curious
about the mess in the back…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: A friend’s dog– he’d been hit by a car, I
drove him to the vet… Golden retriever, beautiful animal.</p>
<p><strong>impound worker</strong>: He OK?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Too early to say.</p>
<p><strong>mr. kaminsky</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Mr. Kaminsky? Schuyler Van Orton–</p>
<p><strong>mr. kaminsky</strong>: Is that a name? Look, I’m kinda
busy.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You have a daughter named Christine? I’m
afraid she might be in danger.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Daddy? Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Sky? Hi, Sky.</p>
<p><strong>dad</strong>: Well, I’m gonna get back to that carburetor…
nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I didn’t think I’d– what are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Last night, when Jack dropped you off– did
anything happen?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No… unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I thought– eh, you don’t wanna know.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Come on–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I thought they kidnapped you, tortured
you–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What? Who?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: CRS… I saw pictures, girl with a tattoo on
her shoulder like yours–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Ssh, my folks don’t know about that yet.
So, what– they wanted ransom from you or something?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No, I thought they were trying to frame
me, they planted evidence…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Why would they do that?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I have no idea, nothing they do makes any
sense. Forget it, it’s just a game.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: So that’s the only reason you came out
here to East Hell, your stupid goddamn game.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I was worried about you. I wanted to see
you again.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: If you pretend to mean that, I’ll pretend
to believe it. Well, looks like your pals are trying to keep us
together. Buy me dinner at least?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Sure, why not.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I look like a slob, let me change.</p>
<p><strong>angle on photo</strong>: Schuyler slips the picture from its
cardboard mount– it’s an ADVERTISEMENT clipped from a glossy magazine,
TEXT printed on the portion previously unseen.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Can you get us into Chez Panisse? I
always wanted to eat there–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Mm-hmm, First Communion. What’s the
matter, you look a little green around the gills–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Don’t touch me.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Don’t be stupid. Don’t say anything, not
here, they’re watching.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: God damn it…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: OK, I know a good place we could go and
like, be alone…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It’s a beautiful night, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: There’s four of them in the van, they’re
armed. Just play along, I’ll get us out of here–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Fuck you. OK, that’s it, game over–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: –you can come out now, assholes–</p>
<p><strong>rasta man’s voice</strong>: We’re blown, let’s do it–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You idiot! Come on!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No, enough already. I’ve had it.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Now what.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Get away from there!!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Oh, now I suppose they’re going to–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Holy shit!!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What is this!?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: God, wake up, it’s a con game!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Watch out!!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: OK, we lost ’em–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What are you doing!?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Get out of my car.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I coulda handed you to them! They find me
now I’m dead–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Listen to me you bastard– I know what’s
going on! No one else is gonna tell you!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You can talk while I drive to the police
station.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No cops, I got an outstanding warrant.
Mail fraud. I’ll get nailed, but you’ll never be able to prove a thing.
Just drive.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Heard about this big swindle and– I
needed the money. You wouldn’t know what that’s like.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Spare me the snide comments. And please
don’t do that in here–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Second-hand smoke is the least of your
problems. Shit, they really screwed up, I can’t believe they didn’t take
the time to get the house right.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Wait, how did– before the game, you were
working in that bar–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: They planted me in advance, your brother
set you up.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Oh God, David’s in on it…?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It’s not his fault, he thought it was the
only way out… just another victim.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: How the hell did they think they were
gonna get my money?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Honey, they already got it.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You don’t believe me, check your bank
accounts. Listen, that night in your office, remember? I downloaded
files off your computer while you were in the shower…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I stuck in a code-breaking program to
glve CRS remote access to Van Orton Group files…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: –you’d already given them everything else
they needed. Your handwriting, voice samples, personal information, all
the tests you took… they used the data to generate your passwords.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: From there they just had to break into
the financial networks, transfer your holdings into some dummy
accounts–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Remember Jim Feingold, guy who signed you
up? He’s one of the original hackers, did a five-year stretch for
zapping Citibank.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: He’s not some dweeb flunkie, he runs the
whole show.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I’m sorry. They already did your brother,
I guess they figured you for a family of suckers…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Bet you haven’t really been taking care
of business the past few days, huh? This “game,” the psych shit about
your dad going sui…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: All of it was just to buy time, keep you
from paying attention…</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: They say I gotta confiscate your card…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: I think I have some cash.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Money isn’t everything, right?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: It might be best if you didn’t speak. I
very nearly crushed your skull just now.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: C’mon chill, what’d they take you for, a
couple hundred G’s? Chump change for a guy like you, chalk it up to
experience.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Just under a billion dollars.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: A bil–? You’re kidding, right?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Do I look like I’m kidding? This is about
more than my personal lifestyle– your pals raided pension plans,
charitable foundations, company payrolls…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh my God–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I don’t know what kind of jerk-off con
games you’ve played in the past, but now you’re in the big leagues, hon.
You just helped sabotage a small portion of the national economy– and
destroy a whole lotta lives.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You’re not having any?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Never drink it. Makes my tits hurt.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Hold still.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Sorry, this place hasn’t been cleaned in a
while. My dad built it himself, spent a lot of time here alone. Rotten
carpenter…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What’s so funny?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Just– private joke…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Well… I always told myself I wasn’t gonna
end up like him. And now here I am, running his corporation, living in
his house, hiding in the cabin where he went to hide right before he… I
even look like the bastard.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Not that much.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Mm, plus I’m a helluva lot more gullible
than he ever was…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: My, lawyer. So. What’s our next move?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Wait– that’s not true–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: He’s in on it.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Oh, God…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What are they paying you, Robert? Piece of
the action?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: We have to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Well, that was stupid.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: OK, they’ve gotten to him. OK. Is there
anyone I can trust?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Mm… I wouldn’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It’s out of your hands.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Christine!!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That’s not my name.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Why…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: We needed you to call your banks.
Cellular calls can be intercepted, rerouted, y’know.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: All those calls to Switzerland and Chase
Manhattan– you were talking to our people. See, we were still missing a
lotta pieces– access codes, passwords, stuff even Plyrnpton didn’t have–
but now we have I everything. I guess you are pretty fucking stupid– but
thanks.</p>

IMPACT, as MR. VAN ORTON’S FACE SMASHES into the ground, his GLASSES
SHATTERING, BLOOD SPRAYING from his head.</p>
<p><strong>138. cut back to</strong>: SCHUYLER writhes, fighting the
drug.</p>
<p><strong>139. flash-cut to</strong>: The moment of his father’s jump–
only in this HALLUCINATION, SCHUYLER himself wears the robe, leaps into
space.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It’s over. Just let go…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Where am I?!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Please, help me, I’m an American! I’m
lost! Please!!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Hello. Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: Tegucigalpa. Tegucigalpa.
Tegucigalpa?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: That’s gibberish!</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: It is the capital of Honduras.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: So– you have become, lost from, from
your father…?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: My father’s dead, God damn it. I have to
get to the United States embassy.</p>
<p><strong>desk sergeant</strong>: Do you know what this says?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: “I am an American. I am an idiot. My father
is very rich. If I become lost, please take me to the police. There is a
reward.”</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Mr. Van Orton… is this a joke of some sort?
What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Well, without any identification it will
take at least a week to get you a temporary visa–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: A week?! Christ knows what they can do in
a week– and what the hell am I supposed to, to live on?! What day is it
anyway? Where’s the nearest pawn shop?</p>
<p><strong>pawn shop owner</strong>: This will buy you a plane
ticket.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Yeah, well I, I seem to have lost my
passport…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Huh, close enough…</p>
<p><strong>pawn shop owner</strong>: I throw them in. This man says he
can help you…</p>
<p><strong>“my father was right,” “no reason to continue,” “take my own
life,”</strong>: “I WANT ONLY DEATH…” and finally the signature,
“SCHUYLER VAN ORTON…” This suicide note is no joke.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No. Fuck you… I’m going to live…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The medication seems to be helping.
Unfortunately we’re going to have to transfer your brother to a public
institution in a few days, his funds are entirely exhausted– unless
you’re prepared to take responsibility…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: David…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hello Sky…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Sorry, I was just eating… I’m much better.
Really.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Thank God… Listen, I know you put them
onto me– but I understand, we’re both victims of this thing… They’ve
stolen everything we ever had, they’re trying to drive us both crazy–
but we won’t let them. We’ll find a way. There’s gotta be a way to beat
these bastards! We’re in it together…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: In what together?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: The game.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, Schuyler, there is no game. It was just a
fantasy of mine, a self- aggrandizing delusion… I can’t believe you took
that shit seriously.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: No, David– please…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh, man, stop fucking with me! You know the
game doesn’t exist… it never did! It never did…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Can you see?</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: So the waitress was in on it–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: She isn’t really a waitress.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: –and now you’re brother’s been
institutionalized… is there a history of mental illness in your
family?</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: ’Scuse me.</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Whatcha reading?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>gallo</strong>: I just spoke with his lawyer Plympton, he
thinks Van Orton’s having a nervous breakdown, we should probably hold
onto him till his people can get down here…</p>
<p><strong>alarm monitor</strong>: Probably just your keys, sir–</p>
<p><strong>barnett</strong>: Yo, Schuyler, wait up–</p>
<p><strong>punk</strong>: End of the line, man.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Are the tattoos supposed to mean
something?</p>
<p><strong>punk</strong>: Yeah, they mean you’re dead, you don’t gimme
what you got.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: OK, there’s the C…</p>
<p><strong>punk</strong>: Give me the fucking bag!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Come on, you’re not going to put me
through all this shit and then kill me on a fucking train, it won’t look
like a suicide…</p>
<p><strong>transit cop</strong>: Freeze assholes!</p>
<p><strong>punk</strong>: Psycho pulled a knife on me!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What do you think you’re doing, this guy
attacked me!</p>
<p><strong>transit cop</strong>: Wait here–</p>
<p><strong>radio voice #1</strong>: –can’t let him get away with this,
he’s outta control! The next thing you know, he’ll push the wrong button
and we’ll all be dead–</p>
<p><strong>radio voice #2</strong>: –Whoah whoah whoah– OK the guy’s a
moron, sure, but he doesn’t have the balls to end the world! Anyway I’m
sicka talking politics, let’s get back to the business of nipple
piercing– you got a ring, don’t ya Robin?</p>
<p><strong>radio voice #2</strong>: Ugh, we gotta do commercials, this
is the Howard Stern show…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Hello Elizabeth…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be bothering you–
you’re a genuinely good person, your work is important, it’s real,
nothing that happens to me is real anymore–</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What has happened to you, Sky?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I need your help, you’re the only one
left, the only one I can trust– not that I deserve your help, God how
could you have even married me, I was a shit to you–</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No you weren’t–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Yes I was. Sometimes I think I’m being
punished for my sins, I mean, there has to be a reason…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: This is one of their devices, I pulled it
off their assassin in the subway. It’s how they communicate with each
other.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s… a radio…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I can’t find the right channel… Listen, I
may not make it through this– if anything happens, get that notebook to,
to, the press, or the FBI or something. Someone you can trust, I don’t
know, assuming you can trust anyone. I just want you to know I’m not
crazy, and I didn’t kill myself, no matter what they say–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Has this been opened?</p>
<p><strong>barmaid</strong>: No sir. Just like you said.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I don’t think coffee is safe.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Schuyler, try and listen to me. I love
you, I always have, I always will. And maybe this is… good. Maybe this a
point you had to reach, before–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Before what?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Before– I’m just glad you came to me for
help. I don’t know if I’m strong enough to, to handle this on my own but
I know a lot of excellent crisis people–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Crisis people. Crisis people?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Hello? Hi, hon, I’m OK… um, could I call
you back…?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You bastard! You fucking bastard! How did
you find me here!?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Fuck you!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: He’s an actor…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Of course he’s an actor, it’s a
commercial.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: He’s just a fucking actor…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Have you taken something?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Are you on drugs?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Schuyler, I’m calling a friend right now,
I want you to wait here with me until–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Elizabeth, please… I’m sorry, I’II be
alright, it’s just been a hard day… Listen, I gotta use the restroom, be
right back–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: He’s an actor, does TV commercials, I know
he’s ordered from you, he had food delivered to an office building on
Mission–</p>
<p><strong>chinese woman</strong>: Many customers, very busy, I don’t
know, I don’t know–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Damn it!</p>
<p><strong>chinese woman</strong>: Stop that, what you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Isn’t there any way we can get in touch
with him now…? I see…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Bill Fisher, hi! I really admire your
work…</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Oh please… I got my kids here…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Get rid of them.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Hey, everyone– here’s a twenty! Snack
time!</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Look, buddy, it was just a job– nothing
personal, y’know? I play my part, improvise a little, that’s what I’m
good at, I still do a little stand-up–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’ve seen your resume. I’m sick of foot
soldiers, I’ve gotta get to whoever’s in charge.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Of CRS? Christ, nobody knows, nobody gets
the big picture– Jason, Tommy, cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Goddammit, why do they do that.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: How do I find them!? Their offices were
abandoned–</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: They own the whole building, they just
move from floor to floor.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: OK… They know you, you’ve worked for them.
You’re going to get me inside.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Uh-uh, I’m sorry and all, but–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Tell them anything, tell them the cops are
after you, you’ve gotta talk to someone or you’ll blow the whistle.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: No way, it’s too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You don’t seem to understand. Right here,
right now– I’m the danger.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: We’re here, Sky. They said they’re on the
twelfth floor.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Drive in, then.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Look– what are you gonna do? Really?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Really– I don’t know. Improvise. Go!</p>
<p><strong>gate guard</strong>: You’re not authorized to be here.</p>
<p><strong>gate guard</strong>: Yo!</p>
<p><strong>security man</strong>: You’re a dead man.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I’m back from the dead.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Listen, everything’s OK, nobody touched
your money, nobody stole a thing, that’s impossible–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I don’t give a fuck about the money, I
wanna know who’s behind this, who did this to me, how, why–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: It’s just a game!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You’re not going anywhere. Feingold, or or
Fisher, was that just a game too?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I watched him die…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Seemed like a nice guy, actually, father
of three–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Well, look, I’m sure it’s just another
stunt– that can’t be real, taste it.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You taste it, you fucking vampire.</p>
<p><strong>gate guard</strong>: Could you come with us, please? You’re
not authorized to be here.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Back off. Everybody back off.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Shit, how do we get out–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Wait a minute. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: It’s my gun…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: We didn’t give it to you? Where did it
come from?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: A gun store.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: We searched your house!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Guess you fucked up again.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: He’s armed, he’s got a real gun. Real
Situation, real–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Yeah, it’s real all right.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Schuyler this is all fake, tricks, it’s
all part of the game–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Stop it. Every word out of your mouth is a
lie–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: The key!! They, we gave you a key to the
elevator! Why would we do that?! We wanted you to come up–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Of course you did. So you could kill me
or, or frame me for murder–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: No, no, it’s THE GAME!! Blanks, squibs,
high-tech special effects, none of it’s real! Just open that door and
I’ll show you!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I open the door and I die.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You move again I swear I’ll kill you, you
bitch.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: THINK ABOUT IT!! They followed you every
step of the way, the cab, in the trunk, we had a diver–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: They? We?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: –the guy in Honduras, the cop on the
train, there was always a safety net, always–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Shut up, shut the fuck up!!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: We’ve been trying to end it since you got
back, our people came to your house, they tried to bring you in from the
subway, you kept running, you weren’t supposed to keep getting lost–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You just said you wanted me to come here–
you’re making this up as you go along!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Please Sky, please. Take a breath and
think about it!</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Stop. Fucking. With my head!</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You’re all right, it’s OK, just
relax…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Please… when you open the door, the game
ends… just open the door… Bill Fisher’s out there, he’s fine, nobody got
hurt. Why would we do the crazy things we did, if it wasn’t part of a
game? We thought you knew that…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Oh God. I blew it… we blew it…</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: You shot her!? No! Qh God no…</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: He fucking shot them!!</p>
<p><strong>rasta</strong>: I’ll call an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: David, David, no, no–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Oh God, Oh God, Sky, save me, I don’t wanna
die, I don’t wanna–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: You’re not gonna die. I’m here, you’re not
gonna die…</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Hang on, just hang on, you’re gonna make
it–</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: That stupid…</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Oh God. I thought you could handle it. All
the tests… they said you could handle it…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: You fucking psycho, you piece of shit,
how could you–</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: God, why– there was no point. It was
supposed to be fun…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Fun…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Hey, bro, how you doin’?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Admit it, you weren’t bored…</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Jesus. Sky, c’mon Sky–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: You’ve been wanting to do that for a long,
long time, haven’t you?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Like they’d really leave a loaded gun lying
around. They went over the whole place with a metal detector, then
packed that thing with blanks.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good one, buddy, really had you going, didn’t
we?</p>
<p><strong>pete</strong>: Wait’ll you try level two… Joke.</p>
<p><strong>rasta</strong>: That look on your face up there? Shit, man, I
almost lost it.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Awesome game– best I’ve seen.</p>
<p><strong>feingold</strong>: Sure glad you jumped, compadre. Otherwise
I was supposed to throw you off. It’s not strictly legal, so don’t tell
anyone… The cigar. It’s a Monte Cristo, straight from Havana.</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Hey… you all right?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I think so. You?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Little shook. I’m pretty much a method
actress, y’know?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Susan. Susan Waters.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Nice to meet you, Susan…</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Can I have a puff?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Look, I have to know. Who’s really in
charge?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: God?</p>
<p><strong>plympton</strong>: What is this, Sky? We got a call from your
brother, said there was a surprise party…</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Kind of late for your birthday, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: If you wanted to borrow my car, you
could’ve just asked–</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I know, Liz, I’ve been an idiot, and I’m
sorry…</p>
<p><strong>plympton</strong>: You OK?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Yeah– I’m good, really. Happy to be alive…
Listen, it’s great to see all of you, thanks for coming– but there’s
something I have to do. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: So what’s the object of the game?</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What game?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Very good…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: Is it always like this?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Mine was a little weirder. Tell you about it
sometime.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: The bill. It’s itemized. Don’t bother opening
it now…</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: I thought it was a gift.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Well, no, the card was the gift, the rest was
up to you.</p>
<p><strong>schuyler</strong>: What? Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>christine</strong>: Does it matter?</p>
