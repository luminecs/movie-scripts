COPY.]</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s six a.m…. Ooooooo and that bed never felt
sooooo gooood… Mmmm, you linger in a warm, gentle dream state… ever so
comfortable… ever so safe…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … <u>But suddenly you realize it’s</u>
<u>Monday</u>!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … your hand races to shut off the alarm before
your mind wakes up…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … But it’s too late! If you don’t get out of
bed now, you’ll never have enough time to blow dry your hair <u>that
special way</u>… You’ll never make that nine o’clock meeting that your
<u>partner will be early for</u>… <u>You will</u> <u>be late and
everyone will notice</u>!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Rumors will fly about you losing your edge…
Someone will casually mention they saw you downing shots of tequila at
the Xmas party and before you know it, you’re spilling your guys to a
Senate committee or selling yourself on street corners to middle aged
men from the Midwest… Headlines flash across your mind – “<u>Sleeping
Investment Banker Guns D.J.</u> <u>Then Self – Claimed – ‘I only</u>
<u>wanted two more minutes</u>!’”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Hey, it’s Monday morning, and I’m Jack
Lucas.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: … I don’t have to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes… Yes, you do because you see, today,
you’re our…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And in the spirit of fairness, we want the
public to hear your side of things. So, now… how long were you and
Senator Peyton having this sleazy affair?</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: I am tired of the public thinking they’ve got
the right to invade a person’s private life.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: That’s still all anybody talks about. Nobody
even thinks to ask whether we loved each other.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because nobody cares about that, sweetheart.
Nobody wants to hear about your romantic love. No. We want to hear about
the back seats of limos… the ruined lives of people we want to be… new
and exotic uses for champagne corks…</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Listen, I have been humiliated enough
already!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Perhaps not – We need those details…</p>
<p><strong>jack and crew</strong>: Ooooo…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi, this is Jack Lucas and we’re discussing
personal pet peeves. Go ahead, caller.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Okay… well… It’s my husband…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Huh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: He drives me crazy. I’ll be talking and
he’ll never let me finish a sentence… He’s always finishing my…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – Finishing your thoughts. That’s awful.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Oh! It absolutely drives me…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: – Drives you crazy, huh? The scoundrel.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: Hello Jack. It’s Edwin.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Edwin. We haven’t heard from you in what – a
day?… I’ve missed you.</p>
<p><strong>edwin</strong>: I’ve missed you too, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack and crew</strong>: Awwww…….!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession
time… what have you got for us?</p>
<p><strong>edwin</strong>: I… I… went to this bar… this very, ya know –
hard-to-get-in place… called Babbitt’s…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, I know the place. It’s one of those chic
<u>yuppie</u> gathering holes.</p>
<p><strong>edwin</strong>: Okay… I know but… I met this beautiful
girl…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Now, Edwin, if you start telling me you’re in
love again, I’m going to have to remind you of the time we made you
propose to that check-out girl at Thrifty’s that you liked so much.
Remember her reaction…</p>
<p><strong>black seventies group</strong>: “Mister Big Stuff… Huh… Tell
me… Who do you think you are… Mister Big Stuff… you’re never gonna get
my love…”</p>
<p><strong>edwin</strong>: I wasn’t serious about her, Jack. That was
just a joke for you guys… She was just a girl. This is a beautiful
woman. She wears pearls.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?</p>
<p><strong>edwin</strong>: I think she likes me… she gave me her number,
but she must work a lot cause when I call she’s never home… But I think
we’ll go out this weekend… I’ve…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, Edwin, <u>sure</u>… and <u>Pinnochio</u>
is a true story… <u>Edwin! Wake up!</u> This is a fairytale…</p>
<p><strong>edwin</strong>: No, Jack, no, it’s not… She likes me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo… Believe
me – this tart will never make it to your desert plate…</p>
<p><strong>edwin</strong>: She <u>likes</u> me. She said for me to
call!</p>
<p><strong>michael mcdonald</strong>: “What a fool believes… He
sees…”</p>
<p><strong>edwin</strong>: <u>Jack</u>!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Edwin… Edwin… Edwin… I told you about these
people. They only mate with their own kind. It’s called
<u>Yuppie-In-Breeding</u>… that’s why so many of them are retarded and
wear the same clothes. They’re not human. They can’t feel love. They can
only negotiate love moments. They’re evil, Edwin. They’re repulsed by
imperfection and horrified by the banal – everything America stands for.
Edwin, they have to be stopped before it’s too late. It’s us or
them.</p>
<p><strong>edwin</strong>: Okay, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack lucas</strong>: Well, folks… It’s been a thrill, as
always. “Have a perfect day”…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Everyone here on the Jack Lucas Morning Show
says “bye”.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is Jack Lucas… So long… arriverderch…
I’ll be sure to send you a thought today as I lie in the backseat of my
stretch limo, have sex with the teenager of my choice… And that thought
will be: Thank God I’m me!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I want you all to know I’m getting sick again
and it’s because someone keeps forgetting to raise the thermostat before
I come in here… My fucking ass is freezing for the first hour.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You know some of this is very funny. Cheever
told me they’ve even secured the rights to the Donna Summer song to play
over the credits.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ooooo, I have chills… Are you sure they want
me? I won’t read unless I have an offer.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Jack, of course… Not even a question. When I
spoke to him on the phone this morning, I could actually smell how much
they want you for it. I could smell it over the phone.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I don’t think I have any change.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I am not opening this window. A couple of
quarters isn’t going to make any difference anyway.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I hate my cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Can I ask that when you clean your hands you
wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless
steel.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: You can ask.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Raoul called before. About dinner.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: About dinner as a concept or about dinner
with… <u>Raoul</u>?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: You’re so witty. I’m so jealous… I
<u>need</u> to get out of here, Jack, and do something other than sit in
this apartment and count how many funny lines you have per page.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know, tomorrow’s a very big day for me… It
would be nice if you acted like you understood.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Fine. I’ll say no.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They’re putting me on film tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … First time in my life I’ll be a voice with a
body. Do you know what that means? What this could lead to?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Jack, it’s a sitcom – you’re not defining
Pi.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ll remember that the next time you get
excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran. Want some?</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: No, I have to work.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How un-sixties of you.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: I was nine in the sixties.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I used to think my biography would be JACK
LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE
FACE “AND” THE VOICE…or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT…</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: Jack, I have work to do too.</p>
<p><strong>sondra</strong>: …Can’t we do this later?… All
right..well..If we do this now, can I have dinner with Raoul?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “Hey…for-…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: ” HEY! Forgive MEEE!” …. …FOR-GIVE-ME …
Hey…forgive me! I have this…I really have this…</p>
<p><strong>jack’s voice over</strong>: “…everything America stands for.
Edwin, they have to be stopped before it’s too late…. It’s us or
them.”</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: It was Mr. Lucas’s off-handed remark that
seemed to have a fatal impact on Mr. Malnick…</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: An after work hot spot, Babbitt’s is
popular with single young professionals.</p>
<p><strong>reporter on scene</strong>: Edwin Malnick arrived at the peak
hour of seven-fifteen, took one long look at the handsome collection of
the city’s best and brightest - then removed a shotgun from his overcoat
and opened fire.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Seven people were killed before
Mr. Malnick …</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: These people are insane today. They took
insane pills…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hey! Mr. Happiness!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Are we going to work today or what?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: <u>Hello</u>!!!</p>
<p><strong>frumpy secretary</strong>: Can you help me!…</p>
<p><strong>frumpy secretary</strong>: … I’m at an absolute loss. I’ve
been looking for an hour – I’m losing my mind. … I’m sort of in the mood
for a Katharine Hepburny, Cary Granty kinda thing – Nothing heavy… I
couldn’t take heavy. Somethin’ zany. I need zany.</p>
<p><strong>frumpy secretary</strong>: …OH! OH! Do you have anything with
that… comedian who’s on that show? What’s it - ON THAT RADIO! Ya know,
the guy that says “HEY…FORGIVE ME…!</p>
<p><strong>frumpy secretary</strong>: I get such a kick outta the way he
says that…He’s so adorable! Didn’t he make a movie… I need something
like that - a funny, no brainy kinda thing.</p>
<p><strong>frumpy secretary</strong>: Great… “ORDINARY PEEPHOLES”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s kind of a - Big Titty- Spread Cheeky
kinda thing…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: …I’m sorry. I need to borrow him for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of
those days when you’re in …whadda call it… an emotional abyss? Talk to
me, cause I don’t understand these moods.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anne, they’re MY moods. If you want to
understand moods, have one of your own!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Why don’t you go upstairs… take the day off.
All right?…I’ll cook tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Are you going for a specific look with
this?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Well, it’s funny! Whatta want from me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s not funny. It’s… sophomoric and mindless…
and dumb.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Then why the hell do we watch all the
time?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Because it makes me feel good to see how not
funny it is and how America doesn’t know the first thing about funny
which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that
would just mean that I’m not really talented.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’re a sick fuck… I don’t know why you
torture yourself. Too many thoughts – too crowded in there. You should
read a book.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s important to think. It’s what separates
us from lentils… and people who read books like… … “Love’s Flower
Bed.”</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It happens to be a beautiful love story. Ya
know, you used to like that about me. You used to say you liked that I
didn’t make you think so much. That we could be together and not
think…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, well… suicidal paranoiacs say funny
things sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Madness.</p>
<p><strong>boy</strong>: Mr. Bum.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anybody here named Jimeny?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You ever read any Nietzsche?…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Nieztsche says that there are two kinds of
people in this world… People who are destined for greatness like… Walt
Disney and… Hitler… and then there’s the rest of us… He called us the
Bungled and Botched. We get teased. We sometimes get close to greatness
but we never get there. We’re the expendable masses. We get pushed in
front of trains… take poison aspirins… get gunned down in Dairy
Queens…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You wanna hear my new title for my biography,
my little Italian friend… “It Was No Fucking Picnic - The Jack Lucas
Story”. Like it?… Just nod yes or no… “Il Nouva Esta Fuckin’ Pinicko” –
You’re a good kid… Just say no to drugs… Ya ever get the feeling
sometimes… you’re being punished for your sins…?</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: What’s going on?…</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: I said what’s going on? What are you doing
here?</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: You shouldn’t hang around this
neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I… I was just leaving.</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: People spend a lot of hard earned money for
this neighborhood. It’s not fair… looking out their windows to see your
ass asleep on the streets…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes… I… I agree…</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: Good. You believe this drunk?</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: …..Me neither.</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: What the-….</p>
<p><strong>windbreaker</strong>: AHHH!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass
of a one balled donkey!</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: It’s just a bum…You know, there’s enough in
here for the two of you.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish…now begone…before
somebody drops a house on you!…</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: You a fag too?</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Oooo…that looks like it hurts.</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: OWWW….What are you nuts?!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: BINGO! Tell the man what he’s won!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I advise you to let us go.</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: You advise us!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: You’re out numbered son.</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: Come on! Go for it! What the hell are they
gonna do? They can’t do nothin!</p>
<p><strong>three bums</strong>: I like New York in June…How about you? I
like a Gershwin tune…How about you?</p>
<p><strong>windbreaker</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Son…There comes a time in every man’s
life…and you will learn this, if and when you become men…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: ….That there are only three things in this
world ya need…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: …Respect for all kinds of life, ….the love of
one other person who you can trust and pork on a regular basis …and a
nice navy blazer…Oh, and one more thing….always… keep your eye…. on the
ball!</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: Ow…Ow….OW!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: However, the ability to bean a shithead can
be a fabulous advantage.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: OWW…MAN…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please don’t hurt me?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: “OH beings blind! What ignorance besets
you!</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: You can’t leave me tied up out here alone,
you fucking faggot!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: You won’t be alone for long.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I need a drink.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I know a great place. …UH…WARREN!</p>
<p><strong>bums</strong>: I like New York in June…How about-….</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: NO..GUYS…GUYS…. They’re so proud.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: …There ain’t no justice in life! There’s just
satisfaction. And the death penalty’s just another violation of my
constitutional right to satisfaction Goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>irishman</strong>: I hate that.</p>
<p><strong>hippie</strong>: So, you mean if somebody like, killed your
mother, you wouldn’t want him dead?</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: Sure I would. But I should get to kill him
Goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>irishman</strong>: He gets to kill him. That’s democracy,
see.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is it. I’m in hell. Damned to an eternity
of idiotic conversation.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Great place huh?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: AAAAHHHH!</p>
<p><strong>irishman</strong>: How are you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Fine John and you?</p>
<p><strong>irishman</strong>: Can’t complain.</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: Crazy fuck.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: So what do you think of the death
penalty?</p>
<p><strong>irishman</strong>: Death’s definitely a penalty. Ain’t no
fucking gift. Life’s too goddamn short.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I better be going…</p>
<p><strong>irishman</strong>: Have a drink…don’t be shy!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I think they like you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh no that’s all-</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: DRINK! GODDAMN IT!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Would anyone like a fruit pie?</p>
<p><strong>three bums</strong>: No thank you…Too sweet…to
fattening…Goddamn it.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Et in arcadia ego.</p>
<p><strong>hippy</strong>: Man…Why did God invent mediocrity?</p>
<p><strong>we fade out of the scene on the next lines - as he close his
eyes</strong>: AND SLIPS INTO A DRUNKEN SLUMBER.</p>
<p><strong>hippie</strong>: You were phenominal tonight, Parry.
SUPER-BUM, man! Fucking Marvel Comics…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: How are you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Have I died?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Hahahahaaa… Nononono… Not yet… Hahahaha…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: If you’re going to murder me, that’s fine…
just don’t laugh.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where am I?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: My abode… My domicile… My neck of the woods…
Hungry? Breakfast? A fruit pie perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No… thanks… Listen –</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: My name is Parry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi… Where are my shoes?</p>

<p><strong>parry</strong>: Sshhhh!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I knew it! I knew it last night! I did too!
He’s the one!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: … Can you keep a secret?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Do you know what the Little People just told
me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The Little People?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: They said you’re The One.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m the one what?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: <u>Oh shut up</u>!!!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: … I’ve got a right to say something. I mean,
you’re tying my hands here! They say you’re not ready to know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not… Now, where are those shoes…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: … You’re frightening him!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: … Do you know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uhh… I’m drawing a blank.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Take a guess… <u>Let him guess</u>!!
<u>Tch</u>.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh… gee… well… you seem to be some kind of
vigilante…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: No, no… I mean that sort of happens along the
way but no… I’m on a very special quest.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A quest?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: But I need help and <u>they</u> sent you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The Little…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: They work for Him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Him…?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: God… I’m the janitor of God.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: … <u>They</u> came to me about a year ago. I
was sitting on the john having one of the most satisfying bowel
movements – you know the ones – where you just see God… And I saw them…
just floating around… hundreds of these… cute little fat people… And
they spoke. They said “I” was chosen to help them get back something
very important they lost. But my part might be very dangerous. I said
“Whoah”…. slow down… ya start hearing voices from floating little fat
people that tell you you’re on a mission for God and you wind up in a
mini-series. Then <u>they</u> said “Look in Architecture Today, Feb ’88…
page 33…”</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: And there it was… plain as day.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Langdon Carmichael?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: It’s the Grail… The Holy Grail.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The Holy Grail? Some billionaire has the Holy
Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I know! You can’t imagine how surprised I
was. Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East
Side.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen… I don’t mean to be flippant or to
enrage you or anything but… you’re an imbecile. And I’m not The One… I’m
not <u>any</u> One…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think you’re a very nice… very nice
psychotic man. I really appreciate what you did for me. It was a very
brave and noble thing…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Oh, please… you’re embarrassing me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I wish you all the luck in the world. When you
get the Grail, I’m sure I’ll be seeing lots of you on various talk
shows…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: But I can’t get it… He’s…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: He’s out there… I don’t know if… He’s always
out there, see… and…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: See, you don’t know him… That’s why you’re
the one… You can get it…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, forget the shoes. I’ll just take a
cab… Uh…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Parry.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Parry… I’m Jack.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I know…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thanks… You can keep the doll.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Thanks a mill – And I’ll give you a buzz as
soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we’ll get this thing off the
ground… Thanks for stopping by, Jack. Give my love to the wife and
kids.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not married.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Funny – you look married.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where you comin’ from?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh… basement I think…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: <u>I tell him no visitors</u>!!!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sorry… I…</p>
<p><strong>wife</strong>: It’s just my manner!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: <u>What</u>?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You a friend of Parry’s?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No… He is supposed to live there?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, well… I let him stay there. What else
could I do after such a tragedy?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tragedy?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He and his wife was were at some bar ..and
some nut came in with a shotgun and blew the place apart. She was a
beautiful girl…She never knew what hit her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: ….You must have heard about it. That nut who
listened to the radio?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Parry’s not his real name. His real name’s
Henry Sa….</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: ..Listen. I understand about open
relationships. Please. I was a teenager in the sixties after all….I
understand!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: ….But when you care about somebody ya need
more than an open relationship. Ya need a phone call.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: WHAT!….</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: A guy wants to check out the pornos…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: So send him back! … Ya need to pick up the
phone and tell me that you’re not dead… that you haven’t been attacked
or raped or who knows. You disappear last night. I don’t know what to
think. I was up all night. Look at you!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I smell gas… Do you smell gas…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I can’t tell you how distraught I was. All
night long. What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was attacked.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Two kids tried to set me on fire.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Are you almost done?!</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Whatta looking for – a story!? Here… “Creamer
Versus Creamer”… It won an award.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You were attacked. My God. Should I call a
doctor! Did you call the police…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I’m fine… really…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’re all right… you sure…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: … So… where did you sleep last night?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I… I stayed at a friend’s. Listen, I –</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Please… before you go on… let me tawk… okay…
We’ve had a wonderful time together… When we first met, you said this
wasn’t serious and I shouldn’t get serious and then you moved in and we
haven’t been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets. None.
And don’t wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me… I want
the truth. If you’re seein’ somebody else, let me know… You don’t have
to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.
Just tell me the truth.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not seeing anyone else. I really was
attacked.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Okay. … I love you…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: … You don’t have to say it back… although it
wouldn’t kill you. I’ll cook tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know what the Holy Grail is?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: The Holy Grail? Yeah… I know that. It was like
– Jesus’ juice glass.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You still believe in God?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh sure… Gotta believe in God. But I don’t
think God made man in his own image. No. ’Cause most of… the bullshit
that happens, is because of men. No, I think man was made out of the
devil’s image and women were created out of God – because women can have
babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women
are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot
more interesting – I slept with a few saints and let me tell you…
<u>Booooorring</u>!!!… And so the whole point of life, I think, is for
men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and,
ya know – work it out… … Not that we have to get married.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … You have a little… uh… something on your
face…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, I got a pimple… This stuff is supposed to
blend with my skin color… Like it really works, ya know…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t think I’m up to it tonight…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I had a very traumatic experience… I…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I think I’m getting sick… I… I slept in a
boiler room, Anne… I’m tired… I’m upset… I’m… just not in the mood!…
Okay!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Whatsa matter, hon – can’t sleep?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I tell you something, Anne. I really feel like
I’m cursed.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh stop. Things will change. My Aunt Mary
always said, there’s a remedy for everything in this world except death
and having no class.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I get this feeling like I’m… a magnet but I
attract shit. Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man
who’s wife I killed?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You didn’t kill anybody. Stop.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I wish there was some way I could… just… pay
the fine and go home.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I know. I know, honey.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m… just looking for Parry…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What did you say his name used to be?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hospital said it would be better if we kept
certain things away from him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: … That’s his real name – Henry Sagan. He was
a teacher over at Columbia. They kept him in some mental place on Staten
Island… He did not speak for over a year then all of a sudden, he starts
talkin’ only now he’s this Parry guy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: … He used to live upstairs with his wife, so
when he got released they sent him here. I felt bad. He couldn’t work.
Nobody wanted him. So I let him stay in the basement. He helps out – I
give him a couple of dollars. People throw things away he gets them.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: …She was a beautiful girl. He was crazy about
her.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: “Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what
dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence
with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again
before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful
slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee”….</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Parry!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Hi Jack…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi. Listen…I thought maybe you could use
a-</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: COME ON!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: She’ll be back….</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Isn’t she a vision?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah, gorgeous…Look, I’m going. I just wanted
to give you…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: She loves dumplings. It’s her Wednesday
ritual.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Isn’t she sweet. She does that every
time…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: She buys a new book every two days.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: She’s into trash. Whadda you gonna do?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: She’s got a real sweet tooth. If anybody ever
told me I’d be in love with a woman who eats Jawbreakers, I’d said they
were nuts. But look at that jaw!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Do you follow her every day?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Huh-huh. I’m deeply smitten.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s her name?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why did you do that?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Well, if every time someone did something
offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter
their behavior. What do you think Jack…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Oh look! A cooler!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here…I just would like to help you. I
thought…maybe…you could use some money.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Fifty dollars?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here’s another twenty. Will that do? I mean,
what’s it going to take!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: No..no, it’s..I don’t know what to say. This
is so nice of you…Jack…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s O.K.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Can I take you to lunch?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No..I have to get back to work. Take care of
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>bum</strong>: SELL!….SELL!….SELL! BUY!…BUY!…BUY!…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: HEY!!…HEY!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya
can’t start an ad agency on fifty dollars!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you doing? Give that back!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But I gave it to you!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Well what am I gonna do with it?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know. But I gave it to you…to help
YOU…not him.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: You really want to help me?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Pretty impressive huh?…Don’t let it scare
you. I’ll admit it’s formidable but everything has it’s weakness.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can’t just break into Langdon Carmichael’s
house. This man has done nothing.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: O.K…let me explain this one more time…The
Holly Grail is in -….</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All right! Listen - please…don’t start
drooling or…rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn’t
do this..There is no Holy Grail.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Of course there is, Jack. What do you think
the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don’t think so…There has to be
a Grail.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look, you’re only sort of insane, really.
People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I don’t need a job. I have a quest.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I take it back - you’re fucking deranged… And
you’re going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Tch. You are so sweet…Now I know why you’re
saying this. …You’re afraid I’m in danger and you’re trying to protect
me.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. I think you’re a moron and I don’t want to
get into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: …You are such a great guy. First the money,
now this. Isn’t he fabulous!?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Please don’t hug me in public again, O.K.?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I LOVE THIS MAN…YA HEAR ME JADED CITY… …I’M
DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON’T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Will you shut-up!!!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: You’re a true <u>friend</u>.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m not. Believe me. <u>I’m</u> scum.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: You’re a real honest to goodness <u>good</u>
guy.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m self-centered, I’m weak - I don’t have the
will power of a <u>fly</u> on shit…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: That’s why the Little People sent you. Just
<u>like</u> magic.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t believe in little floating people!
THERE IS NO MAGIC!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: So what? You going to help me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: WILL YOU PLEASE… please listen to me … You
know none of this is true - PARRY the Grail, the voices… Jack… There’s a
part of you that Come on…what are knows this isn’t true. saying… I know
who you are… I know who you are.. or who you were. You’re acting really-
You don’t belong on the No, no, no, no… streets. You’re intelligent
Jack… man….you’re a teacher… Jacck!… You were a teach at Hunter College.
Don’t you remember?…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Perry…you all right?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Parry answer me…are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: He knows who you are! He’s afraid! I can
tell!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re totally gone, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What is going o-</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh…Oh…Oh God…I’m dying. I can’t breath and I’m
dying.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Isn’t it great up here… He’s gone now, but we
had him on the run! We would’ve had his ass if we had horses! He’s
running scared!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: WHO! WHO’S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN
CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I’m sorry Jack. I thought you saw him.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: SAW WHO!!?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: The Red Knight!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The Red…? You’re totally gone, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: …..Do you hear that?! Oh “Heaven be praised,
in giving me an opportunity, so soon of fulfilling the duties of my
profession…These cries doubtless proceed from some miserable male or
female, who stands in need of my immediate aid and protection”</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is too hard.</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: GET AWAY! GET AWAY!!….</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: It’s O.K…It’s O.K…Lets me help you up.</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: NO…I WANNA GO! I WANNA GO NOW!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Come on now…You can’t sit here.</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: NO! I want a debutante on a horse to step
on me. Leave me alone!!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Parry…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Buddy, the days of the debutantes are … not
what they used to be.</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: Isn’t that awful? Poor Brenda Frazier. Poor
Little Gloria. They ruined them! THEY ATE THEM ALIVE!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: It was a crime.</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: Leave me alone…I wanna go…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Will you get the other side. Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone
will take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, maybe he wants to stay here. Do…do you
want to stay here?</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: Oh, yes, thank you - I really love bleeding
in horseshit. How very Gandhiesque of you.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Will you watch him for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: I wanna go…Just let me go…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh…Where…where do you want to go?</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: A real nice place I know… Ah…can’t get
there! Not tonight.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Where? Maybe we can.</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: No…no…we can’t…we can’t..</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on…maybe we can…where do you want to
go?</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: Venice…Like Katherine Hepburn in
SUMMERTIME. . ….Why can’t I be Katherine Hepburn…</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: I wanna die…I just wanna die…</p>
<p><strong>bum</strong>: O.K..everyone know their parts… Here we go… “I
like New York in June”…</p>
<p><strong>yuppie</strong>: “How about you…”</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: “I like a Gershwin tune…”</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: …Good!…. “I like to read good books”</p>
<p><strong>bag lady</strong>: Where the hell am I gonna put the
children? Goddamn daughter-in-law! Comes into my house looking for
dustballs! GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY DINING ROOM…you ingrate!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Tempo, people…tempo…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Can you tell me something? Did you lose your
mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: Well,… I’m a singer by trade… Summer
stock…nightclub revues… that kind of thing…It used to be what I
absolutely lived for…God…I can do GYPSY backwards - every part- but, one
night…in the middle of singing “Funny….. - it suddenly hit me… …what
does all of this really mean? That, and the fact that all my friends are
dead…God, I sound like a veteran. Dad would be so proud.</p>
<p><strong>pizza boy</strong>: Pizza!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Jack, it’s almost five. We’re going to be
late. We’re going to miss her!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Um…I’ve got to run. I’ve bee doing this all
day. Are you going to be all right?</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: Oh please!…I was born a Catholic in
Brooklyn… I’ve been to hell and back…. I’ll be fine… ….Thanks…You’re a
gem.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: He got caught – <u>God bless</u>… <u>Have a
safe trip home</u>… – Got caught pissin’ on the bookstore. Man’s a pig.
No excuse for that. We’re heading for social anarchy when people start
pissing on bookstores!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’ll never see her in this crowd.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Bless you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Asshole! Guy didn’t even look at you.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: He’s paying so he don’t have to look. What he
doesn’t know is, he’s paying for a service. Guy goes to work every day
and for eight hours, seven days a week, he bends over and gets it right
up the ass till he can’t stand…</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: … But one day, right before quitting time on
Friday, his boss is going say something like “Say Bob – come into my
office and kiss my ass”… and Bob is going think – “The hell with it! I
don’t care what happens. All I want right now is to see the expression
on his face when I stab him with these pair of scissors”…</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: … But then he thinks of me – “wait a minute!”…
he says… “It’s not so bad. At least I got two arms and two legs and I
ain’t beggin’ for money.” He puts down the scissors, and puckers up…</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: … I’m what you call a moral traffic light. It’s
like I’m saying “<u>Red</u> – go no further.”</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: Ah, Margaret.</p>
<p><strong>sid</strong>: You have to admit though… Like at 5:00 in Grand
Central… Pretty breathtaking, don’t cha think?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s such a great song.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: It’s a classic.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: God. Just one night with her. I’d die
happy.</p>
<p><strong>ethel/lydia</strong>: Got no sunshine, got no rain Still I
think I’m a lucky dame I got the sun in the morning And the moon at
night…</p>
<p><strong>tony orlando</strong>: Knock three times… on the ceiling if
you want me… Twice on the pipes…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Ya fuckin’ bastard. I don’t need this… … I Do
Not Need This! A woman my age… I am a person. This is kid stuff. You
come! You go! And all I do is cook like a jerk! You’re a waste of good
cutlets… I don’t need this… Find yourself another dope… ya fuckin’
bastard…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: What a beautiful night.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Don’t you think it’s time to go now? Running
around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed
by a wide variety of people.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Well that’s stupid. This is my park just as
much as it is theirs. You think it’s fair they keep us out just because
they make us think we’ll get killed or something?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes. I think that’s very fair.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …..What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie
on your back and you concentrate on the clouds…and you try yo break them
apart with your mind. It’s wild.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You can’t do this! This is New York! Nobody
lies in naked in a field in New York..It’s…it’s too Midwestern.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body
- ya little fella’s flappin’ in the breeze. …everybody in the city is
busy with their business and no one knows we’re bare assed in the middle
of it. Come on!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: NO! I will not! This is nuts! I’m leaving! I
mean it…this is nuts. This is too nuts…I’m leaving. I mean it!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: ..Ha…Little fella? I mean the man talks to
invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he’s naked in the
middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I’m not surprised. I’m
fucking outta my mind to even be here!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Who are you talking to Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: YOU’RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Bingo!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: They’re not moving.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What if some homophobic jogger runs by and
kills us to get back at his overbearing father?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: “JACK LUCAS FOUND DEAD - BESIDE A DEAD NAKED
MAN…THE TWO WERE DEAD…HIS COMPANION WAS NAKED”…I hate when they use the
word companion…It’s so insinuating..Although, it’ll probably boost my
biography sales. The public loves stories about successful people
falling into degenerate behavior. Makes them feel lucky to be boring and
ordinary…People stink.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Are there any questions?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Then let’s begin with the story itself. It’s
a story of the Grail myth…And although there are several variations, my
favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy… who had to spend a
night alone in the forest to prove his courage… and during that night,
he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy
Grail - God’s highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the
boy, “You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the
hearts of men”…But the boy was overcome …Innocent and foolish, he was
blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory,
hope and power…Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own…
invincibility. A boy’s tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in
this state of…radical amazement…he felt for a brief moment, not like a
boy, but like God… …And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail.
And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the
flames…leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost
him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and
find the Grail… But with each year that passed, with each campaign he
fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire
grew worse… He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it’s reason. With
each disappointment, with each betrayal… with each loss … this wound
would grow… Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people
starved…Until finally, the King lost all faith in God’s existance and in
man’s value…He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick
with experience… that he started to die. As the years went on, his
bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King
and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no
avail. Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between
ambitious men vying for the King’s power, which only confirmed the
King’s worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only
hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the
King to cheer him. He was a simple-minded man… not particularly
skilled…or admired… He tells the King some jokes…sing him some songs,
but the King feels even worse…Finally, the fool says, “What is it that
hurts you so much? How can I help?”…And the King says, “I need a sip of
water to cool my throat”…So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand,
fills it with water and hands it to the King…Suddenly, the King feels a
lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy
Grail the fool handed him…an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed
all along…And the King asks, “How can this be?…how could you find what
all my knights and wisest men could not find”? And the fool answers, “I
don’t know. I only knew you were thirsty.”… And for the first time since
he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched
by God’s glory…but rather, by the compassion of a fool.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’m so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: The Fisher King myth has alot of
derivations…I remember I was at this lecture in Princeton once - and
there was this one speaker…Henry Sa… Henry…uh…Henry…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: ….What was I saying?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: ….What was I saying?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: How come you’ve never asked that girl for a
date?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I can’t ask for her…I have to earn her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Parry, you don’t have to <u>earn</u> a woman.
It’s the twentieth century.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Maybe, when we get the Grail…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, see, I think she can help…You know women
are great..they…they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so
the knights can go out and get Grails and…and slaughter villages with a
clear head…I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Happily married, probably.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves
you keeps you going…gives you strength… Makes you feel like you can do
anything…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Is that what your girlfriend does for
you?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Could you help me– what was the name of that
girl who just came in…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: What girl? I didn’t notice.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh… she was wearing a kind of… a flouncy kind
of… uh… plain…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Oh, Lydia!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Lydia. Lydia what?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: God, I have no idea. She’s worked here
for fifteen years and I have no idea. I’ll call her.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No… no… that’s all right… I thought I knew
her… Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes. Two Hearts Publishing? May I speak to
Lydia please.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Can I have my desk please.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello, I’d like to speak to Lydia?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Lydia?! Lydia who!?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know her last name… I’ll be off in a
second.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’re calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u>
office. You must think I’m some dope. You fuckin’ bastard… You… … stay
out all night long…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What… No… Lydia… I want to speak to… her name
is Lydia… I…uh…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: … I don’t get a friggin’ phone call. You
stroll in here at noon. I got… two people out sick. Ya think I need
this? I Do Not Need This!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …<u>Forget it</u>… <u>Goodbye</u>!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I was not with a woman last night. I was out
with Parry.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: The moron?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He’s not a moron.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: And who’s Lydia?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Lydia is the girl Parry likes… And I thought,
if I could get them together I…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What? The curse’ll be lifted? <u>Will</u>
<u>you please</u>!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I… You’re not going to understand this.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Don’t treat me like I’m stupid. It pisses me
off.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All right… Sorry… I feel indebted to him.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: See, I told you!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Well, what the hell does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I thought… if… if I can help him in some way…
you know?… get him this girl he loves… Then… maybe…. things’ll start
changing for me… My luck, ya know… Maybe… Forget it… It’s a stupid
idea.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh, you poor kid… You’re a mess.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: … Well, listen… stranger things have
happened.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello Lydia?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Yeah? Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: This is Jack Lucas and I’m calling from Video
Pop video rentals.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes well… You are a credit card holder, are
you not?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Huh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of
several thousand card holders… in conjunction with several major credit
card companies…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Which ones?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All of them… Which means <u>you</u> have just
won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: How did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Your name was picked.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well, I don’t understand. What did you do –
did you pick my name out of a hat or… or… a list?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: A list.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well – were there a lot of people in the room
or just you or what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well there…. What’s the difference?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well, I mean… I don’t know you… This has
never… I’ve never won anything and… I don’t have a VCR.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You get a VCR with the membership. … For a
short time until you get your own. Listen, why don’t you come down to
the store and you can check it out. See if you’re interested.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call
me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: <u>No!</u> <u>I told you</u>! <u>You won a
contest</u>!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: ….This is going to be rough.</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: I’m Anne Morrow Lindbergh and I can’t find
my baby…</p>
<p><strong>businessman</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: See, I knew I could make you smile…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Remember. One chorus and out.</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: I’m a man with a mission, Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I can’t believe I’m on a first name basis with
these people…</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Can I … help you?</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: Is there a mousy woman who works here named
Lydia?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Yes..if you’ll wait here I’ll…</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: This is a personalized message. I have to
give it in person.</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: You MUST be SHE.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to
meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hello….congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And this is our other..uh…co-worker..
Parry..uh…Parry….</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Parry Parry?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: No just Parry.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Oh…like Moses.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: So how do we do this?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well..um…you get an official membership card…
Just sign that and we’ll laminate it right here… Parry? You want to
laminate Miss Sinclair’s card?…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: …Parry?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: This will last you one year after which you
have the option to renew if… you like at a membership discount.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: But now it’s free, right?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh… you… you can pick out up to ten
movies…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Free?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yes. They’re free.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Only the first ten. After that they’re 2.99 a
rental.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: … Can… can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: No. No… I can look myself…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: How about the “Hell Merchants”?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I don’t like horror movies!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: How about… Zbiegnew Speizak’s “The Purple
Bread,” an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the
sweeping background of a Polish bakery. In subtitles.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I don’t like… uh… Polish love stories… … I
like musicals.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Well, we have plenty of those. Right over
here. We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Got any Ethel Merman?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: … Uh… we seem to be all out of Ethel
Merman.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: What a gyp.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You know, I think I… ordered some just the
other day.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well did you or didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yes! They’ll be in soon.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well, I guess I’ll come back then.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Here’s your card.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I like your nails. Where did you get them
done?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Ah… I do them myself. I used to work in a
beauty parlor.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I like the stars.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of
a sideline…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, since you’re a member, we could…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Twenty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Okay… twenty dollars… When can you…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Tonight! How’s tonight?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Getting your nails done is one thing but going
to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>… She didn’t even look
at him.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Got any more bread crust?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: We’ll make it very casual… not like a date or
anything. I just have to find something he’ll look good in.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I don’t know… He’s a little disgusting…
Although some women go for that.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He just needs some clothes?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Got any more starchy food?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I mean, I’ve gone out with bums, but they were
gorgeous. It’s the only reason to go out with a bum.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: This food’s delicious. You’re a wonderful
cook. And you have a lovely home.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Jack, he’s starting a conversation…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well talk back. He won’t bite you.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Your welcome. You know, a beautiful woman
like yourself – your own business – I’m surprised some guy doesn’t
snatch you up for his own.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I’m shocked. With a child bearing body like
yours… … why a man would have to be out of his mind!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Most men are.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Why this is outrageous!…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: … A woman of your value going to waste before
my eyes…. Come on! I’m yours! Let’s go! Come on – let us go to that
place of splendor in the grass.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Holdin’ my penis… What a lovely way of sayin’
how Much ya like me…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Holdin’ my penis…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: You sure now?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: … Well alright. But you let me know. You’re
too good a woman to go to waste.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What are you – a 40 in a jacket?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hello… welcome… Come in.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I’ve never been in an apartment above a
store. You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone
really lives in them.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Can I get you anything…coffee… tea…a little
tequilla?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Will it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That all depends on you. …Sure you don’t want
a drink?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: …So he says to me, “you’ll never find another
man like me”…I said, “please, men like you have one hand on their dicks
and the other hand on their mother’s leg… I said, there’s the door -
take a trip.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You threw him out?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: My parents were divorced.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It’s an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt
used to say, “divorce is the sister-in-law of death”.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: …SO…anybody special in your life?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Do I look like I have someone special?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Well, don’t say it like that. It’s not so…ya
know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman… You hold a steady job. Ya
not crossed eyed or anything…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well, there’s nobody special!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I mean, it’s not easy in this day and
age.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Meeting … people.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Tell me about it. I’ve been dating longer than
I’ve been driving. I can’t believe that.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I never really…went through a… dating
period.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It’s a disgusting process. You haven’t missed
anything.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Will you stand still so I can do this!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I’m sorry….I’m just so excited. You must have
felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: In a bar called Hellfire.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Tch…how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn’t already
committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne’d never go for me though. She loves
you too much. And you really love her, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. But that’s not the only reason people get
together or..stay together.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: What are the other reasons?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Survival.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: You love her alot Jack. You’re … crazy about
her…It’s just that, sometimes, you’re a little bit of an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: …My mother calls every week. Like a recurring
nightmare. “So, have you met anyone?”…“No mom”.. “So what’s going to
happen?”… “I don’t know Mom”… I only thank God I moved out.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I can’t believe you lived with her for that
long. If I had to live with my mother, I’d stab myself six times.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I think some people are meant to be alone.
Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now
I’m paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some
of the pleasure parts…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I don’t understand you. What is the
problem?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I don’t feel like I make any impression on
people… At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors
d’oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I
don’t start conversations because I have no idea how to end them…I think
I’m just meant to live in the background of things.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: That’s not true…You gotta ease up…
Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it…We’re
having a lovely conversation.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I’m paying you.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You know, let me tell you something! I’m not
that kind of person. I don’t do people favors. If I talk to you it’s
because I want to. So we’re not all …uh…Jerri Hall…Big deal… What a
boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got.
You’re not so so invisible, ya know… You want make an impression? Try
this; you can be a real bitch.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come here…you’re all crooked. Here’s my
wallet, so you can pay for dinner?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: …You’re a nice man, Jack. Doing all this for
me…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I’m scared Jack.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: …I feel so much for her…I feel like something
awful is going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No. Nothing bad’s going to happen. Anne’ll be
there. I’ll be there. Nothing bad will happen.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I’m still scared.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It’s hard being a woman. I don’t care what
anybody says…People say we have choices - we have <u>no</u> choices…My
grandma used to say that, for a woman in this world, behind every door
there’s either death…or husband.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: “Sister-in-law of death”…That’s
wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anne…! Oh hi? How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Parry, it’s Lydia Sinclair - our membership
winner.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I know!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What are you two up to?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well..everything’s closed up. We thought we’d
get some dinner. Say!….Anybody up for Chinese? Have you eaten? Would you
like to come along?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Oh, no..I have to get home…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: The nails!! Watch the nails!!… Listen, you
still have to eat.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: No really..I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Hey? What did I tell you? Why don’t you come?
It’s just dinner. You’ll have something to tell your mother next time
she calls.</p>
<p><strong>anne, jack, lydia, parry</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: …I..uh..I get to read some of the books but
mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover
publication to paperback. After paperback it’s basically someone else’s
problem.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: It sounds exciting.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Why does it sound exciting? There’s
absolutely nothing exciting about it.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Well, you’re calculating costs that could
have an affect on whether or not the book is published and if it is, it
could be a book that… ….might somehow change the way people think or act
- a book can do that. And you would be a part of creating a cultural
shift that could change our society forever.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Parry!</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: We mostly publish trashy romance novels.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Well - empires have fallen because of trashy
romances…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: …Romance is romance no matter what kind it
is…It could be a Victorian lady kidnapped by a viral sea captain with a
hairy chest…or a horny pizza boy seduced by a housewife with a hairy
upper lip. As long as there’s heart, passion, and little bit of
fantasy…romance is the stuff of dreams…there’s always more to trash than
meets the eye…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: …Hey!</p>
<p><strong>jack/anne</strong>: PARRY!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Parry!…Parry - is that you!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Hey Martin…!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Don’t you look all duded up!</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: This is Lydia!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Nice to meet you Lydia! Got a quarter?!</p>
<p><strong>martin</strong>: Thank you. God bless… Nice girl…Have you set
the date yet?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: How do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on
Sutton Place.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Yep! Right on it!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Huh…the restaurant’s just around the corner
here…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: What do you do - for a living I mean?</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Well, I’m in search of the Holy Grail.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh..I could eat all of these</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Oh..god…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Oh boy…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Can’t take us anywhere, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I think they’re made for each other. And it
scares me.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: SMACK..SMACK…SMACK…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Lydia… Oh Lydia… That encyclopedia. Oh Lydia
the tattooed lady…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Would it be all right… I mean would you mind…
if I walked you home tonight?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I tell ya, I’m very surprised. She seemed to
go for him. Hmmm… There’s somebody for everybody, huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You know, I can’t believe I did it. You think
it’ll work out?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Who’s knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, “some
matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in
hardware stores”.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Nothing it’s just…I begining to understand
you.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Well…I think you should feel very proud. You
did a real nice thing for somebody else. I’m very proud.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You were great. Thanks alot.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Your welcome.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh my.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Tell me more. I want to know everything.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: There isn’t any more to tell.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Don’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: No, really..believe me - there isn’t any
more. This is it.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Well, it’s enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You don’t have to say that.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I never say anything I have to.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: I mean you don’t have to say nice things to
me… That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we’re about to
do.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: What are we about to do?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Well… you’re walking me home. I… I guess
you’re sort of… attracted to me and you’ll want to come upstairs for…
coffee…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I don’t drink coffee…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: … and then we’ll probably have a drink and
talk and get comfortable with each other and… and we’ll… then you’ll
sleep over and then in the morning… … you’ll be distant and you won’t
be… able to stay for breakfast… you’ll just have some coffee maybe…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: I don’t drink coffee…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: And then we’ll exchange phone numbers and
you’ll leave and never call and I’ll go to work and feel great for the
first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch. Why am I
putting myself through this? It was very nice… uh meeting you. Good
night..</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Excuse me…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Listen, I’m not feeling well.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Well, no wonder. We just met, made love and
broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can’t even remember
the first kiss which is the best part.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Listen, you’re very nice… b…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: So are you, but I think maybe you should shut
up now… … I’m not coming up to your apartment. That was never my
idea.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Oh… You mean you don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Oh no, I want to. I’ve got a hard-on for you
the size of Canada… but I don’t… want just one night. I have a
confession to make?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You’re married.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Divorced.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: No, I…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You have a disease.</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Will you stop!… … I’m in love with you…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: … It’s not just from tonight. I’ve known you
for a long time. I see you come out of work every day. I walk with you
to lunch. I know what you order… I see you buy Baby Ruths before going
back in… I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go
into the bookstore… … I know you hate your job and you don’t have many
friends and you sometimes feel like you’re not as… as wonderful as
everybody else and you’re a little uncoordinated … and feeling like
you’re the only one who’s as separate and… alone as you are… and I love
you. I love you. I think you’re the greatest thing since… spice racks
and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first
kiss. But I’ll be back in the morning. And I won’t be distant. And I
will call if you let me… But I still don’t drink coffee.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Shhh…</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: You <u>are</u> real, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: … You can call…</p>
<p><strong>parry</strong>: Let me have this.</p>
<p><strong>leather</strong>: … We’re tired of looking at you people…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Well, ya know, I’m feeling good, Lou… I
don’t know how else to put it… I… I had some personal things to work out
and… and I have and… Yeah… Well, the thing is… I want to work again… I
want to get back into it… you think that’s possible?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I understand… I am… I won’t… I will…
<u>Great</u>! Thanks a lot, Lou… Tuesday’s fine. Okay… Thanks…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: So what’s going on? Who’s Lou again?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: My agent. I called my agent.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You’re kidding! What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: He says if I want to get back to work, no
problem. He wants me to come in and talk and… and… <u>that’s</u>
<u>it</u>!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I’ve got to put these tapes in some kind of
order… and… Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned… … There’s coffee
if you want…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: It’s so great to see you like this, honey… I
can’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Ya know, I’m thinkin’ – with another income
coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: … I don’t want to rush things – you have to
get a job first, but I’m so sure that’s gonna happen I’m not even
thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Ugh, these tapes are a mess. I don’t know
where to begin…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: … I would love to start looking at least. You
know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house – like
in Brooklyn or Staten Island…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: … What?… You don’t want to commute?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, it’s not… Come here…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: You’re an incredible woman Anne…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: “I’m an incredible woman?” What is this, a
death sentence?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, I… I think we should talk about this.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You want to talk? Come on, Jack… Did I cross
the line by mentioning the future or what?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No… it’s just…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Listen, so much has happened and I think it
would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a
little.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Slowed things down? Where have I been? Have we
been going fast!?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Right now, I’m just not sure about… making
such definite plans.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: I’m lost. What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: It’s been a real… real difficult time for me…
The past year or so… And now, for the first time, Anne, I feel like I’m
above water. I feel like I know a lot more than I did, and I don’t want
to make any mistakes so… I think what I need is some time… to make the
right choices. And… I think that maybe… I need to be alone for
awhile.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … I’d like to focus on my career - - now than
I can, now that everything’s all right… Parry’s taken care of… and… Like
I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: First of all, let me tell you something – you
don’t know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you
need? What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>? Have I ever…
ever pressured you!?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: No. So what time do you need? I love you – you
love me – you want to get your career going, great! I’d like to be a
part of it – I think I deserve that! So what do you need to figure out
alone!?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: All right. I’m going to ask you one question.
Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: You can’t even give me that?! What were you
gonna do, Jack?… Just gonna organize your life… … walk out that door,
move in by yourself and what – drop the news when you find somebody
else? What were you planning to do, Jack?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I didn’t know. I just said all I want is some
time.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Bullshit! If you’re going to hurt me, you hurt
me now – not some long… drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life
because you don’t have the balls!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: All right… I’ll pack my stuff tonight.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: What have you been doing here! <u>Huh</u>!
<u>I wanna know</u>! <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Oh yeah? What did I get? What did I get I
couldn’t’ve gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week? You
think your company is such a treat? Your moods, your… “pain”, your
problems… You think you’re entertaining?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Then what do you want to stay with me for?</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: BECAUSE I LOVE YOU!…STUPID!…FUCKIN!…</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: No….You don’t get to be nice now. I’m not
gonna play some game with you where we act like friends so you can walk
out here feeling good about yourself. I’m not a liar. If you’re gonna
leave me then that’s what we call it.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hello?…Yeah…My wallet? What do you mean?….
What?….What?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Parry?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: He can’t hear you. Hi…I’m Dr. Weintraub…. I
was on duty when they brought him in…I’ve been going over his record… He
was brought in once before I understand… …“catatonic stupor”…condition
rendered him non-verbal for a period of -…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah so? The guy’s beat up - he…he probably
has a concussion or something, right? He’ll snap out of it?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: I’m afraid not … Then again, I’m not sure.
The beating’s bad but it’s not the problem… It seems he’s..
re-experiencing the catatonia… So, like before, he could snap out it in
an hour or in thirteen months or thirteen years… ….I don’t know. There’s
no way to tell.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: But..How could that happen?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Well, it’s not unusual in his case…
Sometimes victims of tragedies are subject to the brain’s replay system.
The brain never loses anything - it just stores it up and waits. A
person could actually re-experience the full effect of a tragedy, long
after the event took place. Are you relatives? Well, it doesn’t matter.
We’ll take care of it. He’ll have to be sent back to the same
institution..</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What if I was a relative?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You’d have the option to care for him at
home but my advice is it wouldn’t be the best thing for him. He needs
hospital care. I just thought you could sign the release forms, but the
city can do that. I wouldn’t feel responsible in any way. There’s really
nothing you can do. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>anne</strong>: Just like a guy. Finds the woman of his dreams
then falls into a coma… Poor Lydia… …Some women just have no luck,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Anne….Anne…I’ll call you O.k…?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Well, I’m gone-… Have a perfect weekend and
remember on Monday, we have as our studio guest, Ben Starr - star of the
recently defunct hit TV show ON THE RADIO - it’s the rise and fall story
of one of televisions brightest stars ruined by charges of sodomy in an
Atlanta airport mens room. If you often wonder, “what IS sodomy
exactly?”, Ben’ll have that answer and many more for you on Monday’s
show…Until then, don’t do anything that will break your pattern of being
the selfish scum sucking race you are. From one of the Botched to all of
your bungled cats out there, I love ya and right back at cha!. Over and
out!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Yeah…Yeah Lou…. Lou, I said I want an offer or
they can forget it… Well, tell them I’m meeting with the cable people
about a talk show and…What?… Beth’s father set it up…No, he owns it.
…Fuck you Lou…And if the network is ready to make an offer and I see a
script, then fine… otherwise, forget it…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Hi…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hi..Did you talk to your father?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Yeeesss…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Weeellll!</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Well, Daddy said…and this is word for word… He
said…that he thought… that you were a home run.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Really. He thinks you’ll be a phenominal
success…and he says the cable people are very excited about the meeting…
I said I always knew that and I really think it was like the first time
he really respected me…So thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Jaaack…what are you crazy? They’re people all
around us?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Jaack..I can’t do this…</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: What is this thing you have with the
floor?</p>
<p><strong>beth</strong>: Oh it’s cold…I’m cold…honey… Jack, can we
please do this after dinner.. in bed?…like normal people?…I really want
you but I’ll want you more, late. O.K. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>bum</strong>: JACK!….JACK!….</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: JACK!…JACK! IT’S MEE…REMEMBER ME…YOU KNOW
ME!</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: GET OUTTA HERE I SAID!!…</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: You KNOW that guy!? .</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: JACK…JACK…PLEASE CAN I TALK TO YOU? I
JUST..I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, JACK…I…</p>
<p><strong>gay bum</strong>: JACK..PLEASE..JAAAAAACCKKK!!!! JAACCK!…WHY
WON’T ANYBODY….WHAT’S THE MATTER…</p>
<p><strong>t.v. exec.</strong>: It’s a weekly comedy about the
homeless.</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: Oooooo… I got a rush…</p>
<p><strong>tv exec</strong>: What?… Where is he… Lou, is this another
disappearing act with this guy or what?</p>
<p><strong>lou</strong>: I’m sure it’s nothing… He probably had to go to
the bathroom… I’ll find out…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey! Hey, guys!… Remember me…</p>
<p><strong>black</strong>: Let me the fuck alone, goddamn it…</p>
<p><strong>irishman</strong>: Move it, for Christ sakes.
<u>Move</u>…!!!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey… <u>Hey</u>… Hey wait, I know him…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey… hey, remember me… Marvel Comics, right?…
Remember Parry… Superbum? Remember you guys saved my ass…</p>
<p><strong>paramedic</strong>: Mister, he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: Excuse me but I brought new bed sheets for
him last week. They were lime colored with little watermelons on
them…</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Oh yes… I’m sorry. They’re being cleaned. The
doctor had a little accident with a hypo.</p>
<p><strong>lydia</strong>: All right… Make sure he gets them, okay.
Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Hey… You gonna wake up for me? Huh?…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … This isn’t over is it?… You think you’re
going to make me do this, don’t you?… Well, forget it! No fucking way!…
I don’t feel responsible for you, or for any of them! Everybody has bad
things happen to them… I’m not God. I don’t decide… People survive. Say
something!?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: … Everything’s been going great! <u>Great</u>!
I’m… I’m gonna have my own cable talk show, with an incredible equity I
might add… I… I… have an… an incredibly gorgeous fucking girlfriend… I…
I am living an <u>incredible fucking life</u>!!!… So don’t lay there in
your comfortable little <u>coma</u> and think I’m about to risk all of
that because I feel responsible for you! <u>I am not responsible</u>!
And I don’t feel guilty… You’ve got it easy. I’m out there every day.
Every day trying to figure out what the hell I’m doing… why, no matter
what I have, it feels like I have nothing… So don’t think I feel sorry
for you! It’s easy being nuts! Try being me!… So I won’t do this. I do
not believe in this. And don’t give me that stuff about me <u>being the
one</u>! <u>There</u> <u>is nothing</u>… <u>Nothing special about</u>
<u>me</u>! I control my own destiny – not some overweight fairies. I say
what I’m going to do and <u>I am not risking</u> <u>my life to get some
fucking cup for</u> <u>some fucking vegetable</u>… And even if I did do
this, I want you to know it wouldn’t be because I had to! It wouldn’t be
’cause I feel guilty or cursed or .. or…bad or responsible or
anything….</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Aw shit…If I do this…and I mean, IF!… It’s
because I want to do this… for you. That’s all!! For you! Don’t go
anywhere…huh?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Thank God I live in a city where nobody looks
up…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What the hell am I doing? Can’t fuckin believe
this is my life! …… “Oh Jack you’re the one…we have to get the Grail”
I’ll give ya Grail, ya stupid dingbat! Climbing up walls in the middle
of the goddamn city- in the middle of the goddamn night while that
schmuck lays in bed dreaming about Camelot! I live through this and I’ll
be the King of the Idiots…What a fucking honor!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Oh great. This is great. I’m hearing horses
now. Parry will be so pleased. RADIO PERSONALITY TURNS SCREWBALL ON
MISSION FROM GOD…I just hope when they put me away they find me a bed
right next to his!</p>
