<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: How shall I begin my story that has
no beginning?</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: My name is Esperanza, Esperanza
Quintero. I am a miner’s wife.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: This is our home. The house is
not ours. But the flowers … the flowers are ours.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: This is my village. When I was a
child, it was called San Marcos.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: The Anglos changed the name to
Zinc Town. Zinc Town, New Mexico, U.S.A.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Our roots go deep in this place,
deeper than the pines, deeper than the mine shaft.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: In these arroyos my great
grandfather raised cattle before the Anglos ever came.</p>
<p><strong>property of</strong>: DELAWARE ZINC, INC.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: The land where the mine stands –
that was owned by my husband’s own grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Now it belongs to the company.
Eighteen years my husband has given to that mine.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Living half his life with
dynamite and darkness.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Who can say where it began, my
story? I do not know. But this day I remember as the beginning of an
end.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: It was my Saint’s Day. I was
thirty-five years old. A day of celebration. And I was seven months gone
with my third child.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And on that day – I remember I
had a wish … a thought so sinful …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: … a thought so evil that I prayed
God to forgive me for it. I wished … I wished that my child would never
be born. No. Not into this world.</p>
<p><strong>estella</strong>: Are you sick, Mama?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No, Estellita.</p>
<p><strong>estella</strong>: Are you sad? Are we going to church? For
your confession?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Later. When I finish the ironing.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Fighting again? With those Anglo
kids?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Aah, they think they’re tough.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: But you promised you wouldn’t.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Papa says if an Anglo makes fun of you to let
him have it.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Never mind what your papa …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Hold still … does it hurt?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Naah.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: How come the cake?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Never mind. Go get your father when he
comes off shift. Tell him to come straight home.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Hear you had a little trouble, Quintero.
Defective fuse? Well, you’re all in one piece. So what’s the beef?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You know the beef. This new rule of yours,
that we work alone. We’re taking it up with the Super.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Super’s busy – with your Negotiatin’
Committee.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: So much the better.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Now wait a minute. Super’s the one made the
rule. He ain’t gonna give you no helper.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: He will if he wants us to go on blasting.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Listen, Mr. Barton – there’s blood in that
mine. The blood of my friends. All because they had to work alone …</p>
<p><strong>jenkins</strong>: That’s how ya get splattered over the
rocks, when there’s nobody to help you check your fuses…</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: And nobody to warn the other men to stay
clear.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Warning’s the shift foreman’s job.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Foreman wants to get the ore out. Miner wants
to get his brothers out. In one piece.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You work alone, savvy? You can’t handle the
job, I’ll find someone who can.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Who? A scab?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: An American.</p>
<p><strong>estella</strong>: Mama, can I put the candles …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Hush… not a word about the cake,
hear?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Papa … is there gonna be a strike?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Ram�n … I don’t like to bother you … but
the store lady said if we don’t make a payment on the radio this month,
they’ll take it away.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: We’re only one payment behind. I argued
with her. It isn’t right.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: It isn’t right, she says. Was it right that
we bought this … this instrument?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: But you had to have it, didn’t you? It was so
nice to listen</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I listen to it. Every night. When you’re
out to the beer parlor.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: “No money down. Easy term payments.” I tell
you something: this installment plan, it’s the curse of the working
man.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Got to talk to the brothers.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: This water’s cold again.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I’m sorry. The fire’s gone out.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five
times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks
the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Do you think I like living this way? What do
you want of me?!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: But if your union… if you’re asking for
better conditions … why can’t you ask for decent plumbing, too?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: We did. It got lost in the shuffle.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: We can’t get everything at once. Right now
we’ve got more important demands.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: What’s more important than
sanitation?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: The safety of the men – that’s more
important! Five accidents this week – all because of speed-up. You’re a
woman, you don’t know what it’s like up there.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: First we got to get equality on the job. Then
we’ll work on these other things. Leave it to the men.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I see. The men. You’ll strike, maybe, for
your demands – but what the wives want, that comes later, always
later.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Now don’t start talking against the union
again.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: What has it got me, your union?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Esperanza, have you forgotten what it was
like before the union came? When Estella was a baby, and we couldn’t
even afford a doctor when she got sick? It was for our families! We met
in graveyards to build that union!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: All right. Have your strike. I’ll have my
baby. But no hospital will take me, because I’ll be a striker’s wife.
The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And
we’ll get behind on the payments again, and then they’ll come and take
away the radio…</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Is that all you care about? That radio? Can’t
you think of anything except yourself?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: If I think of myself it’s because you
never think of me. Never. Never. Never…</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Stop it! The children are watching. Stop
it!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Never… never… never!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Aaah, what’s the use?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: They don’t work alone in other mines! Anglos
always work in pairs. So why should I risk my life? Because I’m only a
Mexican?</p>
<p><strong>sal and charley</strong>: But that’s in the demands… we’re
negotiating…</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Three months of negotiations! And nothing
happens! Even with Brother Barnes here from the International, what’ve
we got? No raise. No seniority. No safety code. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Take a drink. Calm down!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I say we gotta take action. Now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Rest of the men feel like you?</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: He speaks for all of us.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Ever stop to think maybe they want us to
strike?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Don’t horse me. Price of zinc’s never been
higher. They don’t want no strike – not with their war boom on.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Then why’s the company hanging tough? They’ve
signed contracts with other locals – why not this one?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Because most of us here are Mexican-
Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners – the same pay,
the same conditions.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Exactly. And equality’s the one thing the
bosses can’t afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals
is, “Well – at least you get more than the Mexicans.”</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too,
but it hurts me more. And I’ve had enough of it!</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: But you don’t pull a strike when the bosses
want it – so they can smash your union. You wait till you’re ready, so
you can win.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids
get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one
payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait?
“Pay – or we take it away.” Why they in such a hurry, the bosses’ store?
They’re trying to scare us, that’s why – to make us afraid to move. To
hang on to what we got – and like it! Well, I don’t like it I’m not
scared … and I’m fed up – to here!</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Hey Ram�n – te buscan!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: What are you doing here? Something wrong with
Mama?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: I thought maybe you forgot…</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Forgot what?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: It’s Mama’s Saint’s Day.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You think I forgot? I was planning a
surprise…</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: What a kid. He can’t wait. It’s my wife’s
Saint’s Day. I was gonna ask you, brothers – how about a ma�anita,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Sure. What time? The later the better…
Wait’ll she’s asleep…</p>
<p><strong>estella</strong>: Why are they singing, Mama?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: They are singing for me.</p>
<p><strong>estella</strong>: Can we light the candles now? On the
cake?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Yes. We will light the candles.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I … I must get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I did not mean to weep again. Why should
I weep for joy?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I’m a fool.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No, no …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Was it expensive, the beer?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Antonio paid for it.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Forgive me … for saying you never thought
of me.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I did forget. Lu�s told me.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: All the next week I kept thinking
about my ma�anita. I had never had so nice a party …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: It was like a song running
through my mind, a humming in my heart, a daydream to lighten the long
days’ work …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: We forgot our troubles at the
ma�anita – even Ram�n …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: I couldn’t dance that night – not
in my condition. But I wasn’t really jealous when he danced with the
others … because it was good just to see him smile again …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And then one morning I was
hanging out my wash.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And while we were talking the
ladies came. They were a kind of delegation. It was about the
sanitation, they said …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: The Anglo miners have bathrooms
and hot running water, Consuelo said, why shouldn’t we?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I know, I spoke to Ram�n about it – only
a week ago.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: And what did he say?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: They dropped it from their demands.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Es lo de siempre.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: We got to make them understand – make the
men face up to it. Show her the sign.</p>
<p><strong>we want sanitation</strong>: NOT DISCRIMINATION</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: We’ll make a lot of signs like this. Then
we’ll get all the wives together and go right up to the mine.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: To the mine?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Sure. Where they’re negotiating. In the
company office. We’ll go up there and picket the place.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Then both sides will see we mean
business.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: A picket line? Of … of ladies?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Sure. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>luz</strong>: You can count me in.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Luz!</p>
<p><strong>luz</strong>: Listen, we ought to be in the wood choppers’
union. Chop wood for breakfast. Chop wood to wash his clothes. Chop
wood, heat the iron. Chop wood, scrub the floor. Chop wood, cook his
dinner. And you know what he’ll say when he gets home … “What you been
doing all day? Reading the funny papers?”</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Come on, Esperanza – how about it? We got
to.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No. No. I can’t. If Ram�n ever found me
on a picket line …</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: He’d what? Beat you?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No … No …</p>
<p><strong>luz</strong>: … accidente …</p>
<p><strong>luz</strong>: It’s Mr. Kalinsky.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kalinsky</strong>: Let me see him! Let me see him!</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Now Mrs. Kalinsky, he’s gonna be all right
… His leg’s broken, that’s all … Come on now, you can see him in the
hospital …</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: How did it happen?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: He wandered into a drift – when this fellow
was blasting.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I told you it would happen. It’s bound to
happen when a man works alone!</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Why didn’t you give a warning signal?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Your foreman says that’s a foreman’s job.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: I checked the drift just before he blasted.
It was all clear … The man must have been asleep or something.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You weren’t even there. You were back at the
station. Kalinsky told me …</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: You’re a liar, Pancho. A no-good, dirty
…</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: D�jame! I’ll kill him! Hold him! Hold him!
… Basta, Ram�n! All right, all right. Break it up …</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: You, there. Get a hold on yourself. A
man’s been hurt. I’m as sorry about it as you are. Savvy?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Accidents are costly to everyone – and to
the company most of all. And now, I see no reason to treat the occasion
like a paid holiday. Suppose we all get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Mr. Barton.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: All right, fellows, the excitement’s over.
Let’s get to it.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: …’hora. … S�, yo creo que s�.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: What are they saying?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: No savvy.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Well, Barnes? How about it? Tell them to
get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They don’t work for me. I work for them.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Ruiz?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: It’s up to you, brothers.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Cente!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n’s voice</strong>: Ap�galo!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: That night the men held a union
meeting … just to make the walk-out official.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: It didn’t take them long. They
voted to strike – 93 to 5.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: … And Teresa said now was the
time for us to go in. I didn’t want to … I had never been to a union
meeting. But the others said, one go, all go …</p>
<p><strong>charley vidal</strong>: We have many complaints, brothers,
and many demands. But they all add up to one word: Equality!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: The meeting was nearly over when
we came in. Charley Vidal was making a speech. He said there was only
one issue in this strike – equality. But the mine owners would stop at
nothing to keep them from getting equality.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: He said the bosses would try to
split the Anglo and Mexican-American workers and offer rewards to one
man if he would sell out his brother… There was only one answer to that,
Charley said – solidarity. The solidarity of working men.</p>
<p><strong>charley vidal</strong>: To all this, brothers, there is only
one answer, the solidarity of working men!</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Yes? You ladies have an announcement?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: Well – it’s not an announcement, I guess.
The ladies wanted me to …</p>
<p><strong>voice from the floor</strong>: Louder!</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Consuelo, will you speak from over here?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: The ladies have been talking about
sanitation … and we were thinking … if the issue is equality, like you
say it is, then maybe we ought to have equality in plumbing too …</p>
<p><strong>consuelo’s voice</strong>: I mean, maybe it could be a strike
demand … and some of the ladies thought – it might be a good idea to
have a ladies auxiliary! Well, we would like to help out .. . if we can
…</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: I’m sure I can speak for all of the brothers.
We appreciate the ladies offering to help, but it’s getting late and I
suggest we table it. The chair will entertain a motion to adjourn.</p>
<p><strong>first miner</strong>: Move to adjourn!</p>
<p><strong>second miner</strong>: Second!</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: So ordered.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Why didn’t you check with me? It’s
embarrassing!</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Why didn’t you support her? You’re the worst
of the lot.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But honey …</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Or why don’t you just put a sign outside? “No
dogs or women allowed!”</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: But, Teresa, you can’t push these things
too fast.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: You were pushing all right – pushing us
right back in our place.</p>
<p><strong>first miner</strong>: That’s a pretty good idea – making
sanitation one of the demands again.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: At least you didn’t make a fool of yourself –
like Consuelo.</p>
<p><strong>delaware zinc co., inc.</strong>: KEEP OUT</p>
<p><strong>miners on strike</strong>: WE WANT EQUALITY</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And so it began – much like any
other strike. There would be no settlement, the company said, till the
men returned to their jobs. But their back-to-work movement didn’t
work.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And so the company recruited a
few strike-breakers from out of town.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: But they usually lost their nerve
when they saw the size of the picket line.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: The Sheriff’s men were always
there. They stood around, showing off their weapons. But the men only
marched, day after day, week after week …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: At first it was a kind of
unwritten rule that the women stay at home. The union gave us rations
and we had to figure out how to feed our families on them …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: But then one morning Mrs. Salazar
went to the picket line. Her husband had been killed in a strike many
years before … and she wanted to be there.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Nobody remembers just how it
happened, but one day Mrs. Salazar started marching with them … and she
kept on marching with them.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: After a while some of the women
began to bring coffee for their husbands … and maybe a couple of tacos –
because a man gets tired and hungry on picket duty …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: It was about that time the union
decided maybe they’d better set up a Ladies Auxiliary after all.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: I didn’t come to the lines at
first. My time was near – and besides, Ram�n didn’t approve. But Ram�n
is a man who loves good coffee. And he swore the other ladies made it
taste like zinc sludge …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: So one day I made the coffee
…</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Now let’s see … who’s missing? Prieto,
Sebastian. Prieto?</p>
<p><strong>second miner</strong>: Haven’t seen him for two days.</p>
<p><strong>jenkins</strong>: Hey, Ram�n – listen to this. The chief
foreman come to me last night, said he’d make me shift foreman if I’d
start a back-to-work movement. “Jenkins,” he says, “why string along
with them tamale eaters?” I just told him I come to like tamales
fine.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Two scabs got through on the other side of
the hill. We chased the rest back.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Recognize them?</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Anglos. From out of town. But they’re not
miners – I could tell that. They don’t know zinc from Shinola.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Okay. Take five. Get yourself some
coffee.</p>
<p><strong>first miner</strong>: Hey, Ram�n, here comes the super …</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: You can get the best view of the layout
from here. That’s their main picket line. They have another post on the
back road, and roving patrols …</p>
<p><strong>hartwell’s voice</strong>: On company property? Why don’t you
have them thrown off?</p>
<p><strong>alexander’s voice</strong>: But it’s all company property,
Mr. Hartwell – the stores, the housing area, everything. Where do you
throw them? And who does the throwing?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Mornin’.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Well, those new fellows you hired from out
of town – we brought ’em up here in a truck this morning, but they took
one look at that picket line and turned tail.</p>
<p><strong>hartwell</strong>: They don’t look so rough to me.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Well, Mr. Hartwell, they’ve got some pretty
tough hombres, ’specially that picket captain there – what’s his name …
Ray, Raymond something-or-other …</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Oh yes. I know that one.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Now why don’t you let these gentlemen pass?
Don’t you know who’s in that car?</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: It’s the paymaster from Moscow – with our
gold.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: No, no, it’s the president of the company
himself – come all the way out here to make Jenkins general manager. So
why you acting so mean?</p>
<p><strong>hartwell</strong>: Aren’t they going to let us pass?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Eventually. This is just a little ritual
to impress us with their power.</p>
<p><strong>hartwell</strong>: Childish.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Well, they’re like children in many ways.
Sometimes you have to humor them, sometimes you have to spank them – and
sometimes you have to take their food away. Here comes the one we were
talking about.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: He’s quite a character. Claims his
grandfather once owned the land where the mine is now.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Want to go up to your office,
Mr. Alexander?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Naturally. You think I parked here for a
cup of coffee?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You’re welcome to one.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: The men would like to know who this gentleman
is.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: That’s none of their affair.</p>
<p><strong>hartwell</strong>: That’s all right – it’s no secret. My
name’s Hartwell. I’m from the company’s Eastern office.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You mean Delaware?</p>
<p><strong>hartwell</strong>: No. New York.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: New York? You’re not the Company President by
any chance?</p>
<p><strong>hartwell</strong>: No …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Too bad. The men’ve always wanted to get a
look at the President. But you’ve come out here to settle the
strike?</p>
<p><strong>hartwell</strong>: Well, if that’s possible …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: It’s possible. Just negotiate.</p>
<p><strong>hartwell</strong>: Are we talking to a union spokesman?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Not exactly. But I wish he were one. He
knows more about mining than those pie-cards we’ve had to deal with.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I mean it. I know your work record. You
were in line for foreman when this trouble started – did you know that?
You had a real future with this company, but you let those Reds stir you
up. And now they’ll sell you down the river. Why don’t you wake up, Ray?
That’s your name, isn’t it, Ray?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: No. My name is Quintero. Mister Quintero.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Are you going to let us pass – or do I
have to call the Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: There’s nothing stopping you.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I was wrong! They don’t want Jenkins for
general manager – they want me!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You shoulda heard that guy. What a line! I
was up for foreman, he says. F�jate!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: It’s nothing. Just a little catch …</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Papa! Papa! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Is that Lu�s? What’s he doing? Playing hookey
again?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Lu�s! Come down here!</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Papa! We seen ’em! Two scabs! Over there!</p>
<p><strong>second boy</strong>: They’re hiding in the gully. Over
there!</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: Qu� dijo? He’s spotted two scabs … Where?
Over in the gully … Come on, let’s get ’em …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Hold it, brothers! You – Antonio – Alfredo –
Cente – you come with me. The rest stay on the line.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Lu�s! Lu�s! Come back here!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Prieto … Sebastian Prieto …</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ram�n … listen for the love of God …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You … You … I’d expect it of an Anglo, yes …
but you …</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ram�n … listen to me … I’m in a jam … I
had to get a job …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You Judas … blood-sucker …</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: Ram�n – listen my kids …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: T�! Traidor a tu gente! Rompehuelga!
Desgraciado!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: My kids don’t have enough to eat!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You think my kids have enough to eat, you
rat?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: I know, it’s wrong. Just let me go. I’ll
leave town … just let me go.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You think I was going to work you over? I
wouldn’t dirty my hands with you …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Lu�s! Lu�s! The baby …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: The baby! Get the women!
Quick!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Why do you stop?</p>
<p><strong>kimbrough</strong>: Wanna have a talk with you – ’bout why
you slugged that fellow back there.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: That’s a lie. I didn’t–</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: Now you know that ain’t no way to talk to a
white man.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. salazar</strong>: Go back and get a blanket, you idiots!
So we can carry her!</p>
<p><strong>kimbrough</strong>: Hey, Vance. You said this bull-fighter
was full of pepper. He don’t look so peppery now.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: Oh, but he is. He’s full of chile, this
boy.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: He likes it hot. His chiquita makes it good
and hot for him – don’t she, Pancho?</p>
<p><strong>ext., road</strong>: ANOTHER SHERIFF’S CAR:NEAR PICKET LINE.
MEDIUM SHOT.</p>
<p><strong>kalinsky</strong>: Sheriff … we need a doctor – quick. A
lady’s gonna have a baby …</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: What d’ya take me for? An ambulance
driver?</p>
<p><strong>kalinsky</strong>: But there’s a company doctor in town. We
don’t have a car. If you’d just go, get him …</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You kiddin’? Company doctor won’t come to
no picket line.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. salazar</strong>: We can’t get her home … there isn’t
time. Take her inside …</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: Hold your head up, Pancho. That ain’t no way
to sit.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I’ll outlive you all, you lice.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: How’s that? What’s that Spic talk?</p>
<p><strong>now the intercutting becomes very rapid.</strong>: THE SHOTS
ARE BRIEF FLASHES.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: God forgive me … wishing … this child
would never be born.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Mother of God …have mercy …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Have mercy on this child … let this child
live …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Oh, my God … Esperanza … Esperanza …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Ram�n …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Ram�n was in the hospital for a
week … and then in the county jail for thirty days … charged with
assault and resisting arrest. But I made up my mind to postpone the
christening till he could be there.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: … And so the baby was baptized
the day Ram�n got out of jail. Antonio was his godfather, and Teresa
Vidal his godmother. We christened him Juan.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: That night we had a double
celebration: Juanito’s christening, Ram�n’s homecoming.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And we put all the children to
sleep in the bedroom, as usual.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And the ladies adjourned to the
kitchen – as usual.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And the men took over the parlor
– as usual.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Five thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Beats.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Raise you ten thousand.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: You dog. All right, let’s see them.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Aces, wired. Come to papa.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Hear those deputies slugged ’Cente.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah. Lots of provocation lately. They figure
if they can lock up the leadership on some phony riot charge, maybe they
can bust the strike.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Are we gonna let them play poker all night? I
want to dance.</p>
<p><strong>luz</strong>: With whose husband?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: With any of them – even my own.</p>
<p><strong>luz</strong>: If you dance with my husband, you’ll have to
put up with this …</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos.
If you’re gonna be a leader …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: What attitude?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You lump them all together – Anglo workers and
Anglo bosses.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: He’s a guest in my house, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Sure. But you want the truth? You’re even
suspicious of him.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Maybe. I think he’s got a few things to learn
about our people.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Go on. Spill it.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Well, you’re the organizer. You work out
strike strategy – and most of the time you’re dead right. But when you
figure everything the rank-and-file’s to do down to the last detail, you
don’t give us anything to think about. You afraid we’re too lazy to take
initiative?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You know I don’t think that.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Maybe not. But there’s another thing … like
when you came in tonight – I heard you ask your wife, “Who’s that? His
grandfather?”</p>
<p><strong>ram�n’s voice</strong>: That’s Ju�rez – the father of Mexico.
If I didn’t know a picture of George Washington, you’d say I was an
awful dumb Mexican.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I’ve never seen it fail. Try to give Ram�n
a friendly criticism and he throws it right back in your face.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. He’s right. I’ve got a lot to learn.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Now we’ve got that settled, deal the
cards.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: If it makes you feel any better, he’s got even
less use for women.</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: What are they talking about in there?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Discussing each other’s weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>luz</strong>: I didn’t know they had any.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Right now, Ram�n’s on the receiving end.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Let’s break up that game.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If the women are shut off from life in the
union …</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Bet your hand!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We can’t think of them just as housewives –
but as allies. And we’ve got to treat them as such.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Look who’s talking! The Great White Father,
and World’s Champion of Women’s Rights.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Aw, cut it out, Ruth.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Me, I’m a camp follower – following this
organizer from one mining camp to another – Montana, Colorado, Idaho.
But did he ever think to organize the women? No. Wives don’t count in
the Anglo locals either.</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Not that I like the way you treat your wife.
But when Doctor Barnes gives you his cure-all for female troubles, ask
him if he’s tried it at home.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Hey, Esperanza!</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: Esperanza’s nursing the baby.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: There goes the game.</p>
<p><strong>luz</strong>: Good. Consuelo, turn up the radio Come on,
Papa, on your feet.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Look at him …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: A fighter, huh?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: He was born fighting. And born
hungry.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Drink, drink, Juanito. You’ll never have it
so good.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: He’ll have it good. Some day.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: What were they saying? About you? In
there?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: They say I am no good to you.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: You are no good to me – in jail.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I’d lie on my cot in the cell and I couldn’t
sleep with the bugs and the stink and the heat. And I’d say to myself,
think of something nice. Something beautiful. And then I’d think of you.
And my heart would pound against the cot for love of you.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Not just Juanito. You’ll have it good too,
Esperanza. We’re going to win this strike.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: What makes you so sure?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Because if we lose, we lose more than a
strike. We lose the union. And the men know this. And if we win, we win
more than a few demands. We win… … something bigger. Hope. Hope for our
kids. Juanito can’t grow strong on milk alone.</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: :This the Quintero place?</p>
<p><strong>kimbrough’s voice</strong>: We don’t like to break in on you
like this, but this fella owns the radio store, he got himself a
repossession order on this radio here.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n’s voice</strong>: Don’t touch it.</p>
<p><strong>kimbrough’s voice</strong>: I don’t want no trouble,
Quintero. We got orders to repossess this machine.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n’s voice</strong>: I said … don’t touch it.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Let them take it!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Over my dead body.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I don’t want your dead body. I don’t want
you back in jail either.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: But it’s yours. I won’t let them …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Can’t you see they want to start a fight
so that they can lock you all up at one time?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: What are you so sad about?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Let’s hear some real music for a change.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: But the strike did not end. Ram�n
was wrong. It went on and on, into the fourth month, the fifth, the
sixth. The company still refused to negotiate. We couldn’t buy food at
the company store …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: They tried to turn people against
us. They printed lies about us in their newspapers …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: They tried to turn the Anglo
millers against us. They said that all the Mexicans ought to be sent
back where they came from. But the men said …</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: How can I go back where I came from? The
shack I was born in is buried under company property.</p>
<p><strong>kalinsky</strong>: Why don’t nobody ever tell the bosses to
go back where they came from?</p>
<p><strong>cente</strong>: Wouldn’t be no bosses in the state of New
Mexico if they did.</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Brother! Live to see the day.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Jenkins ain’t no boss. Mean we’re gonna let
people like Jenkins stay here?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You can’t send him back to Oklahoma. It’d be
inhumane.</p>
<p><strong>jenkins</strong>: But I was born in Texas.</p>
<p><strong>antonio and alfredo</strong>: Oh no. That’s even worse.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And the seventh month came. By
now the strike fund was nearly gone. A few families couldn’t take it any
longer. They packed up and moved away – and where they went we do not
know …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And so it was decided by the
union that hardship cases should seek work in other mines. And this was
done. And the strikers who found jobs divided their pay with the union,
so the rest of us might eat.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Ram�n was not a hardship case.
Only three children to feed. No – the Quintero family was not hungry all
the time. Just most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Even so, the mine owners might
have starved us out were it not for the help we got from our
International in Denver, and from the other locals. … And we who thought
no one outside our county knew of our troubles, or cared if they did
know – found we were wrong.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Letters came. From our own
people, the Spanish-speaking people of the Southwest … and from far away
– Butte, Chicago, Birmingham, New York – messages of solidarity and the
crumpled dollar bills of working men.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: But that was not all – we women
were helping. And not just as cooks and coffee makers. A few of the men
made jokes about it, but the work had to be done – so they let us
stay.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: No one knew how great a change it
was, till the day of the crisis …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: That was the day when the Sheriff
and the Marshall came. The Sheriff was smiling – so we knew he brought
bad news.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: The company had got a court
injunction ordering the strikers to stop picketing. A Taft-Hartley
injunction, they called it. It meant heavy fines and jail sentences for
the strikers if they disobeyed.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: A decision had to be made at once
– whether to obey the order, or not.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If we obey the court, the strike will be lost
… the scabs would move in as soon as the pickets disappear. If we defy
the court, the pickets will be arrested and the strike will be lost
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So there it is brothers. The bosses have us
coming and going. I just want to say this – no matter which way you
decide, the International will back you up – as it’s always backed you
up. This is a democratic union. The decision’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: If we give up now, if we obey this rotten
Taft-Hartley law, we give up everything it’s taken us fifty years to
gain. There is only one answer: fight them! Fight them all!</p>
<p><strong>other miners</strong>: :How? They’ll arrest us! We gain
nothing.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: The men quarreled. They made
brave speeches. It seemed that Brother Barnes was right – the company
had them coming and going. It seemed the strike was lost.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Brother Chairman, if you read the court
injunction carefully you will see that it only prohibits striking miners
from picketing. We women are not striking miners. We will take over your
picket line.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Don’t laugh. We have a solution. You have
none. Brother Quintero was right when he said we’ll lose fifty years of
gains if we lose this strike. Your wives and children too. But this we
promise – if the women take your places on the picket line, the strike
will not be broken, and no scabs will take your jobs.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: If that’s a motion … only members of the union
can make a motion.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: I so move!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Second!</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: You’ve heard the motion. The floor is open for
debate.</p>
<p><strong>miner</strong>: If we allow our women to help us, we’ll be
the joke of the whole labor movement!</p>
<p><strong>another miner</strong>: Look, brother, our women are ours,
our countrywomen! Why shouldn’t they help us?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And Luz asked which was worse, to
hide behind a woman’s skirt, or go down on his knees before the
boss?</p>
<p><strong>gonzales</strong>: We haven’t counted enough on our women.
The bosses haven’t counted on them at all.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Will the bosses win now because we have no
unity between the men and their wives and sisters?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And Carlotta S�nchez said she
didn’t think picketing was proper for ladies. It wasn’t nice. Maybe even
a sin.</p>
<p><strong>gonzales</strong>: I say give the sisters a chance …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: And what will happen when the cops come, and
beat our women up? Will we stand there? Watch them? No. We’ll take over
anyway, and we’ll be right back where we are now. Only worse. Even more
humiliated. Brothers, I beg you – don’t allow this.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: All right. The question’s been called. You
brothers know what you’re voting on – that the sisters of the auxiliary
take over the picket line. All those in favor will so signify …</p>
<p><strong>teresa’s voice</strong>: Brother Chairman! A point of
order!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I don’t know anything … about these
questions of parliament. But you men are voting on something the women
are to do, or not to do. So I think it’s only fair the women be allowed
to vote – especially if they have to do the job.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Brothers … and sisters. It would be
unconstitutional to permit women to vote at a union meeting. If there’s
no objection, we could adjourn this meeting …</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: No, wait, wait … and reconvene this meeting as
a community mass meeting with every adult entitled to a vote!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I so move!</p>
<p><strong>second voice</strong>: Second!</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: All those in favor will raise their hands. Now
those opposed … The ayes have it! Now, every adult is entitled to a
vote!</p>
<p><strong>women’s voices</strong>: Question! Question! Call the
question!</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Those in favor that the sisters take over the
picket line will so signify by raising their hands.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Okay. All those opposed?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: The motion has carried – a hundred and three to
eighty-five.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And so they came, the women …
they rose before dawn and they came, wives, daughters, grandmothers.
They came from Zinc Town and the hills beyond, from other mining camps,
ten, twenty, thirty miles away …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: By sun-up there were a hundred on
the line. And they kept coming–women we had never seen before, women who
had nothing to do with the strike. Somehow they heard about a women’s
picket line – and they came.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And the men came too. They looked
unhappy. I think they were afraid. Afraid the women wouldn’t stand fast
– or maybe afraid they would.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: But not all the women went to the
picket post. Some were forbidden by their husbands. I was one of
these.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: It’s not fair … I should be there with
them. After all, I’m the one who got the women the vote.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: But the motion passed. It’s … it’s not
democratic of you to …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: The union don’t run my house. Those Anglo
dames stirred you up to make fools of yourselves – but you don’t see any
of them down there.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Yes, I do. There’s Ruth Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: She’s the organizer’s, wife. She’s got to be
there.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: NO, she wants to be there. And there’s
Mrs. Kalinsky.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: There’s Jenkins’ wife. You don’t see her on
no picket line.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Anglo husbands can also be backward.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Can be what?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Backward.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Can’t I even put in an
appearance?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n’s voice</strong>: In heaven’s name, woman, with a baby
in your arms?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: The baby likes to be walked. It helps him
burp.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: Hey, girls! Wait a minute! Don’t you wanta
see my pistol?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Shut up. What’s so amusing? They’re
flaunting a court order.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Not so sure about that. Letter of the Law,
you know. All the injunction says is no picketing by miners.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Whose side are you on anyway?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Now don’t get excited, Mr. Alexander.
They’ll scatter like a covey of quail.</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Well, let’s get at it – before another
hundred dames show up.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: All right, boys.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: What about these?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Forget it. They’ll scatter like quail.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. salazar</strong>: Get back! Get back! Stay out of
this!</p>
<p><strong>first miner</strong>: But they’re beating up my wife!</p>
<p><strong>women</strong>: It’ll be worse if you get in it. Then they’ll
start shooting … They’ll throw you in jail! We can take care of
ourselves … You’re not needed here Get back! Get back!</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Why are you standing there? Do something!</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Relax.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: But women are getting hurt! We’ve gotta take
over!</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: They’re doing all right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Anyway, looks like you’ve got your hands
full.</p>
<p><strong>estella</strong>: Papa, I’m hungry.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: So’m I.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Where’s your mama?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: She’s coming. Charley Vidal gave her a
lift.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Boy! Did you see the way Mama whopped that
deputy with her shoe? Knocked the gun right out …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I don’t want you hanging around there,
hear?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Must’ve been some experience for you,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I guess you got enough today to last a
lifetime, huh?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I’m going back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You might get hurt. Listen, if you think I’m
gonna play nursemaid from now on, you’re crazy … I’ve had these kids all
day!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I’ve had them since the day they were
born.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I’m telling you. I don’t stay home with these
kids tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids
with me to the picket line.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: And so I came back the next day –
and every day for the next month …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: I kept Juanito in the coffee
shack, and when the weather was good and there was peace on the line I
brought his crib outside. Estella played with the little ones, and Lu�s
…</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: … Lu�s was in school.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Ram�n came every day and sat on
the hillside, just watching. The ladies – well, they criticized Ram�n
for not keeping the kids.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: For a while the Sheriff’s men
left us alone. But then it started again. They cursed us, insulted us,
called us foul names. It started again.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: They used tear gas again. This
time the wind was against us.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: When that happened we spread out,
as we had planned, and I took the baby away from the danger, as we had
planned.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: But they couldn’t break our line.
They couldn’t break it …</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I’ve tried everything but shootin’ ’em
down.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: You haven’t tried locking them up!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You want ’em all arrested?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: No, just the ring leaders. The
fire-eaters. And the ones with big families … Barton – where’s that
boy?</p>
<p><strong>barton</strong>: Hey, you – c’mere.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Awright, girls – I’m gonna give you a
choice – you can go home or you can go to jail. No ifs, ands or buts.
Git off the picket line or git arrested.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Okay. Point ’em out.</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: That one – Teresa Vidal. She’s the
leader.</p>
<p><strong>kimbrough</strong>: You’re under arrest. Home or the hoosegow
– what’s it gonna be?</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Keep marching sisters. Let’s show some
discipline.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. kalinsky</strong>: But Teresa, we …</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: They’ll charge us with resisting arrest.
Keep marching!</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: And Mrs. Salazar … the old one. And Chana
D�az – that one, in the blue dress. And Luz Morales, the little one,
shaking her fist … and Mrs. Kalinsky, the Anglo … and Ruth Barnes, she’s
the organizer’s wife …</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: :… And Lala Alvarez, the pretty one over
there. And that one.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: With the baby?</p>
<p><strong>sebastian</strong>: She’s Ram�n Quintero’s wife. He don’t
like her being here at all.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: We’ll take the baby, Esperanza … Don’t
worry about Juanito … We’ll keep Estella too …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No. The baby stays with me. Go to Papa.
You stay with Papa, hear?</p>
<p><strong>women</strong>: Queremos comida … Queremos camas … Queremos
ba�os … Queremos comida …</p>
<p><strong>turnkey</strong>: Now listen! Please, girls! Be quiet!
Listen! I’ve told you ten times. We don’t have no food. We don’t have no
beds. We don’t have no baths. So please – please – shut up!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: He can’t drink this milk. It’ll make him
sick. He’s on a formula. I was a fool! I shouldn’t have kept him with
me.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Don’t you worry. We’ll get some action.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: The baby can’t drink this store milk. We
want his formula!</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: You want what?</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: The formula, the formula …</p>
<p><strong>women</strong>: We want the formula! We want the formula!</p>
<p><strong>d.a.</strong>: Well, you can get the J.P. to swear out peace
bonds. Or heist the bail high enough so you can keep ’em in jail.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Keep ’em? What am I supposed to do – feed
’em outa my own pocket?</p>
<p><strong>hartwell</strong>: The company has other mines. You’ve got to
see the larger picture. Once these people get out of hand …</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: What you doin’ here? Ain’t you seen enough of
me?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I come for my kids. They’re in your jail.</p>
<p><strong>hartwell’s voice</strong>: Not every trump.</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: I can’t shut them dames up. They keep yellin’
about the formula.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: Formula for the baby or somethin’. His
kid.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Now look here. I got you some milk for the
baby. So what’s all the belly-achin’ about?</p>
<p><strong>ad lib</strong>: It’s no good, the milk… Queremos la formula
… The baby has a formula … If Juanito gets sick you’ll be responsible
…</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: I’m not running a drug store. You girls got
nobody but yourselves to 1 blame and you can be home with your families
in an hour. All you have to do is sign a pledge that you won’t go back
to the picket line.</p>
<p><strong>many voices</strong>: Don’t sign nothin’ for the stinker. No,
no deals, no deals … Make him get the formula.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Where’d that fellow go?</p>
<p><strong>vance</strong>: Hey, Pancho, c’mere!</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Awright. Where’s the baby? And the little
girl?</p>
<p><strong>voices</strong>: Queremos comida … Queremos camas … Queremos
ba�os … Queremos comida …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Will you kids get out of those baskets!</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: How goes it?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: It never ends.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Three hours! Just to heat enough water to
wash this stuff! I tell you something. If this strike is ever settled –
which I doubt – I don’t go back to work unless the company installs hot
running water for us. It should’ve been a union demand from the
beginning.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: It’s like Charley Vidal says – there’s two
kinds of slavery, wage slavery and domestic slavery. The Woman Question,
he calls it.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: The woman question?</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Question, question – the problem, what to
do about ’em.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: So? What does he want to do about ’em?</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: He says give ’em equality. Equality in
jobs, equality in the home. Also sex equality.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: What do you mean – sex equality?</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: You know … What’s good for the goose is
good for the gander.</p>
<p><strong>antonio’s voice</strong>: He’s some organizer, that Charley.
He can organize a wife right out of your home.</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: Papa, can’t I leave now? There’s a meeting of
the Junior Shop Stewards …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: The what!</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: The Junior Shop Stewards. There’s lots of ways
we can help.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Don’t I have enough troubles without them
shipping you off to reform school?</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: But Papa – you need all the help you can
get.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You’ve got to help around the house!</p>
<p><strong>luis</strong>: But you’ve got me doing everything. Mama never
used to make me dry the …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You should have helped her without being
asked.</p>
<p><strong>charley’s voice</strong>: Buenas noches!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Hasta ma�ana, Charley.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: How do you feel?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I’m okay. But it’s nice to be home.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Four nights. How did you sleep?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: We raised such a fuss they finally
brought cots in.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I nearly lost my voice, yelling so much.
How’s Estellita? And the baby?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: They’re asleep.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Did you have to sign a pledge? Not to go back
to the line?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No, no … we wouldn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: But if you go back they’ll lock you up
again.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No, no … the Sheriff had enough of us. We
drove him crazy.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: It’s all set. Consuelo’s squad can take they
day off tomorrow. We’re taking over.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Good. Come in, we’ll work it out. Sit
down, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: We’ve got to have a talk, you and me.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: All right, but later. I’ve got a meeting
now.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: A meeting?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Yes. To plan for the picket line
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Now – let’s see … who’s
available?</p>
<p><strong>teresa’s voice</strong>: Chana’s husband is out of town – on
that delegation to see the governor. And Anita Gonzales’ husband, too
…</p>
<p><strong>consuelo’s voice</strong>: And six or seven others – Lala’s
husband and Mariana’s …</p>
<p><strong>ruth</strong>: And there’s a whole bunch of men going on a
fuel hunting expedition – thirty or forty of them – so their wives are
out too.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: But we can ask them to keep our kids, so
the rest of us can …</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: What are you going to do about him,
Esperanza?</p>
<p><strong>consuelo</strong>: It’s time he was house broken. Maybe if a
delegation of us talked to him …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No, no … I have to work it out with him
myself.</p>
<p><strong>anglo miner</strong>: I got a friend, he’s got a friend in
the Bureau of Mines. Know what he says? They ain’t never gonna open up
that mine again.</p>
<p><strong>fourth miner</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>anglo miner</strong>: He says the ore’s played out. So help
me.</p>
<p><strong>cente</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Bull. Lotta bull. That’s a rich mine. I
know.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: But what’s the difference? They’ll never
settle with us. Never.</p>
<p><strong>antonio’s voice</strong>: Hey! Hey! What d’ya know!</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: It’s him! It’s him! El Presidente! The
President of the Company.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: Listen to this: “MAN OF DISTINCTION. J.
Hamilton Miller, financier, Business executive, Board Chairman of
Continental Factors, and president of Delaware Zinc Incorporated. An
enthusiastic sportsman and expert marksman, Mr. Miller manages to find
time every year for an African safari. He leaves this month for Kenya,
where he hopes to bag his thirteenth lion!”</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: I’m gonna frame this. Hey, Ram�n –
look.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Got to look at the larger picture.</p>
<p><strong>jenkins</strong>: How do you like that? The guy is a lion
hunter.</p>
<p><strong>antonio</strong>: What d’you expect him to hunt –
rabbits?</p>
<p><strong>fourth miner</strong>: Man, oh man, I’d sure like to get me
some venison.</p>
<p><strong>cente</strong>: I ain’t tasted meat in four weeks. How about
it, Ram�n? Let’s take off for a couple of days, huh?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Why ask me? Am I runnin’ this strike? If you
want permission to go over the hill, go ask the Ladies Auxiliary.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I waited up till midnight.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You weren’t waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: That meeting only lasted ten minutes. The
first night I’m home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can’t
you bear the sight of me?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Be still …</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: But you wanted to talk. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: We can’t go on this way. I just can’t go on
living with you. Not this way.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No. We can’t can’t go on this way. We
can’t go back to the old way either.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: The old way? What’s your “new way”? What’s it
mean? Your “right” to neglect your kids?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Hunting.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Sun up.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Alone?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Ram�n – you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Why not? I’m not needed here.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: But you are needed. Especially now – with
most of the other men away. You’re captain of the stand-by squad.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Sure, the standby squad. Stand-by for the
funeral.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Whose funeral? We’re doing all right.
There hasn’t been a scab near the picket line for three days.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: And you know why? Because the company knows
they can starve us out – even if it takes another two, three months.
What’s it to them if the mine’s shut down a little longer?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: It’s a lot to them. They’d do anything to
open that mine.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Aah! They’ve got other mines. You don’t see
the larger picture. They’ve got millions. Millions. They can outlast us,
and they know it.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: You mean you’re ready to give up?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Who said anything about giving up? I’ll never
go back to the company on my knees. Never.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: You want to go down fighting, is that it?
I don’t want to go down fighting. I want to win.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Ram�n were not getting weaker. We’re
stronger than ever before. They’re getting weaker. They thought they
could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can’t win
unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I don’t know. But I can feel it coming.
It’s like … like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Charley Vidal says! Don’t throw Charley Vidal
up to me!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Charley’s my friend. I need friends. Why
are you afraid to have me as your friend?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I don’t know what you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No, you don’t. Have you learned nothing
from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you
still think you can have dignity only if I have none?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You talk of dignity? After what you’ve been
doing?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses
look down on you, and you hate them for it. “Stay in your place, you
dirty Mexican” – that’s what they tell you. But why must you say to me,
“Stay in your place.” Do you feel better having someone lower than
you?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Shut up, you’re talking crazy.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me
feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don’t want anything
lower than I am. I’m low enough already. I want to rise. And push
everything up with me as I go …</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Will you be still?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: And if you can’t understand this you’re a
fool – because you can’t win this strike without me! You can’t win
anything without me!</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: That would be the old way. Never try it
on me again – never.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: I am going to bed now. Sleep where you
please – but not with me.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: So they had a little taste of what its like
to be a woman … and they run away.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: With Ram�n it’s … pride. I spoke out of
the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Anything worth learning is a hurt. These
changes come with pain … for other husbands too … not just Ram�n.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: You mean you’re ready to give up?
I don’t want to go down fighting. I want to win. Have you learned
nothing from this strike? I can feel it coming. It’s like a lull before
the storm. And now they can’t win unless they pull off something big and
pull it off fast.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Brothers, we’ve got to go back!</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Esperanza! Where’s Ram�n?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: Ram�n?</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Did he go hunting with the others?</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Where? Where can we find him? Do you
know?</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>sal</strong>: Deer hunters! Deserters, that’s what they
are.</p>
<p><strong>teresa</strong>: Something wrong? Charley, tell us.</p>
<p><strong>charley</strong>: Company’s got an eviction order.</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: Don’t worry. Quintero’s gone hunting with
the others. Evict him first; the rest will be easy. Let their neighbors
watch. Scare some sense into them.</p>
<p><strong>luz</strong>: Can’t we do something?</p>
<p><strong>kimbrough</strong>: All right, girls – get back, get
back.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Never mind them brats! Come on – get the
work done.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: This is what we’ve been waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: This means they’ve given up trying to break
the picket line. Now we can all fight together – all of us.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Now see here, Quintero! These women are
obstructin’ justice. You make ’em behave, savvy?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: I can’t do nothing, sheriff. You know how it
is – they won’t listen to a man any more.</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: You want me to lock ’em up again?</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You want ’em in your lock-up again?</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Form a cordon! Keep ’em away from the
house! Form a cordon!</p>
<p><strong>alfredo</strong>: Hey! The guys from the open pit …</p>
<p><strong>gonzales</strong>: And the guys from the mill.</p>
<p><strong>ad libs</strong>: We stopped them … It took all we had, but
we stopped them … When we heard about it at the mill, we just walked off
… Did you see their faces? .. .</p>
<p><strong>sheriff</strong>: Got any more ideas?</p>
<p><strong>alexander</strong>: I don’t make policy.</p>
<p><strong>hartwell</strong>: I’ll talk to New York. Maybe we better
settle this thing. For the present.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: We did not know then that we had
won the strike. But our hearts were full. And when Ram�n said.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Thanks … sisters… and brothers.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: Esperanza … thank you … for your dignity.</p>
<p><strong>ram�n</strong>: You were right. Together we can push
everything up with us as we go.</p>
<p><strong>esperanza’s voice</strong>: Then I knew we had won something
they could never take away – something I could leave to our children –
and they, the salt of the earth, would inherit it.</p>
