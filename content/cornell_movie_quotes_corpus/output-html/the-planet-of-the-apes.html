<p><strong>shooting script</strong>: May 5, 1967</p>
<p><strong>revised:</strong>: 05/11/67 05/16/67 05/23/67 06/09/67
06/15/67 06/22/67 07/06/67 07/27/67</p>
<p><strong>astronaut’s voice</strong>: So ends my last signal until we
reach our destination. We are now on automatic, a mere hundred and five
light years from our base … and at the mercy of com- puters. I’ve tucked
in my crew for the long sleep. I’ll join them presently.</p>
<p><strong>astronaut</strong>: Within the hour we shall complete the
sixth month of our flight from Cape Kennedy. By our time, that is …</p>
<p><strong>astronaut’s voice</strong>: But according to Dr. Hasslein
theory of time in a vehicle traveling at close to the speed of light,
old Mother Earth has aged a few thousand years since our de- parture –
while we have scarcely aged at all.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It may be so. This much is probable: the men
who sent us on this journey have long since been moldering in forgotten
graves; and those, if any, who read this message are a different breed.
Hopefully, a better one.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I leave the twentieth century without
regret. Who was it? Marshall? … said ‘Modern man is the missin ’a link
between the ape and the human being.’</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: One final thought – nothing scientific,
purely personal. Seen from up here, everything looks different … Time
bends and space is boundless. It squashes a man’s ego. He begins to feel
like no more than a mote in the eye of eternity. And he is nagged by a
question: ahat if any- thing, will greet us on the end of man’s first
journey to a star? Are we to believe that throughout these thousands of
galaxies, these millions of stars, only one, that speck of solar dust we
call Earth, has been graced – or cursed – by human life? I have to doubt
it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That’s about all. I wonder if Man, that
marvel of the universe, that glorious paradox who has sent me to the
unknown… still makes war against his brother., and lets his neighbor’s
children starve.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well then, Earthmen: A missing link salutes
you. Bless you, my descendants.</p>
<p><strong>7- several shots - the four caskets - from taylor’s
p.o.v.</strong>: 10 One of them is open. The other three are occupied by
astronauts: DODGE, LANDON and STEWART. They, too, wear dungarees and
boots. Dodge and Landon are thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile – America’s
finest. Stewart is a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short. Their
eyes are closed and they do not appear to be breathing – yet no
undertaker could make them so alive.</p>
<p>****: Credits will appear here over a series of shots designed to
convey a sense of loneliness, of separation, and of the passage of</p>
<p><strong>12- a series of shots - a distant globe</strong>: 16 We see a
strange and distant planet. At first the globe occupies but a small area
of the screen; but with each new VIEW it comes closer and looms larger,
as if” observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of descent.</p>
<p><strong>taylor’s voice</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Stewart? Stewart?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: There goes our primary power. We’re on
auxilliary.</p>
<p><strong>taylor’s voice</strong>: We’re in the soup. We’re
sinking.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Dodge! Read the atmosphere!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Landon! Send a last signal.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: What signal?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: To Earth! That we’ve landed!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: It’s breathable.</p>
<p><strong>taylor’s voice</strong>: Okay! Blow the hatch before we lose
auxilliary power.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: It’s no use … there she goes.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Forget it. Abandon ship.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Briny…twenty-five percent salinity. Near the
saturation point.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: She’s still sinking…</p>
<p><strong>landon’s voice</strong>: Going … going…</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Gone.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We’re here to stay.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Well? Where are we? Have any notion,
skipper?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We’re some three hundred and twenty light
years from Earth. On an unnamed planet in orbit around a star in the
constellation of Orion. That could be Bellatrix.</p>
<p><strong>dodge’s voice</strong>: Too red for Bellatrix.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: You didn’t have time to check the tapes, so
you don’t really know, do you? What went wrong? We weren’t programmed to
land in water.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: The question, Landon, is not so much where we
are as when we are.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We’ve had a nice snooze. Let’s start earning
all our back pay.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Take your soil test, Dodge. I’ll check the
equipment.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Got your sensors?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yo!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Geiger counter?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Yo!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: One pistol… twenty-four rounds of ammo. two
medical kits.. one camera… one TX9. We’ve enough food and water for
three days.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: But how long is a day?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Good question. Landon – check your
communications kit.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Landon! Join the expedition.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Sorry… I was thinking of Stewart. What d’you
suppose happened?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Air leak. Died in her sleep.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: You don’t seem very cut up about it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s a little late for a wake. She’s been
dead nearly a year.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Then we’ve been away from Earth for eighteen
months.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: By our time. You’ve turned gray.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Apart from that, you look pretty chipper for
a man who’s two thousand and thirty one years old. I read the clocks.
They bear out Hasslein’s hypothesis. We’ve been away from Earth for two
thousand years, give or take a decade. Still can’t accept it, huh?</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: You know it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Because time has wiped out everyone and
everything you cared for – they’re dust.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Prove it. If we can’t get back, it’s still
just a theory.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s a fact, Landon. Buy it. You’ll sleep
better.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Nothing will grow here …. there’s just a
trace of hydrocarbons, and most of the nitrogen is locked into
nitrates.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Any sign of dangerous ionization?</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Okay. If there’s no life here, we’ve got
just seventy-two hours to find it. That’s when the groceries run
out.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Which direction?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That way.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Any particular reason?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: None at all.</p>
<p><strong>45- out</strong>: 58</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Everybody all right?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Water check.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Eight ounces.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: It doesn’t add up. There’s a mantle of dust
around this planet and yet it’s as humid as a jungle. Thunder and
lightning and yet no rain. Cloud cover every night and that strange
luminosity, and yet no moon.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: If only we could get a fix.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What would you learn? I’ve told you where
you are and when you are.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Taylor – quit riding him.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re more than three hundred light years
from your precious planet. Your loved ones have been dead and forgotten
for twenty centuries. Even if you could get back, they’d think you were
something that fell out of a tree.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: All right –</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: There’s only one reality left. We’re here
and it’s now. You get ahold of that and hang on tight, or you might as
well be dead.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: I’m prepared to die.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: He’s prepared to die! Doesn’t that make you
misty? Chalk up another victory for the human spirit!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Straighten me out on something. Why did you
come along at all? You volunteered. Why? I’ll tell you. They nominated
you for the Big One and you couldn’t turn it down. Not without losing
your All-American standing</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Climb off me, will you!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: And the glory, don’t forget that. There’s a
life-sized bronze statue of you somewhere. It’s probably turned green by
now, and nobody can read the name plate. But never let it be said we
forget our heroes.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Taylor. I’m telling you –</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Oh, and one last item. Immortality. You
wanted to go on forever. Well, you damn near made it. Except for Dodge
and me, you’ve lived longer than anybody. And with Stewart dead, it
looks like we’re the last of the strain. You got what you wanted, kid.
How does it taste?</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Okay. You read me well enough. Why can’t I
read you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Don’t bother</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Dodge … he’s not like me at all. But he
makes sense. Held walk naked into a live volcano if he thought he could
learn something no other man knew. I understand why he’s here. But
you…You’re no seeker. You’re negative.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: But I’m not prepared to die.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: I’d like to know why not. You thought life
on Earth was meaningless. You despised people. So what did you do? You
ran away.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No, not quite, Landon. I’m a bit of a seeker
myself. But my dreams are a lot emptier than yours. I can’t get rid of
the idea that somewhere in the Universe there must be a creature
superior to man.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Taylor! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Life.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Where there’s one there’s another. And
another. And another.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Let’s find them all.</p>
<p><strong>a-r series of shots of descent of astronauts down sheer face
of a canyon</strong>: .</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: It’s a stream bed., no doubt about it – but
bone dry.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Look. . .</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Scarecrows?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Let’s take a look.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Never mind the scarecrows.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: It’s loaded with minerals, but safe.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Can we take a dip?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>landon’s voice</strong>: Hey, Taylor! Look at this –</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: My God..they look almost human.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: They – there’s a herd of them.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Show them we’re friendly.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Greetings!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No cigar.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Try telling them our names.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, if we’re looking for an icebreaker…
Listen, folks …..</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: I’m afraid they aren’t having any.</p>
<p><strong>99- out</strong>: 102</p>
<p><strong>103- a series of flash shots - the jungle :</strong>: 105</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: They didn’t leave much did they?</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Shall we follow them?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Haven’t much choice.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Well, at least they haven’t tried to bite
us.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Blessed are the vegetarians.</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: We got off at the wrong stop.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re our optimist Look at the bright side.
If that’s the best there is around here, in six months we’ll be running
this planet.</p>
<p><strong>dodge</strong>: Look…</p>
<p><strong>landon</strong>: Think they’ll attack us?</p>
<p><strong>122- a series of flash shots - the hunt in the
savanna</strong>: 124 As the “horsemen” close in on the creatures
fleeing on foot.</p>
<p><strong>130- a series of shots - the hunters and the
hunted:</strong>: 135 Landon flees from one rider only to be cut off by
another. He stumbles and a rearing stallion tramples him.</p>
<p><strong>139- out</strong>: 140</p>
<p><strong>ape photographer</strong>: Smile.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Which one was wearing the strange clothes?</p>
<p><strong>galen</strong>: Him.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Will he live?</p>
<p><strong>galen</strong>: I don’t know. This beast lost a lot of
blood.</p>
<p><strong>galen</strong>: There’s no probe here. Find one!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: This place is dirty, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>galen</strong>: These animals are dirty, doctor. They stink,
and they carry communicable diseases. Why aren’t they cleaned up before
they’re brought here?</p>
<p><strong>zira’s voice</strong>: You don’t sound happy in your
work.</p>
<p><strong>galen’s voice</strong>: I’m nothing more than a vet in this
laboratory…</p>
<p><strong>galen’s voice</strong>: You promised to speak to Dr. Zaius
about me.</p>
<p><strong>zira’s voice</strong>: I did. But you know how he looks down
his nose at chimpanzees.</p>
<p><strong>galen</strong>: But the quota system’s been abolished! You
made it. Why can’t I?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: What do you mean, made it? I’m an animal
psychologist, that’s all. We don’t have any authority.</p>
<p><strong>galen</strong>: You do pretty well when it comes to getting
space and equipment.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: That’s because Dr. Zaius realizes our work has
value.</p>
<p><strong>galen</strong>: Hmph.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: The foundations of scientific brain surgery
are being laid right here - in studies of cerebral function in these
animals.</p>
<p><strong>galen</strong>: They’re still dirty. And their bite is
septic. Look at that …</p>
<p><strong>galen</strong>: Hold his head.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Hey! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Simmer down! You especially.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Better give it a try, stupid. Unless you
like going hungry.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Good morning, Dr. Zira.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Good morning, Julius. How’s our patient
today?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: No change. The minute you open the door, he
goes into his act.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Well, what do we want this morning? Do we want
something? Speak! Come on, speak!</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Do we want some sugar, old-timer?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: You could get hurt doing that, Doctor.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Don’t be silly. He’s perfectly tame.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: They’re all tame until they take a chunk out
of you.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Well, Bright Eyes, is our throat feeling
better?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Listen, listen – I can speak –</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Awww, it still hurts, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: See? He keeps pretending he can talk.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m not pretending! I can talk!</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Did you see that? It’s remarkable!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: He’s trying to form words.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Well, you know what they say. Human see,
human do.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: He seems to want something.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’d be careful, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: What did I tell you! Try that again, I’ll
break your arm!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What’s the matter with you? I can talk!
Can’t you see that?</p>
<p><strong>julius’ voice</strong>: Good morning, Your Excellency.</p>
<p><strong>152- out</strong>: 160</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Dr. Zaius, I’m so glad you could come. He’s
over here.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Bright Eyes, show him! Go ahead! Do your
trick!</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Speak! Go on. Speak again.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: My - name - isn’t - Bright Eyes It’s
Taylor!</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: There! Can you believe it? I looks like he’s
talking.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Yes, amusing. A man who acts like an ape.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m not acting! I can talk! How much proof
do you want?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Dr. Zaius, I could have sworn he was answering
you!</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: He shows a definite gift for mimicry.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I wonder how held score on a Hopkins manual
dexterity test?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: An animal?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: He’s moving his fingers!</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Of course. He saw you moving yours.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: But perhaps he understood –</p>
<p><strong>zaius’ voice</strong>: Man has no understanding, Dr. Zira. He
can be taught a few simple tricks. Nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>zira’s voice</strong>: I beg to disagree. According to my
exper- iments –</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: A word to the wise, Dr. Zira. Experimental
brain surgery on these creatures is one thing. I’m all for it.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: But your behavioral studies are another
matter entirely. To suggest that we can learn something about simian
nature from a study of man is nonsense. Besides, men are a nuisance.
They outgrow their own food supply in the forest and migrate to our
green belts and ravage our crops. The sooner they’re exterminated, the
better.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: It’s a question of simian survival.</p>
<p><strong>ape guard</strong>: Is this the one you wanted, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>zira’s voice</strong>: Yes, thank you. Bright Eyes?</p>
<p><strong>zira’s voice</strong>: I’ve got a present for you.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Put her in with him.</p>
<p><strong>162- out</strong>: 169</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Do you have to work tonight?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Neither do I.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: That’s Bright Eyes. The one I was telling you
about.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: What’s so special about him?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Watch. Hello, Bright Eyes. How’s our throat
today?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Look – she remembers.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Remembers what?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: The blood transfusion.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Zira, come on. You know they can’t – Oh
oh. Here comes Number One.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Something’s bothering him. He’s been prying
around the lab for the last two days …</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Good morning, Dr. Zaius. You know
Dr. Cornelius, my fiance.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Oh, yes – the young ape with a shovel. I hear
you’re planning another archeological expedition.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius’ voice</strong>: Yes, sir. If the academy
agrees.</p>
<p><strong>zaius’ voice</strong>: The project will require my support,
of course.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius’ voice</strong>: I hope I can count on it, sir.</p>
<p><strong>zaius’ voice</strong>: A friendly warning, Cornelius – when
you’re digging for artifacts, don’t bury your reputation.</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Guards!</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Stop! You’ve hurt him! Take them inside!</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Cornelius, if you have a moment today, I’d
like to discuss this expedition of yours in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Certainly, sir. I’ll get my notes and
come right over.</p>
<p><strong>hunt club leader</strong>: I don’t understand these animal
psychologists. What’s Dr. Zira trying to prove?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: That man can be domesticated.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Those fools and their torches! Do you have any
ointment?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I’m sorry, Bright Eyes.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I told you what you’d get!</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Julius, don’t. It doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Natural born thieves, aren’t they?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Get me a collar and leash. I’m taking him to
the infirmary.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: He’s vicious, Doctor. Besides, it’s against
the rules.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Do as I say.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: You wouldn’t hurt me, would you… Taylor?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: It’s a stunt. Humans don’t write.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Dear, you’re a scientist. Don’t you believe
your own eyes?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Where did you learn to do this?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Jefferson Public School, Fort Wayne,
Indiana?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Back on that planet you say you came
from? Um-hm. He may be intelligent, but he’s also mad.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: ‘And you’re a fool’.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Now, just a minute –</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Oh, Cornelius, be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: ‘Dodge was killed in the hunt. What happened
to Landon?’ I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: And they fell out of the sky with
you?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: ‘Not fell – flew!’</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Flight is a scientific impossibility.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: And even if it weren’t, why fly? Where would
it get you?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Well, now…</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: ‘Do you have maps?’</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: We are here … You were captured about
here.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: You fell in the water here? … you came ashore
… you marched across the desert … the mountains … many days and nights …
and reached the jungle.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Out - of - the - question!.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Cornelius, why do you insist on provoking
him?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: No creature can survive in that part of
the Forbidden Zone. I’ve been there. I’ve seen it.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: ’Then how do you account for me?,</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I don’t. And I’m not going to try.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: But what about your theory? The existence of
someone like Taylor might prove it.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Zira, are you trying to get my head cut
off?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Don’t be foolish. If it’s true, they’ll have
to accept it.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: No, they won’t -</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Cornelius has developed a brilliant hypothesis
-</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: It’s probably wrong –</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: – that the ape evolved from a lower order of
primate, possibly man. In his trip to the Forbidden Zone he discovered
traces of a culture older than recorded time -</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: The evidence was very meager –</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: You didn’t think so then.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: That was before Dr. Zaius and half the
Academy said the idea was heresy.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: How can scientific truth be heresy? What if
Taylor is exactly the proof you needed? A mutation. A missing link
between the unevolved primate and the ape -</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: He’s touchy, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: ‘I am not a missing link.’</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Because if he is a missing link, it means
the Sacred Scrolls aren’t worth their parchment.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Well, maybe they’re not.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: No, thank you’. I won’t get into that
battle.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Oh, Cornelius, show some strength!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Zira, listen to me. We’ve got a fine
future ahead of us. Marriage. Stimulating careers. I’m up for a raise
–</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Dr. Zaius –</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Did you forget our appointment,
Cornelius?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Oh., no., sir. I was just assembling my
notes.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: You know Dr. Maximus, our Commissioner for
Animal Affairs?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Certainly, sir. It’s a pleasure to see
you again.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: A man, Dr. Maximus.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: I know it’s a man. And you know the rules.
No animals outside the compound, and most certainly not without a
leash.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Yes, Sir. But this – creature is a special
case.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Why special?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: We’re – conducting a new experiment.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Wouldn’t it more properly be done in your
office?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Yes, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Guards?</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Return this beast to the compound.</p>
<p><strong>zaius’ voice</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: A toy. It floats on the air. Try it.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Zira….</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>julius’ voice</strong>: What’s up, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>ape lieutenant</strong>: We’re taking Number Four over to
surgery in five minutes. Have him ready.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: How come? The beast’s throat is nearly
healed.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: It’s not his throat this time. The vet’s
going to geld him.</p>
<p><strong>julius’ voice</strong>: Dr. Zira won’t like it. She wants
this pair to mate.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: These orders came from Dr. Zaius
himself. There’s nothing she can do about it.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: If only you knew, Bright Eyes, what they’re
going to do … Stand still now…don’t give me any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Weep if you must, but make an end of
sorrow. He lives again. Yes, he has found peace in Heaven.</p>
<p><strong>minister’s voice</strong>: He was a model for us all, a
gorilla to remember; hunter, warrior, defender of the Faith.</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: Cherished husband, beloved father,
generous master – yes, he was a font of simian kindness.</p>
<p><strong>minister’s voice</strong>: The dear departed once said to me:
‘I never met an ape I didn’t like’…</p>
<p><strong>child</strong>: Look!. It’s a man!</p>
<p><strong>minister</strong>: In Heaven’s name … Get rid of that
creature.</p>
<p><strong>first usher</strong>: There he is:</p>
<p><strong>first chimp</strong>: You see what I saw?</p>
<p><strong>second chimp</strong>: Must’ve escaped from the zoo.</p>
<p><strong>227- several shots - taylor and pursuing mountie</strong>:
231</p>
<p><strong>235- out</strong>: 237</p>
<p><strong>239- another part of the mall - a swift sequence of
shots</strong>: 244</p>
<p><strong>245- ext. open-air market - several shots</strong>: 248</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Dodge …</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Taylor, why’d you run away?</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: Security police.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I’m in charge of this man.</p>
<p><strong>lieutenant</strong>: No longer, madame. He is now in the
custody of the Ministry of Science.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Get away from me, you dirty ape!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: …and that’s when I decided to take up
astronautical engineering., you see. I was halfway through college and
I… It’s an old trick! The silent treatment. Four weeks and three days,
and not a word from anyone. Not Zira.,or Cornelius…or that damn Julius.
No one’ll listen… only you. You…Nova. NO-VAH.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yeah…me Tarzan, you Jane. That’s all right …
I had a puppy once that never barked. He just licked my hand. He’s dead
now. They’re all dead. Everything… I think maybe they’ll kill me, too.
Are they afraid of me? I can’t hurt them… but I threaten them somehow.
Threaten their faith in simian superiority. Yeah … you’re right. They’ll
have to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Let her alone!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Where are you taking her? What are you going
to do?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Take your hands off her, you black monster!
You filth!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Why are you doing this? Say something, you
hairy scum!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Turn it off!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Answer me!</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Shut up! The reason no one’ll talk to you is
because you’re a freak!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Where’s Dr. Zira? Why–?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: I said shut up!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Ape! Apes wearing clothes! It’s a madhouse!
A madhouse!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Now I don’t even have you. Imagine me –
needing someone. Back on Earth there was nobody. Women, yes. Lots of
them. Love making ithout love. That’s the kind of world it was turning
into, with the help of cynics like myself. So I left it – because there
was no one dear enough to keep me there. Did I tell you about Stewart?
There was a lovely girl. The most precious cargo we brought along. If
human life could survive here, she was to be the new Eve. It’s probably
just as well she didn’t live to see this.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I wonder if it’s Love between us. What a
place to find it.</p>
<p><strong>268- out</strong>: 272</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Where have you been? Why didn’t you come to
see me?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Shhhh!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: A hearing.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Be clever. Be quiet,</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: All rise!</p>
<p><strong>bailiff</strong>: Be seated.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: This ad hoc Tribunal of the National
Academy is now in session. President of the Academy presiding. On my
right, Dr. Maximus, Commissioner for Animal Affairs. On my left,
Dr. Zaius, Minister of Science and Chief Defender of the Faith…
Appearing for the State, Dr. Honorius, Deputy Minister of Justice.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Let it be clear at the outset that all
matters pertaining to this inquiry are confidential, and anyone
discussing them outside this chamber will be held in contempt of the
Tribunal. You may proceed, Dr. Honorius.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: By your leave, Mr. President – the Tribunal
has not yet defined the purpose of this inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You asked for the opportunity to present
your case. Surely you must know why you’re here.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: My own purpose is to save this exceptional
creature from mutilation.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: And our purpose is to settle custodial and
jurisdictional questions concerning this beast, and determine what’s to
be done with him.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: At the very least, this man has the right to
know whether there’s a charge against him.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: Objection. The accused is indeed a man.
Therefore, he has no rights under ape law.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Well, Dr. Zira? This is a man, is he
not?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: He is unlike any man you have ever seen - as
we hope to prove.</p>
<p><strong>president’s voice</strong>: Answer the question. Is he a
man?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Sir? The question is the point at issue:
Is he a man? Or a deviate? Or a freak of nature?</p>
<p><strong>honorius’ voice</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Sustained. In all fairness, Dr. Zira, you
must admit the accused is a nonape, and therefore has no rights under
ape law.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Then why is he called the accused Your Honors
must think him guilty of something.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: This man is not being tried. He is being
disposed of. It is scientific heresy that is actually on trial here.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: Well put, Dr. Zaius. Let us warn our
friends that they endanger their own careers by defending this
animal.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Then I’ll defend myself.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Dr. Zira – tell Bright Eyes to sit
down.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: My name is Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: It says here that his name is Bright
Eyes. You gave him that name yourself.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: This hearing is absurd! Let me tell my
story…</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Bailiff! Make the animal be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: State your case, Mr. Prosecutor.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: Learned Judges: My case is simple. It is
based on our first Article of Faith: that the Almighty created the ape
in his own image; that He gave him a soul and a mind; that He set him
apart from the beasts of the jungle, and made him the lord of the
planet.</p>
<p><strong>honorius’ voice</strong>: These sacred truths are
self-evident. The proper study of apes is apes. But certain young cynics
have chosen to study man - yes, perverted scientists who advance on
insidious theory called ‘evolution.’</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: There is a conspiracy afoot to undermine
the very cornerstone of our Faith</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Come to the point, Dr. Honorius.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: Directly, Mr. President. This wretched
man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. We know that he was
wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. The State charges that
Dr. Zira and a corrupt surgeon named Galen experimented on this wounded
animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking
monster …</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: That�s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Mind your tongue, madame.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Did we create his mind too? Not only can this
man speak. He can write. He can reason.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: He can reason? With the Tribunal’s
permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Proceed. But don’t turn this hearing into
a farce.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: Tell the court, Bright Eyes – what is the
second Article of Faith?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I admit, I know nothing of your culture.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: Of course he doesn’t know our culture -
because he cannot think. Tell us why all apes are created equal.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Some apes, it seems, are more equal than
others.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: Ridiculous. That answer is a contradiction
in terms. Tell us, Bright Eyes, why do men have no souls? What is the
proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Show this to the President.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Since the defendant is forbidden to speak in
his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the
record.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Read it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: ’I have come to you from a planet in a
different solar system. I am an explorer in space, with no hostile
intentions against your civilization. On my planet it was the primate
Man who evolved Into a thinking animal, while the apes remained…”</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Stop right there. Bring me that
paper.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: This is a joke in very poor taste.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Is it a joke to seek the truth about this
man?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Dr. Zira – you state here that a ship from
outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I do not state it, sir. The prisoner does.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Do you believe him?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Like you, I find it difficult.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: But how convenient that the proof of his
arrival has vanished? You also state that Bright Eyes had two
intelligent companions at the time of his capture.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: This is his assertion.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Where are they now?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: One is in a museum!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Dr. Zira! Silence that man!</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: How sad. Stuffed and mounted, eh? Dead men,
like sunken ships, can tell no stories. And his other companion?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: He doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Mr. President, I believe the Prosecutor has
reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with
Bright Eyes.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: That’s true, Dr. Zaius. My witnesses –
correction – my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Very well. I suggest we go and look at
them.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s him…Landon.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Second from the left.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Well…do you acknowledge kinship with any of
these creatures?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: With one of them.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Identify him, then. Speak to him.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Landon?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: John … it’s me, Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You! … You knew about this?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: No, I swear – I never saw this man before.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You did this to him! You’ve removed his
frontal lobes!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Silence! Bailiff, take the prisoner
inside!</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Mr. President, a word of explanation: the
creature in question suffered a skull fracture during the hunt. Two fine
veternary surgeons under my direction were able to save his life. But
the beast could not speak, of course. Nor will he ever speak</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You destroyed his memory! His mind! His
identity! And, you want to do the same to me!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Bailiff! Stop this outburst! Gag that
monstrosity!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You barbarians!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: May it please the Tribunal: I for one
grant that this being cannot have come from another planet. But this
much is certain – he comes from somewhere in the Forbidden Zone. He has
described the region to us, and described it accurately, for I have been
there.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: You visited the Forbidden Zone?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Why, yes, sir. A year ago. With the
special permission of the Academy.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: He exceeded his orders. His travel permit was
promptly revoked.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Yes, sir, so it was – thanks to you. But
not before I discovered evidence of a simian culture that existed long
before the Sacred Scrolls were written …</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: Objection! These remarks are profane and
irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Sustained. Your archeological theories
have no bearing on the disposition of this creature.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Let them talk, Mr President. Let them
talk.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Sirs: our theories have a bearing on his
identity.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Let us assume, as common sense dictates, that
the prisoner’s story is false. But if he does not come from another
planet, then surely he sprang from our own. Yes, sprang. As an animal
psychologist, I have found no physiological defect to explain why humans
are mute.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Their speech organs are adequate. The flaw
lies not in anatomy but in the brain.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: Objection!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Sustained.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Sustain all objections, but face the
truth!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Yes! Behold this marvel, this living
paradox, this missing link in an evolutionary chain!</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Silence! You have gone too far.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: There you are, Mr. President. I warned you
these two would use this hearing as a forum for subversion.</p>
<p><strong>maximus</strong>: You were right! The advocates of heresy
have revealed themselves.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Mr. President, I think an indictment is in
order.</p>
<p><strong>honorius</strong>: Yes, sir. The State charges Doctors Zira
and Cornelius with contempt of this Tribunal, malicious mischief and
scientific heresy.</p>
<p><strong>president</strong>: Be it so ordered. The Tribunal will
examine all the evidence presented here and in due time render a verdict
on the proposed indictment and on the disposition of the deviate in
question. This hearing is adjourned.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Wait outside.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: The verdict is in. At the moment your simian
friends – and sponsors – are free on bail. But they’ll soon be brought
to trial for heresy.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What about me?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Oh, your case was preordained. In a way, you
performed a service for the State … Because your hearing made it
possible for us to expose Zira and Cornelius. And now the Tribunal has
placed you in my custody for…final disposition. Do you know what that
means?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Emasculation, to begin with. Then
experimental surgery. On the speech centers. On the brain. Ultimately, a
kind of living death.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: However, it’s within my power to grant You a
reprieve. That is why I summoned you here tonight. Tell me who and what
you really are and where you come from, and no veterinary will touch
you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I told the truth at that ’hearing’of
yours.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: You lied. Where is your tribe?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: My tribe, as you call it, lives on another
planet in a distant solar system.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Then how is it we speak the same language?
Even in your lies, some truth slips through! That mythical community
you’re supposed to come from – Fort Wayne’?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: A fort! Unconsciously, you chose a name that
was belligerent. Where were you nurtured?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I take it you don’t believe the prosecutor’s
charge – that I’m a monster created by Dr. Zira.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Certainly not. You’re a mutant.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That’s exactly what Zira and Cornelius
claim. You’re talking heresy, doctor.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: All right, suppose I am a mutant? Why does
the appearance of one mutant send you into a panic?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Because you’re not unique. There was the one
you call Landon –</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Then you admit –</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: I admit that where there’s one mutant there’s
probably another. And another. A nest of them. Where’s your nest,
Taylor? Where are your women?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Thank you for calling me Taylor. Dr. Zaius,
I know who I am. Who are you? How did this upside down civilization ever
get started?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: You may well call it upside down, since you
occupy its lowest level. And deservedly. The eastern desert has never
been explored – because we’ve always assumed that no life can exist
there. Save yourself, Taylor. Tell me – is there another jungle beyond
the Forbidden Zone?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: If you are protecting others of your kind, it
will cost you your identity.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m not protecting anybody! That hearing was
a farce. What have I done?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: You’re a menace! A walking pestilence. I do
know who you are, Taylor. As I know that others of your kind must live
in the Forbidden Zone. You have just six hours to make a full
confession. After that I’ll employ surgery to obtain one. Guards!</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Take this creature back to his cage.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: All right, you can cut me to pieces. It’s
within your power. But know this, doctor. You do it because you’re
afraid of me. You do it from fear!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Are you Julius?</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I’m from the Office of Animal Affairs. This
male’s to be transferred to the zoo.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: At this hour? Who says so?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Don’t they tell you anything? The Anti-
vivisectionist Society is up in arms. They’re going to save this beast
from those butchers in the lab. If he can speak he belongs in the public
zoo. But what’ll probably happen is that some money-mad grown-up will
put him in a circus. And then we’ll have to pay to see what rightfully
should have –</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: Stop making speeches and show me the
order.</p>
<p><strong>julius</strong>: This order’s no good. It must be counter-
signed by Dr. Zaius –</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Hit him!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: So you can talk. I’m Dr. Zira’s nephew. This
abduction was her idea. You’re not really going to the zoo. That’s just
our cover story in case we’re stopped. Although I do feel that if it
ever came down to a question of whether something like you should be
public or private property –</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Come on. Get me out of here.</p>
<p><strong>lucius’ voice</strong>: We’ve got to move fast.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: She comes along too.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Zira doesn’t want your female.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I want her.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: If you insist. But I’m not taking any orders
–</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Fine. Just let her out.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: I told you not to bring the other one.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: He wouldn’t leave her.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: All right… Get in…hurry. Put this on.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Listen-</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Taylor – just keep quiet and we may get away
with this. Remember that men all look alike to most apes.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Gorilla hunters …</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Keep moving. We can’t turn back now.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Hold it!</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: Ah, Doctor Zira! Our wagon broke down! I’m
afraid we’ll have to commandeer yours.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: You can’t! I’ve two sick humans in the cage.
We’re taking them to the chief vet at the zoo …</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: We bagged two live ones today. I’ll have to
ask you to take them along.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: No, no, my animals are diseased… Leave them
alone! They’re diseased, I tell you!</p>
<p><strong>first hunter</strong>: Give him a taste of fire!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Stand back! He’s dangerous!</p>
<p><strong>first hunter</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: He’s rabid! His bite is fatal!</p>
<p><strong>first hunter</strong>: You serious?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: You would die in agony! Frothing at the
mouth!</p>
<p><strong>first hunter</strong>: They treat those animals better than
they treat us.</p>
<p><strong>leader</strong>: I still say the only good human is a dead
human.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: How did it go?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: There was one bad moment – some hunters
stopped us.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I pursuaded them our beasts had rabies.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Let me out of here!</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Well, Taylor – we’re all fugitives
now.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Do you have any weapons?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: The best. But we won’t need them.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Just the same, I want one.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Look here, Taylor. I’m in charge of this
expedition –</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Fair enough. But you’re no longer in charge
of me. And I don’t mean to be captured again.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: As you wish.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Zaius seems to think there might be another
jungle beyond the Forbidden Zone. That’s what we’ll try for. What about
you?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Cornelius and I have been indicted for heresy.
Unless we can prove our theories, we don’t stand a chance of
acquittal.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’re going back to the Forbidden Zone?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: To the diggings I worked at a year ago.
It’s a three day ride across the eastern desert, near where you claim
you landed from that planet of yours.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You still don’t believe me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: It’s a long detour to Dead Lake. What
would we find?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Nothing much. The remnants of a life raft.
Maybe a small flag. The emblem of my countrymen.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Sorry, Taylor. The terrain around that
lake is poisonous. There is no fresh water, no vegetation. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I know … Nevertheless, I thank you for
saving us. You’ll be in trouble for going there.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: We’ve been in trouble since the moment we met
you.</p>
<p><strong>zira’s voice</strong>: What’s she pointing at?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That’s the way home. And she knows it.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Nova! We can’t stay there. It’s not
safe.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: We’d better get started. If the mounted police
pick up our trail, they’ll come this far at least.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Right. Let’s put the water and provisions
in the wagon.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Are you going to take her with you?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Actually, you’re a different breed. This
creature will never evolve.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Maybe not.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: You want her that much?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You threw us together, remember? And you
guessed right. Men, like apes, get despondent without a mate.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Who put them up?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: The Hunt Club.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: To scare off humans?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: To scare us, too. We’re entering the
Forbidden Zone.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Don’t worry. You’ll be safe with me. Here.
It’s time you learned to earn your keep.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You can do it. Like this …</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Something’s wrong with your mate.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Let me handle this. You may be smarter than I
am, but I’m the veterinary on this planet.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Where does the river lead?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: It empties into a sea some miles from
here. That’s where the cave is.</p>
<p><strong>taylor’s voice</strong>: And beyond that?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Don’t know. At high tide you can’t ride
along the shore, and we had no boats on the last expedition.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You’ve never told me why this region’s
called the Forbidden Zone.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: No one really knows. It’s an ancient
taboo. Set forth in the Sacred Scrolls. The Lawgiver pronounced the area
deadly.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Shouldn’t we be moving on?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’m for that.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What’s the diagnosis, doctor? A touch of the
sun?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: She’s not sick at all. She’s pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: So I’m not an altogether different breed,
you see?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Why did you do that? Scrape off your
hair?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: In my world – before I left it - only
youngsters of your age wore un- scraped hair.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: It makes you look somehow … less
intelligent.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: When are you going to show me what’s in the
cave?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Right now, if you like.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Lucius – don’t fire at them.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: You’re all under arrest! You seditious
scoundrel. Drop that rifle.</p>
<p><strong>327- out</strong>: 348</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Stop right there.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Don’t be a fool. You’re outnumbered and
outgunned.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: If there’s any shooting, Dr. Zaius, you’ll
be the first to die. Depend on it.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Taylor, you’re not in command here. Put
down that gun.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Shut up.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Very well. Lower your weapons.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Tell them to move around the point. Out of
range.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: How did you know we’d come here?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: It wasn’t difficult. Only an apostate or a
lunatic would flee to the Forbidden Zone. I see you brought along the
female of your species. I didn’t realize a man could be monogamous.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: On this planet – it’s easy.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: I ask you to reconsider the rash course
you’ve taken. If you’re convicted of heresy, the most you’ll get is two
years. But if you persist in pointing guns in my direction, you’ll hang
for high treason.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: We’ve never meant to be treasonable, sir.
But up there, in the face of that Cliff, is a vast cave – and in that
cave a fabulous treasure of fossils and artifacts.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: I’ve seen some of your fossils and artifacts.
They’re worthless.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: And that’s your Minister of Science. Honor-
bound to expand the frontiers of knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Taylor, please –</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Except that he’s also the Chief Defender of
the Faith.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: There is no contradiction between faith and
science. True science.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: All right, let’s see if you’re willing to
put that statement to a test.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Taylor, I’d rather you -</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No. You saved me from this fanatic. Maybe I
can pay you back.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: What is your proposal?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: When were the Sacred Scrolls written?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Twelve hundred years ago.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Very well. If Zira and Cornelius can prove
that those scrolls don’t tell the whole truth of your history; if they
can show you definite evidence of another culture from an unrecorded
past – will you exonerate them?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Okay.Up to the cave.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Sorry, Lucius. You’ll have to stay here and
guard the horses.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Always giving orders. Just like every other
adult.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Relax. You’ll see it all later.</p>
<p>****: The effect should be an eyeful. I wish to create an illusion of
sunlight penetrating this cave, flooding it with direct,</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Present your evidence, Cornelius.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: It was at this level I discovered traces
of an early ape creature – stage of primitive barbarism, really – dating
back roughly thirteen hundred years. It was here I found cutting tools
and arrowheads of quartz and the fossilized bones of carnivorous
gorillas.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: But the artifacts lying at your feet were
found here, at this level. And that’s the paradox. The more ancient
culture is the more advanced. Admittedly, many of these objects are
unidentified, but clearly they were fashioned by beings with a knowledge
of metallurgy.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Indeed, the very fact that these tools
are unknown to us could suggest a culture in certain ways almost equal
to our own. Some of the evidence is uncontestable …</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Don’t speak to me in absolutes. The evidence
is contestable.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: I apologize.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: To begin with, your methods of dating the
past are crude, to say the least. There are geologists on my staff who
would laugh at your speculations.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Perhaps that’s why they’re on your
staff.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Secondly, if these ‘tools’ as you call them,
are unidentified, why are they introduced as ‘evidence’ of anything?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: But there’s the doll, sir.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Right there. The human doll.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: What does this prove? My grand- daughter
plays with human dolls.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Taylor! Tell him.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: He has a point. On my planet children often
play with ape dolls.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: A doll alone proves nothing. True. But
the doll was found beside the jawbone of a man – and no trace of simian
fossils has turned up in this deposit.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Your conclusion is premature. Have you
forgotten your Scripture? The Thirteenth Scroll? ‘And Proteus brought
the upright beast into the garden, and chained him to a tree, and the
children made sport of him.’</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: No sir, I haven’t forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Well? For a time the ancients kept humans as
household pets. Until the Lawgiver proved that man could not be tamed.
Keep digging Cornelius. You’ll find evidence of the master of this
house: an ape.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Are you going to let that pass without an
answer?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yes. I have to agree. From all you’ve found
so far, his position’s as good as yours.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: What are you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Reconstructing a life. Care to have a
look?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: These were found near the human doll, right?
Well, whoever owned them was in pretty bad shape.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Defective eyesight..</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: He wore false teeth. He suffered from a
hernia and used this truss to hold up his insides … And toward the end,
these little rings of stainless steel enclosed a prefab- ricated valve
in his failing heart.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I don’t say he was a man like an Earthman,
but I’d call him a close relative, for he was plagued by most of man’s
ills. Yet, fragile as he was, he came before you – and was superior to
you.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: That’s lunacy. I can give an alternate
description for everyone of those objects that’s equally as inventive as
yours. But it would be conjecture, not proof.</p>
<p><strong>doll’s head</strong>: Mamma! Mamma! Mamma!.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Dr. Zaius! Would an ape make a human doll
that talks?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Lucius….</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: You louse!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Tell him to pull back!</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Cease fire! Withdraw!</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I ought to kill you right now. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: They took me by surprise. Sneaked up on me
while I was watering the horses. What’s happened to honor? I got off one
round to warn you.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: They’ve taken everything.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Not everything. They left a hostage. How do
you feel, Lucius?</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Disillusioned… But vindicated! I’ve been
right all along. You can’t trust the older generation. It’s a matter of
values –</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: All right, all right. Will You do me a
favor? No orders.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I want you to go around the bend and tell
those gorillas their leader is my prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Yes, I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>tayl0r</strong>: Good. Say I want a week’s supply of food for
the woman and myself. A horse. A spade. And fifty rounds of
ammunition.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: What if they won’t agree to your terms?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Then tell them Dr. Zaius won’t leave here
alive.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Taylor, you can’t.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Oh yes he can. He’s a born killer. Deliver
the message.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Sit down. Over there.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Now, Minister of Science - let me explain
certain principle stress and strain. If you exert pressure to remove
these bonds, you’ll choke yourself to death. It’ll be suicide, you
see?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Taylor, please – don’t treat him that way.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: It’s humiliating.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Wasn’t I humiliated? By all of you? Didn’t
you lead me around on a leash?</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: That was different. We thought you were
…. inferior.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: And now you know the truth. Cornelius has
beaten you, Doctor. He proved it. Man preceded you here. You owe him
your science, your language, whatever knowledge you have.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Then answer this: If ran was superior, why
didn’t he survive?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: He might have been wiped out by a plague.
Natural catastrophe. Like a fiery storm of meteors. From the looks of
this part of your planet, I’d say that was a fair bet.</p>
<p><strong>zira,</strong>: But we can’t be sure.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: He is. He knew all the time. Long before
your discovery, he knew. Defender of the Faith. Guardian of the terrible
secret. Isn’t that right, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: What I know of man was written long ago – set
down by the wisest ape of all – our Lawgiver. Open my breast pocket.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Read it to him: the twentythird Scroll, ninth
Verse.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: ‘Beware the beast man, for he is the
devil’s pawn. Alone among God’s primates, he kills for sport, or lust or
greed. Yes, he will murder his brother to possess his brother’s land.
Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his
home and yours. Shun him. Drive him back into his jungle lair: For he is
the harbinger of death’.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: I found nothing in the cave to alter that
conception of man. And I still live by its injunction.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Stay where you are!</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: They think you’re behaving foolishly. I must
say I agree. Where will you go?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: I’ll start by following the shoreline. And
my nose.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland.
How will you survive?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: He won’t survive. Do you know what sort of
life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren’t
eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour
you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Then there is another jungle?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Of course, you could return with us. Our
society might find a place for you and your mate.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Sure. In a cage.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Where else, but in a cage, does man
belong?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: No, thanks. I’ll take freedom.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Would you like to come along?</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: We can’t.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: It’s better than going to prison for
heresy.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: They can’t convict us of that. You proved
our innocence. Besides… … his culture is our culture.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Good luck then.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Dr. Zira, I’d like to kiss you good-bye.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: All right, but…. …you’re so damned ugly!</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: Go with God, Taylor. That’s an old expression.
it comes from both ape and man.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: God bless you.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Lucius.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: I think you’re making a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: That’s the boy. Keep ’em flying.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: The flags of discontent. It’s the only way
anything ever gets changed. Don’t try to follow us. I’m pretty handy
with things like this.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Of that I’m sure. All my life I’ve awaited
your coming and dreaded it. Like death itself.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Why? From the first, I’ve terrified you,
Doctor. And in spite of every sign that I’m an intelligent being who
means no harm, you continue to hate and fear me. Why?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Because you are a man. And you were right – I
have always known about man. From the evidence, I believe his wisdom
must walk hand in hand with his idiocy. His emotions must rule his
brain. He must be a warlike animal who gives battle to everything around
him – even himself.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: What evidence? No weapons were found in the
cave.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: The Forbidden Zone was once a paradise. Your
breed made a desert of it, ages ago.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: We’re back at the beginning. I still don’t
know the why. A planet where apes evolved from men. A world turned wrong
side up. A puzzle with one piece missing.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Don’t look for it, Taylor. You may not like
what you find.</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Untie me!</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: No, no! Let him go!</p>
<p><strong>390- out</strong>: 405</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: Fetch your explosives. We’re going to seal
the cave.</p>
<p><strong>marcus</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: Seal the cave?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: That’s correct. And you will both stand trial
for heresy.</p>
<p><strong>zira</strong>: But the proof? The doll?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: In a few minutes there will be no doll. There
can’t be. I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cornelius</strong>: You mustn’t! You gave your ’word!</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: What I do, I do with no pleasure. Silence
him.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: Dr. Zaius, this is inexcusable! Why must
knowledge stand still? What about the future?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: I may just have saved it for you.</p>
<p><strong>lucius</strong>: What will he find out there, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>zaius</strong>: His destiny.</p>
<p><strong>407- out</strong>: 408</p>
<p><strong>a note on production</strong>: If feasible at new location
site, this scene should be shot at high tide, so that the water laps at
the base of the cliffs, making a passage difficult and risky.</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: Yes, Nova – I see it. In my old profession
green meant safe. Green meant go.</p>
<p><strong>417- out</strong>: 418</p>
<p><strong>taylor</strong>: My God!</p>
<p><strong>424- out</strong>: 451</p>
