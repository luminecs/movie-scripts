<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: Before the NBA was the NBA, there was
another basketball league in America…</p>
<p><strong>documentary footage</strong>: This is real ABA footage. A
series of great plays are made by ABA stars.</p>
<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: .From 1967 to 1976, there was the
American Basketball Association. A maverick minor-league that would
change the game forever. The ABA made the fast break FAST… Invented the
three point shot… And introduced the world to something called the Slam
Dunk Contest.</p>
<p><strong>documentary footage</strong>: Dr. J launches from the foul
line and dunks in the world’s first dunk contest. David Thompson
finishes an Alley Oop.</p>
<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: Singer Pat Boone owned the Oakland Oaks.
Wilt Chambelain coached the Conquistadors. I myself was the young voice
of the St. Louis Spirits.</p>
<p><strong>documentary footage</strong>: A young Bob Costas broadcasts
from St. Louis, looking pretty sweet in side burns and a tweed
jacket.</p>
<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: Players like Dr. J, Ice-man George
Gervin and Moses Malone were as entertaining as they come. But despite
the league’s flair, convincing fans to show up for games was often a
struggle.</p>
<p><strong>documentary footage</strong>: The infamous TV interview where
Freddy Lewis wins a ‘race horse.’ Footage of ‘Dime Beer Night.’ Footage
of the Kentucky Colonials fielding a cheerleader as one of their
starting five.</p>
<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: For owners, promotional ideas became an
art form all to themselves.</p>
<p><strong>documentary footage</strong>: The Miami Ball Girls dance in
bikinis .</p>
<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: One night, the Nets went as far as to
give a free gerbil to it’s first fifty fans… There were plenty of
punches too, giving the National Hockey League a run for it’s money.</p>
<p><strong>documentary footage</strong>: A guy elbows Connie Hawkins,
who turns and punches the guy in the face.</p>
<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: Yes, the ABA had a style all it’s own.
The hair was big, the shorts were short and the ball was red, white and
blue.</p>
<p><strong>documentary footage</strong>: Harry ‘The fat Mexican guy’
dances.</p>
<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: In 1976, rumors of a merger spread
throughout the league. In the end, only four teams would join the NBA
and survive.</p>
<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: Teams like the Kentucky Colonels and the
Virginia Squires would disappear forever. But their spirit still lives
on to this day.</p>
<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: Here, we present the legend of the ABA…
Exactly as it happened. Some FUNKY MUSIC plays.</p>
<p><strong>bob costas</strong>: Except, this Flint Michigan team never
existed.</p>
<p>****: And, well, everything in this movie is completely fake.</p>
<p><strong>title card: anaheim amigo stadium, 1976.</strong>: CLOSE ON:
A logo of a basketball with a sombrero on it.</p>
<p><strong>“let’s go amigos!”</strong>: Welcome to the American
Basketball Association. A fan chugs his beer and throws some guacamole.
The crowd screams and curses at MONIX, mid 40’S – talented, but past his
prime. this movie. This is the old rock. Think Nolte in 48 hours. .</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: The Amigos are up by one here.
They’ll need to find a way to stop Monix. He checks the clock, waits…
And now drives the lane… MONIX suddenly takes a HUGE HIT, TOTALLY
SLAMMED by a big asshole, PETRELLI. He flies into the crowd – everyone
erupts, screaming with glee.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Ooh, Monix gets taken out hard. Some
tough love from Patrelli.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: WHAT!? Where’s the foul on that? That
was all ball. Jesus Christ Leonard! Let them play for once! This ain’t
fuckin’ Greenpeace!</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Some might say that was a close
call, but these referees have done a nice job tonight.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: ’Oh please. These refs SUCK. Still
stuck in the crowd. Monix struggles to get back on the court. The crowd
shoves him around, twisting his ankle, slapping him. The crowd is
nuts.</p>
<p><strong>drunk lady</strong>: Hey Monix, want a sip? Monix is
confused, until the woman throws the beer in his face.</p>
<p><strong>drunk lady</strong>: Oops. She and her friends laugh. Monix
says nothing. Instead, he holds his aching back and limps up to the foul
line, annoyed.</p>
<p>****: Sorry, Monix, I got pushed.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Well, it looks like the Amigos are
in trouble here. Monix is a ninety percent shooter, if he can hit both
of these free throws, it’s over. Monix performs his ancient free throw
ritual: Three dribbles and a quick spin of the ball. But he MISSES.</p>
<p><strong>suck, man! you suck donkey dick.</strong>: Again, Monix
ignores the drunk lady.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: They dodged a bullet there. But
Monix still has one last chance to tie it up. Monix focuses on his
ritual again.</p>
<p><strong>ball you pussy!</strong>: Monix aims at the basket, about to
shoot, but then suddenly</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: And the second free throw sails
wide.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: Yes! He just pegged a chick! That’s the
greatest thing I’ve ever seen. The lady runs on court and attacks Monix,
her boyfriend jumps in – Monix hits her boyfriend with some quick hockey
punches. The benches clear, everyone is punching everybody.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: And we’ve got a little bit of
pushing and shoving under the basket. What do you make of this, Lou?</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: I’m goin’ in. Lou Redwood takes his
headphones off, climbs over the announcer’s table and jumps into the
fight.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Alright then.</p>
<p>****: More on this Amigo victory, right after this message from Colt
45.</p>
<p><strong>schnack</strong>: Want one? SCHNACK, the owner, carries a six
pack of Schlitz.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I’ll take two. Schnack hands them over. Monix
might speak, but he drinks instead.</p>
<p><strong>schnack</strong>: So, Monix. The trade went through.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Really?</p>
<p>****: For who?</p>
<p><strong>schnack</strong>: You know, you’re not exactly a spring
chicken anymore…</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Just tell me.</p>
<p><strong>schnack</strong>: That score board.</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: Pieces of an old scoreboard are crammed
into the back of the locker room.</p>
<p><strong>schnack</strong>: It’s a Magnovox.</p>
<p>****: Tell me: What the Hell did you want to get traded back to Flint
for, of all places? Please tell me this isn’t about Lynn.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You still owe me $400.</p>
<p><strong>ecu: an old tv. a commercial plays:</strong>: Super-cool
CLARENCE WITHERS, 20’s African-American, walks around a pet store. This
guy is all flash. He spins a ball on his finger, but he’s more Bootsy
Collins than Dr. J.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Don’t get all lonely on me people, get
yourself a dog or a cat or some- - Or a couple of these, from PET
GALAXY. When I’m not dribbling between my legs or sinking jump shots,
I’m buying animals. And if this isn’t thebeststore in Flint Michigan I
will shave this off.Nojoke. Make a fast break overtoPET GALAXY. And be
sure to tell’emSugar Dunkerton sent you.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: Clarence. The guy from the TV is also a
waiter in this restaurant. He’s taking an order from some customers.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: Hey, wasn’t that you just now, there on
the TV?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Yeah, so?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: What are you waiting on us for, if you’re
a basketball star?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Who the Hell areyou,the barbecue police?
Tell youwhat,I’ve got the note pad, so I’llaskthe questions: Do youwanta
baked potato with that?</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: The TV said your name was Sugar Dunkerton.
How come your name-tag doesn’t say that?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: ’Cause I changed my name, that’s why.</p>
<p><strong>customer woman</strong>: Downtown Funky-Stuff Malone?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You like it?</p>
<p><strong>customer woman</strong>: I guess it’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: It ain’t fine. It’s fine…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Shit. It’s been a pleasure serving you.
Clarence tosses his note pad on the table and his Mother tosses him his
duffle bag.</p>
<p><strong>ms. quincy</strong>: And don’t think I didn’t see those
cotton briefs of yours in there.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Stay outta my stuff!</p>
<p><strong>ms. quincy</strong>: Don’t you know our ancestors had to pick
that cotton? Get yourself some silk underpants. Have some respect.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Panties are silk. Briefs are cotton. I’m
out of here.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Ladies and gentleman, please rise…</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: .For the National Anthem… Of your Flint
Michigan Tropics.</p>
<p><strong>we pan some still photos of jackie moon in the
lobby.</strong>: PICTURE 1: The one-hit-wonder, Jackie moon is on an
album cover, shirtless, petting a white leopard.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Baby, who wants to; love me sexy. baby,
are you ready to; lick me sexy.</p>

Baby, we’re naked and we’re; humping sexy–</p>
<p><strong>picture 4</strong>: Jackie hands over a giant check,
PURCHASING THE</p>
<p>****: Oh yeah, Baby, who wants to; love me sexy. baby, are you ready
to; lick me sexy. Jackie Moon is a sight to see. His one-hit-wonder is
ridiculous. But you have to admit it’s catchy.</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts: the retarded world of the flint
tropics:</strong>: THE CROWD: Under 100 people are in the stands, but
they’re high energy. Lots of drinking and dancing.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Take off your shoes and; suck me
sexy.</p>
<p><strong>the ball girls</strong>: They bounce around in shiny-funky
hot pants – dancing cool, but not in sync. When it comes to ball girls,
Flint delivers.</p>
<p><strong>the tropical aisle</strong>: A rowdy bunch is decked out in
Hawaiian shirts and packed in behind the visiter’s bench, looking for
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>the scoreboard</strong>: The Magnovox has been sold. The
Tropics now do it by hand.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Baby, we’re naked and we’re; humping
sexy…</p>
<p><strong>angle on darren and jody</strong>: Two kids in WHEEL CHAIRS
are parked next to the hardwood, eating nachos and drinking giant
cokes.</p>
<p><strong>opposing player</strong>: Hey there son, what’s your
name?</p>
<p><strong>wheelchair darren</strong>: Fuck you, Mitchstien.</p>
<p><strong>wheelchair jody</strong>: Yeah. Throw any elbows tonight and
we’ll pound your fuckin’ head into the floor.</p>
<p><strong>music cue: ‘too hot to handle’ by heatwave.</strong>: With
that, the lights go out, PITCH BLACK. A spot light drops on Jackie
Moon.</p>
<p><strong>luscious, flint tropics action?</strong>: The crowd cheers,
but not all that loud. Jackie looks off screen and nods off screen.
BOBBY DEE works some sound effects, dialing up a knob that says CROWD
NOISE. The speakers are blown, but they’re loud.</p>
<p>****: At ball girl, measuring thirty four, twenty two, thirty six,
MELIN-</p>
<p><strong>daaaaaaa.</strong>: MELINDA shakes her perfect measurements
in the spotlight, then does a series of cartwheels.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I’m living a dream, Flint and I know
you are too. AT GUARD, from Peoria Illinois, six foot one – this guy’s
single and he can cook lasagna, I’ve seen him do it – TWIGGY –
MUNSONNNNNNN! Bobby Dee hits the disco ball as TWIGGY trots out.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: FROM SOUTH BEND INDIANA, the man with a
heart of gold, his brother’s a retard, six foot one, he drives down to
visit all the time, at forward, he reads to him, BEE BEE</p>
<p><strong>ellisssssss!</strong>: BEE BEE ELLIS does a cartwheel into a
round off.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: YOUR MAN IN THE MIDDLE. Seven foot two,
from the People’s Republic of Uzbechistan, he’s tall, he’s sensitive –
loves candle light and long walks on the beach – VAKIDIS</p>
<p><strong>roscovenskiiiiiiii!</strong>: Vakidis, that’s you man, I
called your name. VAKIDIS! C’mon dude, let’s go, get it together.
Players push the giant Vakidis out onto the court.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Now this next guy, where do I start?
First of all, that wife of his, she is… Wow. CANONS, people. If you know
what I’m saying. I don’t think she’s here tonight, but if she was you’d
see what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>dayyyyyyy!</strong>: Scootsie Double Day ‘pops n’ locks’ his
way onto the court.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: AND FINALLY: The man you’ve been
waiting for, six foot four, a solid, meaty, two hundred fifteen pounds,
your pre-game announcer, your owner, your coach, your pop singing
sensation, but most importantly, your POWER FORWARD… Yours truly… JACKIE
M00000000N!!! Jackie takes off his blazer, twirls it, then tosses it off
screen. It’s game time. At center court, PLAYER/OWNER/COACH JACKIE
huddles them up.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Alright you guys, let’s huddle up!
Vakidis! Where’s he walking to? Kong, get Vakidis. A very short Asian
man, KONG, nods. The uniform hangs on his tiny body.</p>
<p><strong>kong</strong>: You got it boss.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Let’s put on a good show tonight, okay?
Let’s keep it in the air, keep shooting, look for the baseball pass,
launch some early threes to set the tone. Bee Bee, try and do that
no-look behind your back thing, I love that, okay? Now let’s bring it
in. One two three–</p>
<p><strong>let’s get tropical!</strong>: REVEAL: An orange cone sits
over a puddle on the court. As the Tropics break the huddle, Jackie
talks to the overweight FATHER PAT THE REF.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Hey, you lose weight, Father Pat?</p>
<p><strong>father pat the ref</strong>: Oh, fuck off. What’s with the
cone tonight Jackie? Jackie points up to a leak in the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: For safety. Just then, Vakidis jogs
over, SLIPPING HORRIBLY in the puddle, ripping his groin.</p>
<p><strong>bobby dee</strong>: Okay Tropics fans, it’s time to guess
today’s attendance… Is it 91</p>
<p><strong>tip off</strong>: The Tropics gain possession.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Scootsie drops it in low to player-
owner-coach Jackie Moon. Known best for his aggressive defense, leads
the team in rebounds. He’s an animal under the boards Lou.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: You’re Damn right. He may not be black,
but he can play basketball.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Now, look at this, Jackie waves the
rest of his team away, looking for the isolation. These fans are in for
a real treat.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: He looks to be setting up his ‘Tear
Drop from Hades.’</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Jackie is shooting thirty-nine
percent from the field, but the crowd always loves to see him go for
it.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: He’s a true showman.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Airball.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: Yep, a Polish swish.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Scootsie Double-Day gets the
offensive rebound and Jackie calls for it again, trying to establish the
low post early. Jackie holds the ball, preparing for another ‘Tear Drop
from Hades’… But now he suddenly gets distracted by something up in the
stands.</p>
<p><strong>doing, man?</strong>: IN THE STANDS: A Pakistani vendor,
RAVI, IS POURING CHEESE ON</p>
<p><strong>ravi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Enough with the cheese already. More
chips, less cheese, how many times do I have to tell you? WHISTLE!
Jackie’s been walking with the ball. FATHER PAT THE REF wears a holy
collar with pin strips over it.</p>
<p><strong>father pat the. ref</strong>: Traveling.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Traveling!?… On who?</p>
<p><strong>father pat the ref</strong>: On you.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: That’s bullshit, Father Pat! Jackie,
furious, SLAMS THE BALL down on the floor.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Jackie Moon. The most passionate man
in sports.</p>
<p><strong>bobby dee</strong>: Ladies and gentleman, put your hands
together for Downtown Funky- Stuff Malone! Clarence tosses the half
eaten candy bar, wipes his hands off on his jersey and jogs right out
onto the court during the game, TAGGING HIS TEAMMATE OUT as if it were
pick up.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Downtown, wastes no time entering
the game – tagging out Vakidis Roscovenski.</p>
<p><strong>.claws coach</strong>: C’mon Father Pat, he’s got to check
into the game doesn’t he? The ref just shrugs. Downtown calls for the
ball and gets it.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Downtown dribbles left, then right a
little shake and bake through the legs – double teamed now, he’s got
Twiggy Munson open under the basket. Downtown, still with the ball,
dribbles behind his back, they triple him, he’s got Munson and Ellis
wide open under the hoop, but look at these moves! The entire other team
leaves their men and guards Clarence five on one, but Clarence never
passes. His four teammates watch from under the basket.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Downtown has all five guys on him –
He sprints to the corner and forces up a fade away three… YES! Wow. You
think this league’s going bankrupt? Well, think again.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: People call him selfish. I call him the
greatest show in shorts.</p>
<p><strong>close on</strong>: An old-timey photo of a man with a
handle-bar moustache. It’s been autographed by the inventor of
basketball: ‘Go Tropics! -James Naismith’ The team enters the locker
room happy, even though they’re losing badly at half time.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Yes! Nice first half guys! That’s what
I call Flint Tropic’s basketball!</p>
<p>****: I’ve been telling you all season, we’re about to make a run.
Flint Michigan is destined for greatness. Twiggy, enough with the bounce
passes, let’s show some zip. Bee Bee, try not to get fouled so much,
free throws take too long. Scootsie, what did I tell you about catching
with two hands.? God gave you one hand for a reason: To look awesome.
Jackie points to the chalkboard. Where one of his catchy slogans is
spelled out.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Let’s stay focused on the four</p>
<p><strong>‘d’s’</strong>: Dangerous, Dangerous, Dangerous, Dunks.
Remember: This isn’t just a basketball team. It’s a lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Yo, Jackie, is the washing machine
broken?</p>
<p><strong>angle on</strong>: A few workers are taking out the washing
machine.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Listen up guys: I’ve got some good news
and I’ve got some bad news. The good news is, we’re getting rid of that
piece of shit washing machine. The bad news is, everyone does their
laundry at home from now on. Towels too. Everyone complains. Boo etc.
Jackie turns to BOBBY DEE a ‘front office’ guy.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: And Bobby Dee, I need you to clean out
your desk.</p>
<p><strong>bobby dee</strong>: No. I have kids.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: You’re not fired. I sold your desk.</p>
<p><strong>bobby dee</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: And I’m going to shed a few lockers, so
everyone’s getting a locker buddy.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Forget that. I need my own locker… For the
panty dropper. Clarence reveals his ‘panty dropper’ a brown full-length
leather coat.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Fine. Now, there’s one last thing: I’ve
added some depth to the roster. I think he could deliver some
firepower.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Firepower? Who’d you hire?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: At guard, six one, the hometown kid,
from your very own Flint Michigan – He punches in bunches Ed
MONIXXXXXXXX! We hear a TOILET FLUSH. Monix exits the bathroom stall
buttoning his pants.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You’re out of toilet paper. Monix doesn’t
receive a warm welcome. It’s more of a stare- off.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Okay, now, I know everyone in this room
has probably been punched in the face by Monix at one time or another.
One of you may have even had your collar bone broken, twice. But that’s
in the past now and-</p>
<p><strong>bobby dee</strong>: Yo, Jackie, you’re on in two.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Thanks Bobby. I love half time.
Anyways, welcome aboard.</p>
<p>****: One last thing: If you see a possum try and kill it. With that,
Jackie leaves. Monix faces his team in silence.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: So. Who wants to be my locker buddy?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Ladies and Gentleman, this man is about
to attempt the impossible. The $10,000 full court shot. So, tell me,
what’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>dukes</strong>: Dukes.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Okay, Dukes. You feeling it?</p>
<p><strong>dukes</strong>: Yeah dude.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What are you going to spend all of your
money on if you win? A shirt?</p>
<p><strong>dukes</strong>: Yeah man, a shirt. Ha! Whoooo!</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Okay people, Dukes is excited. Let’s
get some clapping going as he prepares himself for the impossible. This
is drama, folks! C’mon now, let’s hear it! The $10,000 shot people,
let’s hear it!!! For the first time, Dukes looks kind of serious. He
sizes up the distant hoop…</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: He looks ready… And… Here he goes! An
uncoordinated baseball pass… Sailing off into the distance… And…</p>
<p><strong>swish!</strong>: The crowd can’t believe their eyes.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>miracle!!</strong>: Jackie is freaking out. Dukes has just
won $10,000! Dukes runs around court, shirtless, leaping in
celebration.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Did he step on the line?</p>
<p><strong>father pat the ref</strong>: No, it was legal. He made
it.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Who the Hell has $10,000? I sure he
stepped on the line, you know what I’m saying?</p>
<p><strong>father pat the ref</strong>: Listen to this crowd. You can’t
screw a kid over like that. People will kill you. He’s right. The crowd
is too hyped for Jackie to explain that he’s broke.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Fuck me.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Monix was an All-American at
Michigan State, but then went on to a disappointing journeyman career in
the NBA. But he did manage to sit on the bench with the world champion
Boston Celtics years ago and won a ring.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: I should hire his agent. Kyle listens
to this and yells to the other room.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Hey honey, guess who got traded to Flint?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I don’t know, who?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Monix. The word Monix stops her in her
tracks.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Monix?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Yeah! He’s already got an NBA ring, but he’s
still playing… In Flint. Can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: No, I can’t. Lynn closes her book,
fidgety…</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: They say he asked to be traded. Who the Hell
leaves California to come here? I love this guy.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Get the funk outta-of-my-face…</p>
<p><strong>a sign says</strong>: THE KREMLIN. Jackie rolls up and parks
in a reserved parking space. He rolls up the windows and locks the doors
by hand and exits.</p>
<p><strong>reveal: jackie has giant ice packs taped to his
knees,</strong>: Patrick Ewing style, right over his slacks. A police
officer drinks, in uniform, outside.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: What’s up Jackie?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Not much.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Your knees okay?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Oh yeah. Just icing them down.</p>
<p><strong>ball girl maggie</strong>: Hey Jackie!</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Well look at you! You look beautiful.
What’s different?</p>
<p><strong>ball girl maggie</strong>: I dyed my hair.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: No, that’s not it… Did your tits get
bigger?</p>
<p><strong>ball girl maggie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Don’t lie to me. Those things got
bigger.</p>
<p><strong>ball girl maggie</strong>: No, they’re the same.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Well, good job. Jackie keeps walking,
bumping into MS. QUINCY, Clarence’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>ms. quincy</strong>: Yo Jackie. You know, that wife of yours
has been making out with that Mark Spitz lookin’ motherfucker all night.
She gestures to a guy who’s lip-locked with Jackie’s wife. LUCY MOON
unbuttons her fur coat.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Oh. It’s okay, Lucy and I’ve got an
open relationship.</p>
<p><strong>ms. quincy</strong>: I know that. But he’s about to suck on
her Damn tits, right here in front of all these people.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: She’s hot right? What can I say, we’re
freedom lovers. Hey honey! Lucy Moon ignores him, only making out
harder.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Right on! I’m not jealous. It’s a sweet
deal for both of us.</p>
<p><strong>ms. quincy</strong>: Have you ever slept with another
woman?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I could. That’s the beauty of it. No
ball and chain here.</p>
<p><strong>ms. quincy</strong>: Have you ever been to an orgy?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Pshh. Are you kidding? When haven’t I
been?</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: I heard Jackie is going to go to some
owner’s meeting. What do you think that’s about?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I don’t know, but it can’t be good.</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: Hey, let’s see that championship
ring, Monix.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: Yeah, you promised we could see
the ice. Monix takes the ring out. It hangs from his neck.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Look at this piece. It says Celtics right
there in diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: Why don’t you wear it on your
finger?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I don’t know, I just like to wear it around
my neck, that’s all. NOW CLARENCE chimes in without looking over…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Not everyone sits around dreaming of
playing in the NBA, you know.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: Maybe not. But you do.</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: Yeah, that’s all you ever talk
about.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You’re not jealous, are you Clarence?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: No one calls me Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: His name’s Downtown.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Okay Downtown. I’ll make sure Downtown is
only referred to as Downtown, okay Downtown?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Don’t think I don’t know what you’re
doing. You’re doing that thing where you pretend to mean what you say,
but you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Sarcasm.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Yeah. How’d you like that sarcasm smacked
off your face?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Bring it, funky stuff.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: That’s sarcasm, man. He’s doing it
again!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I got this, alright? Monix squares off
with a smile that says ‘hit me.’ Clarence takes off his leather full
length and folds it nicely.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: How’d you like a knuckle sandwich?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Knuckle sandwich? Who says that?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I do motherfucker. I’m gonna pound you so
hard, you’re– MONIX REARS HIS FIST BACK, about to release a strong
Popeye</p>
<p><strong>team, but i like it.</strong>: One of the party people, a
ball girl, GAYLE, interrupts.</p>
<p><strong>gayle</strong>: Excuse me boys. You mind, if I borrow your
friend for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Hold on a second.</p>
<p><strong>melinda</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Where’s the boogie? Jackie fights his
way through the crowd to the DJ booth.</p>
<p><strong>patrol.</strong>: SCREECH – The music stops.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: The year was 1973. A young musician
named Jackie Moon, finishes years of musical training, only to find he
is a slave to the notes on the page. He knows it’s time to break free.
In a sudden fit of creative mastery, he grabs a pen and a napkin and
writes a song that breaks all the rules. Ladies and gentleman… Let’s get
sweaty.</p>
<p><strong>music cue</strong>: Jackie’s song. Everyone goes crazy.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Baby, who wants to; love me sexy. baby,
are you ready to; lick me sexy. Take off your shoes and; suck me sexy.
Baby, we’re naked and we’re; humping sexy–</p>
<p><strong>gayle</strong>: I’m glad they traded for you, I got myself a
cute one.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: So, this is the Daiquiri room?</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: LUCY MOON, Jackie’s wife, is on the couch.
She’s the hottest girl in the world.</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: What do you think, Gayle? Does he like it
with my boots on, or does he like my boots off?</p>
<p><strong>gayle</strong>: He seems like a boots on kind of guy.</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: Then it looks like I’m ready. As soon as
you slide these shorts off of me.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Aren’t you Jackie’s wife?</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: He knows about the Daiquiri room.</p>
<p><strong>gayle</strong>: It’s a new tradition we’re starting, when new
players join.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I see. Well, I’m going to have to pass. I’m
good, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: Honey, you don’t know what good is. With
that, Lucy flicks on the stereo–</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Listen um…</p>
<p><strong>gayle</strong>: My name is ‘no strings attached.’</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: You can call me Mrs. Moon. Gayle and Lucy
perform a funky/seductive dance, moving closer and closer to Monix.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I don’t think this is going to happen,
Mrs. Moon.</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: It has to.</p>
<p><strong>gayle</strong>: It’s bad luck if you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Yeah, I’d hate to bring bad luck to Flint
Michigan. Lucy has sprayed some WHIP CREAM on her nipples.</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: Why don’t you lick these clean for
me?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I can’t eat dairy. Lucy decides that now is a
good time to aggressively KISS him. Monix pushes her away.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Nice tits, Mrs. Moon. I gotta go. Monix walks
down the stairs.</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: I see what this is: You want us to send
Eric and Marcus up here? On the way out, Monix flicks her off.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I got traded.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I mean, why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Can we talk?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: –Yo, Monix, you’re wasted! Ha! Kyle has come
out to say hi.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Yeah. Sorry man–</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What’s up! That of jump shot of yours ain’t
broke yet, is it?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: No. Ha.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Great back door cut for the lay-up in the
third. That’s how basketball should be played.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Kyle, can you give us a second? We need to
talk.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: No problem. Great game tonight man.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Why does your boyfriend like me so much?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You’re his favorite player.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Look, there are still some things I think we
need to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I’ve already said everything I’m ever going to
say to you.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I see.</p>
<p>****: Well, I guess I’ll be leaving then. Monix walks away… Then
turns back.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You’re really not going to stop me?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: No. Monix walks more, until Lynn speaks.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You’re going to end up walking with a cane the
rest of your life. You have to quit.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: And do what?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I don’t know… Kill yourself, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Kill myself?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You act like there’s nothing else in the world
besides basketball. If that’s how you really feel, then go ahead and get
it over with. I’m going to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Thanks for the pep. talk.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Lynn. Can I ask you for one favor?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You want a favor?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: My knee.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Oh, Jesus Christ Monix. It’s 4 a.m. Lynn
stares at him in disbelief. Monix shrugs.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: No one here can drain it right.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Fine. Monix nods, then makes a move toward the
door.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: No. You’re not coming in. We’ll do it in the
yard.</p>
<p>****: Well, hello Commissioner – Why sure, I would love one of your
Puerto Rican cigars – Oh, I know I’m a legitimate owner, you don’t have
to tell me that – We’re merging with the NBA? Oh, that’s nice – Ha Ha
Ha! Good one, Commish …</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Your Mom would be proud of you
today.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: .I’m sure each of you have heard the
rumors. And I’m here to tell you, the rumors are true. The ABA will be
merging with the NBA at the end of this season.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: Our league is sold. And the NBA agreed to
all of our financial demands! Now Jackie turns inward, more quietly
intense. This is, without question, the greatest moment of his life.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: You’re a real owner. You’re in the</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: Four of our teams will be absorbed into the
NBA family, the rest of you will terminate operations.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Exactly! You know it! I’m sorry, wait,
what?</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: The Nuggets, The Nets, The Spurs and the
Pacers will play in the NBA next year. The rest of us will dissolve.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Dissolve? Dissolve, like, how? How do I
dissolve into the NBA? The winning owners look at each other, not sure
how to handle Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: I’m sorry Jackie. We all know how.
emotional you get. We waited until the very last second to tell you.
Jackie pounds the table.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: No. NO! NO!!! He kicks over his
chair…</p>
<p><strong>the commish</strong>: We know you’re upset, Jackie. But
you’ll be very well compensated.</p>
<p><strong>losing owner #1</strong>: Everyone’s agreed to a very large
sum.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t want a sum! I want my team!
C’mon you guys, you’re not going to just sit here and take the money,
are you? They are.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What do the Spurs have that we
don’t?</p>
<p><strong>the commish</strong>: A huge fan base. A brand new stadium. A
solid economic growth package, including strong tax incentives.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Oh, c’mon, that’s BULLSHIT!</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: The NBA is taking four teams, Jackie,
there’s nothing I can do. Jackie goes quiet, thinking… An epic idea hits
him.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: The best four teams should go.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Forget the huge fan base, the stadiums,
the economic… Growing… package… inventions…</p>
<p><strong>winning owner #1</strong>: Economic growth pack–</p>
<p><strong>i know what i said!</strong>: The four teams with the best
records should merge.</p>
<p><strong>losing owner #2</strong>: He’s right.</p>
<p><strong>losing owner #1</strong>: Yeah, that’s the fairest way.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: These four teams DO have the best records.
Flint’s only won six games all year!</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: So far. The season isn’t over.</p>
<p><strong>losing owner #2</strong>: Yeah, maybe we should finish the
season first.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: This plan sounds like a lot of fun, but
it’s too late. The commissioner, me, has already decided.</p>
<p><strong>losing owner #2</strong>: Actually, the terms of a merger can
only be approved by a league mandate.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: YES. That’s right. What he said.</p>
<p><strong>losing owner #1</strong>: I move that we vote on the terms of
the merger.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: C’mon you guys, let’s try to stay
psyched. This is a chance to become a real NBA franchise!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: There’s no way we can make it to fourth
place. It’s mathematically impossible.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I ran the numbers. All we have to do is
win about eighty-two percent of our remaining games.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Eighty-two percent? Isn’t that a lot?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Oh, c’mon! We just gotta start hitting
our threes. Listen, I know this seems like bad news, but it doesn’t have
to be. This is a big road trip for us. We’ve just got to start playing
solid Flint basketball.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: I don’t know. We suck, man.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: We do not suck, okay? We just have to
want it!</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: What do you think, Monix? All eyes
turn on the grumpy one.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I think we suck.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Well… See, now there’s some team unity!
Now let’s load up the jet.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: A SHITTY SCHOOL BUS has the words ‘THE JET!’
Spray- painted in graffiti letters with a palm tree next to it.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Now we’ve got a special treat. You know
I take care of my family. Today, the Jet is catered. I had Downtown’s
Mom pack us some hot dish.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Ms. Quincy’s hot dish? Sweet!</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: Ah, watch the hot dish,
man.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Sorry Scootsie.</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: Hey Jackie, there’s some dude out
there, wants to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>pov</strong>: Out the window, we can see DUKES, the full
court shot winner, holding his GIANT CHECK and looking into the bus.
He’s still shirtless, with a star-spangled headband.</p>
<p><strong>dukes</strong>: I tried Jackie. They won’t take it. They said
it’s ‘symbolic.’</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What does symbolic mean?</p>
<p><strong>dukes</strong>: I don’t know. But they said I need a real
check.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t know what your bank is talking
about. That is a real check. I signed it myself.</p>
<p><strong>dukes</strong>: It’s written in glitter, dude. Can’t you just
give me, like, a regular sized one?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t get it. People are usually able
to cash these. Maybe you should try another bank. If you run into any
more trouble, let me know.</p>
<p><strong>dukes</strong>: Okay Jackie, thanks man.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Any time, congratulations. Jackie turns
away from Dukes and exhales, walking back to the bus.</p>
<p><strong>short people got, no reason to live</strong>: Jackie reaches
up into a special bin and takes out some beef jerky, then yells out the
window.</p>
<p><strong>to live…</strong>: Pan back to see the whole team crammed
into tiny seats. Vakidis has his knees pointing straight toward the
ceiling. Twiggy Munson is reading ’70’s pornography. Clarence is sewing
a new name onto his jersey. The rest of the guys are eating their hot
dish.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: So, Clarence, what’s in this ‘hot dish’
anyway?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: My Mom cooked your ass a whole Damn meal,
why you gotta go asking what’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: It’s a compliment. It’s good.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: If it’s good, then it’s good. Why do you
gotta know what’s in it? What’s in hot dish? Hot dish is in hot dish,
asshole. BEE BEE and SCOOTSIE look over the seat, facing them.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Hey Monix, what were the Celtics
like?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: They were fast.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: Fast? No one’s faster than me.
I should be on the Celtics.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Fast up here.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: You’re supposed to be Mr. Smartball.
Why’d you get bounced?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Well, you have to be able to jump too.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: Hey, let us see that ring
again.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Not right now, okay Twiggy?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Isn’t it a little embarrassing wearing
that thing everyday?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Embarrassing?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: You call yourself a Celtic? You sat
through every single playoff game. You didn’t see action once. And now
you walk around wearing the ice like you’re Bill Russel. Well you
ain’t.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Oh, you’re just jealous.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: Yeah, Monix played solid
minutes, for lots of teams. He’s played in the NBA, that’s more than you
can say.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Whatever. At least I never sat on the
bench and then called myself a champion. You didn’t do shit for that
Celtic team. If I was Dave Cowens, I’d yank that ring right off your
neck. That was a pretty heated exchange. Monix looks like he’s got
something to say, but he doesn’t. Clarence has the last word.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: He doesn’t wear it on his finger because
he knows he didn’t earn it. He didn’t even play.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: We’re just a few minutes away from
game one of the Tropic’s 6 game road trip. With talk of an NBA merger
hitting the league, there’s a new electricity surrounding tonight’s
game…</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Alright. Now, a lot of people out there
are writing us off. A lot people are saying things like ‘Jackie Moon is
an offensive liability.’ They’re saying ‘Flint’s turnovers led to sixty
fast break points per game.’ They’re saying ’Bee Bee’s retarded brother
is so retarded that his eyes look too big,. Like a French Bulldog.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: No one said that, man.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Yes they did. And we’re going to use it
as motivation, okay? THIS IS</p>
<p><strong>montage: flint plays harder but they still suck.</strong>:
JACKIE MOON sprints across the floor tries to get two f eet planted in
the lane. It’s not even close, JACKIE HAS TAKEN A GUY DOWN HARD. The ref
whistles a blocking foul.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: OH, C’MON!? Where’s the charge, Father
Pat?</p>
<p><strong>father pat the ref</strong>: Both feet weren’t planted.</p>
<p><strong>father pat the ref</strong>: That’s it, you’re out.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What!? What did I say? Jackie takes a
ball and drop kicks it, PUNTING IT high up into the rafters.</p>
<p><strong>buzzer! final score: colonels 111 tropics 92.</strong>: MONIX
drives the lane, fast and smart – A no-look pass hits Scootsie
Double-Day in the shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>buzzer! final score: squires 90 tropics 70.</strong>:
CLARENCE and BEE BEE jog back on Defense.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I ain’t guarding my guy anymore.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: He’s too’Damn sweaty, man. Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Gross. Well, I ain’t guarding him.
Monix notices this discussion.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Quit talking and play defense! The sweaty guy
backs in on Clarence, posting up top.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Right on! I’m open baby! Try a
behind-the-back! Monix delivers a nice two handed bounce pass, but
Clarence isn’t ready for anything fundamentally sound – The ball hits
him in the nuts.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Ah, shit.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I brought us some ice. Monix is startled.
Clarence, his roommate for the night, enters.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Ice? What for?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I don’t know, it’s free. Clarence takes
some ice, pops it in his mouth and starts crunching.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Want some?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: No thanks. Now BEE BEE enters, yet another
player in the small room.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: That Root Beer machine took my
fucking change, man. White people are assholes. Monix ignores this.
Laying back, he focuses on the TV: THE CELTICS are playing. Their
trapping defense is a thing of beauty. Clarence walks over and flicks
the channels, until he stops at ‘Love American Style.’</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You turned off the Celtics?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I don’t watch people play basketball. They
watch me. With that, Clarence pulls out a JOINT and lights it.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What the Hell is that?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: It’s a fucking Egg-McMuffin. Monix opens
the window, clearing the pot smoke out of his face. JACKIE EXITS the
bathroom, having just taken a shower. He’s wearing a very small robe.
This is now the fourth player who’s sleeping in this tiny room.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Why don’t you shower in your room?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: My wife is using it. I’ll be crashing
with you guys tonight.</p>
<p>****: Ice? Awesome. Love American Style? Turn it up.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Jackie, have you ever even slept with your
wife?</p>
<p>****: What? Are you kidding? Try, like, every weekend. She’s so
hot.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Sounds like a great arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: You guys need to wake up. Quit living
like it’s the 1950’s, man. Live it up. Hey Clarence, let’s have some of
that smoke, bro.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I’m pretty sure we have a game tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: This stuff won’t affect you. It’s
premium. Jackie finishes inhaling, then holds it out for Monix. He
stares at the joint, then around the room at his teammates.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Well, if this is really going to be my life,
I might as well be stoned like everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Well said. Monix takes the stupid
joint. The instant Monix inhales he</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What the Hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: It’s harsh.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Take that back.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Take what back?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: His Mom grows it.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Yeah, in the yard.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Your Mom grew this?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: It’s sweet grass.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Well, I’m finished, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: What’s wrong, my Mom’s weed ain’t good
enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: C’mon man, have some respect for his
Mom’s weed.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: That’s it, I ain’t sleeping in the same
bed as this motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>amigo manager</strong>: You want all the fans to sit on one
side of the stadium?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Yeah, just move all those people over
to this side.</p>
<p>****: See, the TV cameras are going to face this way, right? Well, if
we fill the seats on that side, we’ll look sold out.</p>
<p><strong>amigo manager</strong>: Actually, that’s not a bad idea.</p>
<p><strong>meanwhile, on the court</strong>: Both teams are warming up.
Clarence now has a new name on his Jersey. There are so many words,
there is barely space for a number. It’s a mess.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Check it out. I sewed it on the bus.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: What’s it say?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Jumping Johnny Johnson. The asshole,
PETRELLI, wanders over near the Tropics side of the court.</p>
<p><strong>petrelli</strong>: Yo, Granny Yarn Barn, how’s the needle
point going?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Kiss my ass, Petrelli.</p>
<p><strong>petrelli</strong>: Hey man, I think you spelled ‘Flint sucks
balls’ wrong.</p>
<p>****: This guy’s the next Betsy Ross! Aren’t you Clarence? The guys
laugh. MONIX walks up, defending his teammate.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: No one calls him Clarence. His name</p>
<p>****: What’s your name?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Jumping Johnny Johnson.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: His name’s Jumping Johnny Johnson. You got
that? Jackie hurries over.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Alright, break it up. Everyone huddle
up!… VAKIDIS! OVER HERE. Where is he walking to?</p>
<p>****: Fuck it. Listen up, we’re on National TV tonight. And you all
know what that means: The league needs a good clean game.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Oh, that’s a bunch of dog shit.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Hey! You guys want to merge or not?
Because the fastest way to screw this up is to start punching people in
the face while the commissioner is at home, watching the game with his
kids… Children are very impressionable. Their minds are not yet soiled
by the cruel realities of this world.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: No punching. Behind the huddle, FANS
BEGIN WALKING RIGHT ACROSS THE COURT. Both teams turn to watch this
strange thing. The Amigos manager leads the herd, Jackie helps out,
directing them across to the other side.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: This sold out crowd is loving this one,
the Amigos up by twenty-six here in the second. Monix drains a nice
jumper, but out of nowhere, Petrelli, the guy we hate, throws a hard
shoulder, knocking Monix to the floor.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: That’s a moving pick Father Pat! C’mon!</p>
<p><strong>father pat the ref</strong>: Play on. Monix can’t believe it.
Petrelli taunts Monix.</p>
<p><strong>petrelli</strong>: What’s wrong Monix, cat got your ’nads?
Monix faces off.</p>
<p>****: Not with the cameras. He’s watching. Monix looks around and
thinks…</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What about commercials?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Commercials, what about commercials? Jackie
thinks about this, then nods ‘good idea.’</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I like it. Time out Ref!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: A time out on the floor, 5:20 left before
the half, the Amigos 45, the Tropics 19, we’ll be right back after this
message from Shasta. The camera’s on air’ red light turns off.</p>
<p><strong>camera man</strong>: And… You’re clear.</p>
<p><strong>shasta commercial</strong>: I want a pop… I want a –
Shasta…</p>
<p><strong>kong</strong>: Hi-Ya!</p>
<p><strong>camera man</strong>: And we’re back in -5-</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: Welcome back to the ABA game of the week…
Players hold their heads in pain. Others limp back to the bench.</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: .The camaraderie and spirit of this
league is on full display here tonight… Off camera, Monix delivers a
secret punch to Patrelli’s spleen.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Okay, solid first half guys, but we’re
going to have to make some</p>
<p><strong>adj–</strong>: Monix interrupts Jackie, pissed. He addresses
the team, stepping in front of Jackie Moon.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: –This is bullshit guys. They’re kicking our
ass in basketball and they’re kicking our ass during the commercials,
too. Does anybody here understand the concept of the pick and roll?
Because they’re going to keep double teaming at the top of the key until
somebody rotates the Damn ball…</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Yeah! C’mon guys! Rotate the ball.
Monix looks at this group and gets even madder.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Does anyone in this room have any pride?
Don’t you realize, this is thelast four weeks of basketball anyus are
ever going to play?Is thishow we’re really going togo out?You’d think
we’d want toend ourcareers battling, hustling after every loose ball.
Boxing out under the boards. Setting picks for our teammates. But we
haven’t done shit out there. Twiggy Munson and Scootsie Double-Day hang
their heads.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: We’re a bunch of selfish assholes – And I’ve
got news for you, we aren’t going to finish in fourth, we’re going to
finish dead last. Monix paces in front of the guys, a man possessed.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: One day, you’re going to look back on your
life… And you’re going to look back on this time… And you’re going to
realize… Monix is staring right at Clarence. And Clarence is actually
listening…</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: .You’re going to realize you never even
played basketball. A moment of silence after the intensity. Monix
waddles to the door.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Now, you guys have fun out there in the
second half. If anyone needs me, I’ll be in the training room, draining
my knee. Monix limps off, everyone’s head is hanging low.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: He’s right.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Of course he’s right. But what the
Hell are we supposed to do about it? We don’t even have plays.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Dukes! I don’t make the rules. If they
can’t cash it, maybe you’ll have to go out of state.</p>
<p>****: I would if I could, but if I give you another check, that would
be two checks. That would be $20,000, not ten. What are you trying to
pull here? I’ve got to take this other call Dukes. Bye!– Flint Tropics
hot line… Oh hey Commish …</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Why do we have to put the court
together?</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: I guess the Ice Capades sold
out.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Yeah, kids love that stuff. Although,
I find the wild-life masks realistic and frightening.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Monix should be here helping us.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Guys. The guys look up to find Jackie.
He does not look happy.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: The commissioner just called.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I looks like we’ve got ourselves a
situation. We’ve got some new ‘terms and conditions’ for this merger
deal.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: What’d he say?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Basically, we’ve got to average at
least 2,000 fans per home game for the rest of the year.</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: 2,000 people? Every home game?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: He said the NBA will only take a
franchise that has fans.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Shit. Winning is going to be hard. But
getting 2,000 people to watch is going to be impossible.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Let’s try and stay positive. My Mother
always believed Flint was a town of destiny. And I believe that. Now,
I’ve already started work on a huge idea to promote us.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: What kind of huge idea?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Two more Johnny Walkers. And another pack of
Kools.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: You could use some fresh air, Monix. You
want to take a nap in the back of my truck?</p>
<p>****: Just the drinks and the smokes, alright?</p>
<p>****: Do you have any idea where Lynn is these days?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: She asked me to tell you to quit going to
her house.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Well, tell her that’s just fine with me.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Okay. Sorry man.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Monix.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Well, well, well, look who it is. Brian, I’d
like you to meet Jumping Johnny Downtown Funky stuff Boner- time
finger-blast Fag-erton.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Johnny for short. Two coffees.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: So, what brings you to the The Kremlin?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Listen, I know you and I haven’t always
been the best of buddies.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I hate to break it to you, Clarence, but the
Tropics will never play in the NBA.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: So maybe we won’t. But like you said, I
don’t want to look back on this with any regrets. I know what you think
of me. But I’m willing to put our differences aside. I’m telling you
right now, I’ll do whatever it takes to win.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You mean, like, pass?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I would consider passing, yes.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Sorry kid. Even if I wanted to play harder,
this knee won’t let me.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I’m not just talking about you playing
point guard… I’m talking about you teaching us… Monix could not be less
interested.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Monix, you know more about basketball than
any man who’s ever set foot in Flint. Monix drinks, not into it…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: All I’m saying is, instead of getting so
pissed off at us all the time, why not just show us what the Hell you’re
talking about? Coach us a little. I mean, we can’t get any worse.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: And why should I give a shit about the
Tropics?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I know you. You’ve got all that basketball
shit stored up in your head. I know you’re dying to pass it down to
somebody. Why not us?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What about Jackie? He’s the coach.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Jackie’s got his hands full, trying to
sell tickets. He’s obsessed.</p>
<p><strong>ecu: the tropic’s video on television.</strong>: ON TV: The
Tropics are performing a video not unlike ‘The Super Bowl shuffle.’ Each
member takes a turn rapping, dancing around wooden palm trees with a
smile.</p>
<p><strong>all the tropics</strong>: We are the Tropics hooping crew,
running and gunning and dunking on you – But we’re not here to talk no
trash, we’re just here to do the Tropical Mash – This is the worst video
ever made. All the guys boogie around until Clarence steps forward,
taking focus…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I’m Johnny Johnson and I got the moves –
If you try and stop me, I’ll just get smooth –</p>
<p><strong>kong</strong>: My name is Kong and I ain’t five feet – But I
get more ass than a toilet seat –</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: This is my team, so get to know them –
If you get near the lane I’ll yank your scrotum –</p>
<p><strong>all the tropics</strong>: – We are the Tropics hooping crew,
running and gunning and dunking too – We’re not here to talk no trash,
we’re just here to do the Tropical Mash – The ball girls trot out and
boogie with them.</p>
<p><strong>ball girls</strong>: – They’re not here to talk no trash –
they’re just here to do the Tropical Mash –</p>
<p><strong>cut back to:</strong>: MONIX CAN’T BELIEVE HIS EYES. Either
can the bartender. Monix ignores Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Two more Johnny Walkers.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: So that’s the way it’s going to be? Monix
doesn’t answer, he just drinks. Clarence gets the hint and walks
out.</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: LYNN lets herself in. Monix is so depressed,
he is non-plused.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Looking good Monix.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Thanks. You too.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Ms. Quincy told me the Tropics asked you to
coach them.</p>
<p><strong>ecu: a sharp needle pierces flesh.</strong>: Lynn is draining
Monix’s knee. It looks painful.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I know what it takes to be a real team,
Lynn.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Stay still.</p>
<p>****: And that’s the reason you won’t coach them?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: It doesn’t matter. The truth is, I hate
basketball right now.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Do you really hate basketball? Or do you hate
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Why would I hate myself?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Well, for one, you cheated on me.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You hate me for that. Not me. Lynn just
stares at him.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Okay, maybe I hate myself a little.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You don’t wear the ring around your neck
anymore. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I rode the bench through the playoffs,
Lynn.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Monix, that was greatest moment of your
career. And you look back on it like some kind of embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Riding the bench was the greatest moment of
my career?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: You did more than ride the bench, Monix.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What else did I do?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Every practice, you took your team to the
limit. I know you did. I was the one draining this stupid knee of yours
every night. The Celtics were practicing against you, Monix. And when
you ran that scout team, you were running Milwaukee’s offense better
than their first stringers ever could. Lynn continues the business of
disposing fluid into the toilet and preparing another syringe.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: By game time, your team knew where Milwaukee
was going to be before their own players did. The Celtics made the right
adjustments to win that series. And those adjustments came from you.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: So, I should be proud of running the scout
team?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Dave Cowens put that ring in the palm of your
hand. And he told you to wear it with pride, because you were a
champion. And he meant it too.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: He was being a nice guy. The bench is the
bench.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Your whole life, you’ve bitched about people
playing selfish. It takes a team to win, right?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: But when you’re on the team, your effort
doesn’t count? Is that it?</p>
<p>****: If you weren’t on the Celtics that year, would they have won
it?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Watch that needle.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Answer me. Would they have won?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Yes you do. You know. Monix looks away for a
moment.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Why are you doing this? What does any of this
matter, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What’s it matter? You’re drinking yourself to
death!</p>
<p>****: God, I wish I hated you as much as you hate yourself! Lynn
throws the needle. Monix dodges it.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I made sacrifices! How many years did I
support you? And finally, after all of our blood and sweat and bullshit
together, you got there, Monix! You made it, you won an NBA championship
ring. It wasn’t just about you, okay? And I’m sick of you acting like
you’re some kind of joke. You didn’t blow it. You’re not a fraud. You’re
not a fake champion. And all the time we spent together, fighting for
you to get to that moment, was not a waste! You’re a champion, you
asshole!</p>
<p>****: 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and turn like you mean it – Bee Bee, Arch
that back. Yes. Now, the waterfall… One by one, each dips down like a
waterfall. And now a leg kick.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Nice leg kick Kong. Those flexible hips
are a coach’s dream.</p>
<p>****: Now big finish – and freeze. And then we start the game after
that.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Are we going to practice or what?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: This is practice, okay Clarence? We
need to get two thousand people in here! Our intro dance has to blow
people’s minds. He begins pacing around, more passionate than ever…</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: From now on, I want our afros bigger…
And shinier … . I want our shorts shorter… And tighter… We’re going to
pull our tube socks up higher than we ever have before. The team seems
to be looking off screen.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>reveal</strong>: Monix has been watching this whole thing.
With Monix on the court, everyone feels kind of stupid.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Hey, you’re back! Listen, you should
probably chalk your hands up for this number.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Jackie, I asked Monix to coach us.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Coach? Jackie is totally thrown by
this. He looks around at the team. Clearly, a decision has been
made.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What do you mean, coach? What is this?
What’s going on? It’s a Mutiny.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Jackie. Don’t be like that.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Hold on a second. Last time I checked,
we didn’t live in Flint, Russia. We live in Flint, America. I’m coach
until a new one is elected.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Don’t make us elect Monix, man. Alright,
show of hands. Who wants Monix to step in as player-coach? Everyone
feels bad, but they all raise their hands.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Please God No.</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: Sorry Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: It’s cool. I get it. I’m a big boy, I
can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Don’t take it so hard, Jackie. You’re a
great owner. We all know that.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Woah. Hold on. Did you just say ‘great
owner?’</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Yeah. Everyone thinks so.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Now, when you said great owner, were
you just saying that? Because it’s not cool to mess with me about
this.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: We mean it. For real. Monix is just more
of an X’s and O’s kind of guy, that’s all. Jackie is emotional. It’s a
bittersweet moment. He takes off his whistle, then walks over and hands
Monix his whistle.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Here. You may need this. Now he pulls
out a bunch of crazy notes on loose paper written in ball point pen. The
pages look insane.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: And here are some ideas for plays I’ve
jotted down. Just thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Thanks Jackie. The way I see it, any team in
this league can put together a run. Most of our opponents are all flash.
If we play unselfish, fundamental basketball, we can win games.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I like it. Unselfish, guys.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Yes. Unselfish. Unselfish meaning tough team
defense, full and half court traps, boxing your man out to help the team
rebound.</p>
<p>****: Unselfish means sprinting up the floor on every fast break NOT
because you can get a DUNK – and get your DICK SUCKED after the game –
but because if you sprint up the floor you might pull the defense out of
position and free a teammate up for a high percentage shot.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Wait, so, what’s going on with the blow
jobs?</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: I vote we keep the blow jobs.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: All in favor? Everyone raises their
hands in favor of blow jobs.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Would everyone let the man talk please?
Clarence is serious. This shuts everyone up.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: The most important work we do on the court is
away from the basketball. Monix FLIPS OPEN A SWITCH BLADE KNIFE AND
STABS THE BALL, deflating it. This gets everyone’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Until you start moving like a real team, you
practice without a ball.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Alright, Clarence, run the offense.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I don’t get it.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Set a pick for somebody. Clarence jogs over
and stands next a scout team opponent.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Okay, that’s kind of a pick, I guess. Try
standing on the other side of Scootsie’s man, so you free him up to cut
into the lane. Monix corrects Clarence, moving his body the way he wants
him to stand.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Widen your stance. Plant your feet. Hands
back. Like this. Now Scootsie GO. Set a pick for Jackie. Scootsie cuts
across the lane. The team slowly gets i rotating faster.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Now Jackie pick Bee Bee’s man, and rotate to
the rim like this… Everyone move to the open space. And Clarence you
swing back out up top. They’ve completed the play. Monix stands there,
smiling. The players look at each other, what’s the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You know what that was?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: What.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: A flash to the high side post with an outside
screen and a back door cut. Let’s do it again.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Hey, how come you don’t have to run
with us? You’re a player, just like the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I’m saving my knee for the games. Coach’s
decision. NOW RUN. Clarence sets a screen for Scootsie and they perform
the same basic rotation.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: We’re not just rotating, we’re clearing out,
making space. A pass and cut can change defensive match- ups. Creating
seams can give us back door looks. Down screens can make a team
vulnerable to penetration.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Hold on. I’m lost.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: No shit. What’s up with all of these
fucked up words, man?</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: Yeah, what are we, building some kind
of basketball space. ship?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You don’t have to understand it yet. Just run
it again. You heard me – AGAIN.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: We’ve been running this play for a long
time, man.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Yeah, maybe we could try, like, play
number two.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: No. We’re running this play. We’re running
this play until we puke.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Basically, we have.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Yeah, I’m pretty beat.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: ‘Until we puke’ is not a figure of speech. We
are literally going to puke.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What does he mean by ‘literally?’</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I think he’s talking about vomit.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Not cool.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Monix, can I talk to you for .a
second?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: No. No talking.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>go!</strong>: Jackie hangs his head, but then accepts his
fate. He runs.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: We need to get in shape fellas. And we need
to learn some fundamentals quick. – AGAIN! They run it again, getting
more and more winded.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I want you to be brain dead. Because someday
you’re going to be too tired, or too nervous to think - - AGAIN! And
when you are, this is the play I’m going to call. The play that your
lungs and legs will have memorized. We will be able to run this in our
sleep. Clarence tries to gag himself with his fingers.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: HEY! No sticking your fingers down your
throat, Clarence, I saw that. You’re going to puke. And it’s going to be
all natural – AGAIN!</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: You’re fired!</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Get up and run. You’re going to puke like
everybody else.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Monix, I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: We’ll. talk after you puke. GO!</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I can’t puke Monix!</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Yes you can. Go. Jackie crawls harder along
the hardwood.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Monix! You don’t understand. I’ve never
thrown up in my life.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I’ve never puked. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: That makes no sense. Everyone has thrown up
before.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I haven’t. I swear to God. I can eat
anything. I can drink anything. I’ve been sick, but I’ve never puked. I
swear to God.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: That’s bullshit. Keep moving, you’re going to
puke.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t puke. I can’t do it! It’s the
truth! I swear on my Mother’s grave. At this point, Monix can’t help but
be intrigued.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What about when you were a baby? Babies throw
up all the time.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: My Mom said I never did. I swear. She
said I was fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: You can call my Dad! I’ve never puked.
When Jackie looks up at Monix, it’s clear he is not lying.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Isn’t that kind of dangerous?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What happens if you swallow poison?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t know. I ate bad sausage before.
But nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Stand up. Jackie manages to stand up.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Have you ever been punched in the
Jejunum?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t know. What’s a Jejunum?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: It’s part of your small intestine.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t know. I doubt–</p>
<p><strong>monix’s powerful fist lifts jackie’s torso in the
air.</strong>: ECU: Monix’s knowing fist digs deep under Jackie’s rib
cage. It’s the hardest punch ever filmed.</p>
<p><strong>on jackie’s reaction</strong>: He stands, beyond pain, empty
of any possible air. The blood leaves his face andhis eyesbecome
confused, watering strangely. Part of Jackie’s brain wants tospeak,buthe
feelsunhuman– his lips separate only slightly. He wanders out of
frame.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Mom?</p>
<p><strong>shrub. jackie wails in despair.</strong>: MONIX stands in the
doorway, watching this.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You okay? Jackie is about to speak, but then
takes stock of his feelings. There is now an air of tranquility about
him. Reborn. He’s almost Euphoric…</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I’m beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: .On offense, we share the ball. We look for
the easy pass, not the spectacular pass… Jackie rolls off the pick and
looks for it. For the first time in this sequence, we see the ball.
Clarence has a clear passing lane – He feeds Jackie for a lay up.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: . If a guy’s more open than you are, he gets
the ball… Instead of celebrating, Clarence hustles back on Defense. The
Tropics execute a half court trap. As we watch Monix play, we continue
to the voice over from practice…</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: .On defense, we’re going to learn to play
together. We’re going to use team traps to pressure people into
turnovers. On the in bounds, Monix and Jackie Moon trap an opponent.
Monix slaps the ball free. He flips to Clarence who fakes; the fast
break dunk and dishes to Scootsie.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Can you believe that? Jumping Johnny
Johnson actually passed the ball.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: It was a great pass, too. The other
team calls time out.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: And Jackie Moon has made several
great defensive plays down the stretch. I tell you, Jackie’s not afraid
to knock people around in the lane. He’s a monster.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: Like a retard in a China shop. A
twenty-second time out on the floor, Monix huddles them up.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Listen up. I’ll in-bound. Clarence, protect
the ball and penetrate if you can. Kick it out to Scootsie or me and
everyone crash the boards hard. Looking good, we’re thirty seconds away
from taking this one home. Let’s bring it in.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: He’s right guys. But remember, we want
to win, but not by too much.</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: We don’t want to win by too much?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What the Hell is he talking about?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: He’s worried about the corn dogs.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: If we score a hundred points, everyone
gets a free corn dog. There are signs everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I’m sorry, Monix, but we don’t even
have corn dogs.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I don’t give a shit. We’re taking it to
them.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: We’re up by seven, Monix. Can’t we just
take it easy? We’re talking about a lot of corn dogs here.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: There could be a riot.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I don’t give a shit about the corn dogs,
okay? We play hard every second. We’re running the offense. Everyone got
that? Everyone nods. WHISTLE!</p>
<p><strong>announcer</strong>: The Tropics are just one bucket away from
the magic number. Listen to this crowd. They know what’s at stake: A
free corn dog. Monix has the ball in his hands. He in bounds to
Clarence. Clarence penetrates and kicks it to Scootsie. Scootsie has an
open look. He sizes up a jumper…</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Look at this, Jackie Moon has just
blocked his own teammate’s shot. I’ve never seen this before.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Vakidis takes it up strong to the
basket…</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Ooh. He gets taken out hard by the
coach.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: Nice! The ball bounces into the air,
rolls around the rim… And</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: And the basket is… GOOD!</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I asked you up to the Daiquiri room,
because this is a private matter. As you know, I threw up recently.</p>
<p>****: And I want you to know, I just mailed out 562 corn dog
coupons.</p>
<p>****: And I’d like to bring somebody special in… DUKES! Dukes walks
in. He is still shirtless. Jackie hands him a duffel bag.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: In this bag, is ten thousand
dollars.</p>
<p><strong>dukes</strong>: No way. Really?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Actually, it’s twenty three hundred.
But I’m going to pay you the rest. The Tropics will not let you down.
From now on, I want my conscience clear.</p>
<p><strong>dukes</strong>: Wow. Thanks Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Can I confess something to everyone?
It’s something I’ve never told anybody.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: You know my song ‘Love Me Sexy?’</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: Everyone knows that song.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I stole it.</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: It’s true. My Mom wrote it. Three weeks
before she died. And I stole it. Even Monix is fascinated by this.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Wait, your Mom wrote that? Was she a
singer?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: No, she wrote it on a napkin. I duped
the whole world. I’m nothing but a fraud.</p>
<p>****: It’s true, I’m a famous singer. And I’ve landed the hottest
wife in the world. But, to be honest, we usually only sleep together
once a year. On VJ day.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Damn. VJ day? That’s cold.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: And even on that day, I don’t feel like
it’s me who’s sleeping with her.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: She married me because of my song, but
I didn’t write it. So sometimes I feel like it’s not even me who’s with
her. Deep down, I feel like it’s really my Mom who is making love to
her. When I hold Lucy’s supple breasts in my hands, they are my Mom’s
hands. When I eat a pair of edible panties off of her, they are my Mom’s
teeth.</p>
<p><strong>dukes</strong>: That’s pretty weird.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I’m living in a prison, Dukes.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Why don’t you write a song yourself? Then
you wouldn’t feel like a fake any more.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Oh please! I could never write anything
as brilliant as ‘Love Me Sexy!’ Listen to me, Tropics. Today is a new
day. I am going to be the greatest basketball owner you’ve ever seen.
And we’re going to make it to fourth place.</p>

not big enough.</p>

eighty three here tonight.</p>

<p><strong>monix</strong>: Will you marry me?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You heard me.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Technically, we’re still married right now,
Monix.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Do I?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Do you love me?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Probably.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Then let’s do it. For real this time. I need
you.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Shit. I know you need me, Monix. The question
is, do I need you?</p>
<p><strong>what’s up monix!?</strong>: Kyle pokes his head out of the
screen door. He wears a Flint Jersey with Monix on the back.</p>
<p><strong>yeah. ha!</strong>: And I suppose you need him?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: He’s loyal.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Dogs are loyal.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: He ain’t stupid, if that’s what you’re trying
to say.</p>
<p><strong>no problem, i’ll leave right now.</strong>: Monix and Lynn
meet eyes. Lynn tries not to smile, trying to be mad. Kyle pulls on some
jeans and gets into his truck.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Don’t fuck with him. It’s just rude.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What do you think you’re doing?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: What’s up. I forgot my stupid walle- -Kyle
stops in his tracks. He HEARS a sound he’s never truly heard before,
Lynn having an orgasm. He slowly walks toward the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>kyle’s pov</strong>: Peeking around the corner, we spy Monix
and Lynn still going at it.</p>
<p><strong>on kyle</strong>: His whole body goes numb, his face turns
red… We hold on his face until:</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Monix?</p>
<p>****: Yes. Still undetected, Kyle settles in to watch the show, still
wearing his Monix jersey. Lynn finally looks over and spots Kyle. We
can’t be sure, but his hand might be in his pants. Lynn can’t believe
her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Stop that.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Stop what?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Ixne-on-the-erking off-je. Monix finally
notices his sex partner is having a conversation. He turns to see
Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Woah. What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Monix, you of dog!</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What the Hell are you doing!?</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Hey, I’m the victim here. I’m allowed to do as
I please. This was an honor.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What? Monix stands up, wrapping a sheet around
him.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I’m outta here.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Oh, c’mon man. Don’t be like that. It’s all
cool.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Believe me, this is not all cool.’ Monix
grabs his shit and walks out of the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I’ll call you.</p>
<p><strong>kyle</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Not you, asshole. He was talking to me.</p>
<p><strong>officer miller</strong>: Hey is that Coffee Black? I’m
officer Miller, State Correctional, I’m a big fan, you can call me
Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>officer miller</strong>: Jackie Moon ordered up a bus full of
prisoners. Any idea where we all should sit?</p>
<p><strong>pan</strong>: The PRISONERS are all packed into the stands.
Next to them is a huge group of ladies from an OLD FOLKS HOME… Next to a
bus load of SICK KIDS from the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>center court</strong>: In a wrestling ring, Jackie is in a
wrestling singlet, wearing head gear, drinking from a squirt bottle. PAN
TO DEWIE THE BEAR, ready to go. CLARENCE, DRESSED AS A REF, is standing
in front of JACKIE, messaging his shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: We sold out, man. You did
good.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I’m scared of bears, Clarence.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I hate these things. I’m freaking out
right now.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: If you’re scared of bears, why the
Hell are you wrestling one then?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Look at this place. We’re packed. It
was a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: Well, don’t worry, you’ll pin him
easy. It’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: You don’t understand. I don’t like
bears. I’m feeling dizzy. Jackie is seriously petrified. Clarence
adjusts the collar of his ref jersey and looks around, worried about his
friend.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: Maybe we should call it off.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: NO. Look into my eyes. You’re the ref
tonight. No matter what happens in there, do not stop the fight,
okay?</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: Okay, until you finish the first
round, I won’t call it. Hey, how bad can three minutes be, right?</p>
<p><strong>bear handler</strong>: Are you guys ready? The bear handler
is a large frizzy haired woman.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: I don’t know, are we ready?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Yeah, let’s do it.</p>
<p><strong>bear handler</strong>: You guys want to give me a safe
word?</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: What’s a safe word?</p>
<p><strong>bear handler</strong>: It’s a word for you to yell to the
Ref, so he can stop the match.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t need a safe word.</p>
<p><strong>bear handler</strong>: Tell you what, if you get injured or
you really feel like you’re in danger, yell, um, I don’t know… Spumoni.
Once I get a signal from the ref, I’ll come in.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: What’s Spumoni?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: It’s an Italian Gelato, sort of like
Almond flavored ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: Is it good?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t know, I’ve never had it.</p>
<p><strong>bear handler</strong>: It’s really good. Okay, so Spumoni is
the safe word then?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: No, I don’t need a safe word, okay?
Let’s just do this. One round. DING DING DING! The bell has rung. The
crowd goes crazy. Clarence assumes his position as ref. Jackie walks
slowly toward the bear, frightened. They bear scratches his belly, cute.
Jackie immediately quits.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Okay, fuck this.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: What? You can’t quit already.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: SPUMONI. I’m out of here.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: You can’t SPUMONI, all he did was
scratch his nuts.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Well, too bad, I’m SPUMONI-ING. PEOPLE
START TO BOO. Jackie looks around at the angry crowd.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: You gotta give ’em a show. C’mon,
the bear seems pretty tired, look at him. It’s true, the bear is pretty
docile. The bear’s indifference gives Jackie a glimmer of
confidence.</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: Just test him out a little. Maybe
it won’t be so bad. Jackie nods, then hops around with his dukes in the
air. Now he does a shuffle for the crowd. After dancing a bit, the bear
is still motionless.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: C’mon Dewie… What’s going on? Is he
going to–</p>
<p><strong>clarence the ref</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>bear handler</strong>: Woah-ho. I’ve never seen that
before.</p>
<p><strong>gelato! almond ice cream!</strong>: Asta zittu’sto parcnuso
spumoni!</p>
<p><strong>bear handler</strong>: Screw this, I’m stopping it. The bear
handler tries to get into the ring with a stick and loop. But CLARENCE
TRIES TO PUSH THE BEAR HANDLER back out of the ring.</p>
<p><strong>spumoni!!!</strong>: DING! The first round is over, but the
bear does not return to his corner.</p>

<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Oh, hey Commish. Good game huh? And a
packed house too.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: I need to talk to you… And the rest of your
team. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: I’m sorry, but even if you beat the Spurs
on Friday, we just can’t have an NBA franchise in Flint.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: It’s just not good business. Flint isn’t a
big enough media market, okay? This stadium is small and, frankly, it
needs to be torn down before someone gets hurt. I’m sorry but nobody
ever thought you guys could ever get this far.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Well tough shit. This team did make it
this far. Rules are rules.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: Rules are rules… Until the expansion
committee makes new rules. Then those rules are the rules. Everyone
looks at each other. Jackie’s brain has slipped into a deep trance. He
is no longer inside his body.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: Don’t take this personally, Jackie. These
other teams have strong markets, new stadiums. It’s just not going to
happen for you Flint boys. I’m sorry. The devastation of what is
happening is palpable. Nothing has ever hurt this bad before.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: I know you’re going to punch me, Jackie. So
let’s just get it over with. The commissioner stands brave, eyes closed,
chin out. Jackie is too confused and devastated to hit anything. He
stumbles out of the room like a zombie. The team follows. The
commissioner opens his eyes. A long silent beat…</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: How did I get out of that one? Suddenly
KONG darts in and squeezes the commissioner’s balls with a kung fu
grip.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: Ah!</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: This can’t be happening.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: They can’t just do this, can
they?</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: We can get a lawyer, dude. We
can fight this!… Can’t we?… Monix? Monix just looks to the ground, as in
‘it’s over.’</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Jackie… Please… Say something. Jackie
opens his mouth… He tries to speak, but he can’t.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Are you crying?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t know. I’m trying to. I wish I
could just puke this away. Do it to my Jejunum, Monix. Help me. But
Monix is leaving. He turns and walks off, alone down the dark street…
The others walk away too…</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Wait! Monix! Where is everyone
going?…</p>
<p><strong>montage: players of flint are down and out.</strong>:
-CLARENCE walks alone along the river.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: In an American Basketball
Association policy shift, it seems the Flint Tropics will not be playing
for an NBA birth after all… -BEE BEE ELLIS stands in the middle of the
Tropics court, upset. -JACKIE walks, sad, along the streets of Flint –
Now he suddenly picks up a pipe and SMASHES THE WINDSHEILD of an
innocent truck. He turns and TACKLES A GARBAGE CAN.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Friday’s match-up against the first-
place San Antonio Spurs will be the Tropics final basketball game…
-SCOOTSIE DOUBLE DAY finishes spray-painting the words ‘BULLSHIT’ on a
wall. REVEAL: He is in his own child’s nursery room. The baby starts
crying. -The TROPICAL AISLE guys are fat and shirtless, burning their
Hawaiian shirts outside the stadium.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: And if that news wasn’t bad enough
for the Tropics, we’ve just been informed that Coffee Black, the team’s
top scorer, has been traded to the Spurs.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: At least someone from Flint is on his
way to the NBA next year.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Thought I might find you here. I got
traded.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Yeah, I heard.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I guess the San Antonio Spurs are picking
up the players they want, before we’re eligible for the expansion
draft.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Coffee Black, going to the NBA…</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: They won’t let me finish out with the
Tropics. So, we’ll be playing against each other in the last game.
That’s pretty weird.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: It won’t be weird. The game doesn’t
count.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Listen I’m sorry about–</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Don’t be sorry.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I mean, I just want to say that, this
year, you really–</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: –DON’T. Alright? Just don’t. Clarence stares
at him. Then eventually stands up to leave. There are a million things
he wants to say, but he says this:</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: We worked so hard.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Well, it was all for nothing.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: So, that’s just it then?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: That’s just it. Clarence shakes his head and
walks out.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: What the fuck are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Oh. Hey Lynn.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: I thought the deal was, you were going to
sleep.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Pshh. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: So, you’re just going to sit here in my house
and drink for the entire day?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You got a problem with that?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Yeah, I do. Maybe you could put some pants on
and go piss off somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Fine, maybe I will!</p>
<p>****: Where are my pants?</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Tell me something, Monix-</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Whatwereyou trying to accomplish thisyear?You
never really gave a shitaboutthat NBA merger, did you? Monix doesn’t say
anything.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: The merger, Monix, did you ever care about it?
Monix still stays quiet.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Tell me, if you didn’t care about the merger,
what the Hell were you playing for!?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: I wanted fourth place! Okay? That was the
whole fucking thing!</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Well, guess what! Fourth place is still
sitting there, waiting for you to win it! Monix doesn’t look at her.</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Think about it.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Baby, who wants to- love me sexy! baby,
Ugh, are you ready to; lick me sexy!!!? Yeah yeah!! HA!</p>
<p><strong>inside a dumpster, reveal</strong>: Jackie lays in garbage
and sings up to the sky. It’s official, he has lost his mind.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I’m a big faker and I stole this;
Song-ly sexy. I’m the biggest failure in the; world-ly sexy. I’m going
to kill my; self-y sexy.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Jackie? Bee Bee Ellis hears Jackie
voice and discovers him in laying the garbage. Jackie ignores his
teammate.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I’m going to hang myself with an
extension; cord-y sexy.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Jackie! What the Hell are you doing
in a dumpster?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I am urinating in my pants right
now.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: You gotta get it together, man. Monix
called a team meeting.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Listen up. We all know that Clarence has been
traded. And we all know that this game doesn’t matter anymore,
right?</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Well I’ve got news for you. This game does
matter. It matters because this is the last real basketball game any of
us is ever going to play. Ever. The guys nod, solemn.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Tomorrow night, I say we leave it all out
there on the floor. Because there’s nothing else for us to save it for.
Clarence or no Clarence. NBA or no NBA. Merger or no merger. We decided
we are going to win fourth place. And that’s what we’re going to do.
Jackie is moved. The guys look at each other and nod.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Over the past five weeks, we’ve become a
team. And that is no small thing. Jackie, have you ever been on a real
team before?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: How does it feel?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: It feels pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: All your lives, you’ve dreamed of playing in
the NBA. Well, guess what? Tomorrow night, you are. You’re playing an
NBA team. And for one night, the world is going to know that you
belong.</p>
<p>****: Look, I tried to pretend like it didn’t matter to me if we made
it to fourth or not. Monix turns inward, speaking with an emotion that
is pure.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: But the truth is, I want this more than
anything I’ve ever wanted in my whole fucked-up life.</p>
<p>****: And I think you do too. I think you can taste it. Because we
earned this. We made this happen. And we’re four quarters away from
making our dreams come true.</p>
<p><strong>fourth place!</strong>: Pumped, they jump around, ready to
make their own history.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: The Spurs may be the #1 team in the
league, but they’re going to have to prove it on Friday night.</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: Since this game doesn’t count, Jackie.
What exactly is your motivation?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: We.’re going to win this game, because
we want it. It’s as simple as that. That alone should make people want
to show up and root for us. Jackie and the announcer look at each other
for a long moment of silence…</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Plus, this is the FLINT MICHIGAN</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Save your ticket stubs, the mega- bowl
is an historic event.</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: I’m not sure I understand.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: It’s a Mega-Bowl. What’s not to
understand?</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: This game has no effect on–</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: –The Mega Bowl trophy is twelve feet
high. AND IT IS GLORIOUS.</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: I’m sorry, but this sounds like
something you just made up.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Well, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>tv announcer</strong>: Well, it doesn’t make any sense.
They’re just words.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Oh please. You’re just words.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: if the commissioner is listening, I
recommend he stay out of the city of Flint tonight. He’s not too popular
in this town.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: i will stab him in the stomach with an
eight inch hunting knife.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: There were many wild protests in
Flint this week. But it seems like the whole city is now focused on
beating the San Antonio Spurs. This team seems to have captured every
heart in this town of underdogs. People have poured in from around the
state to support this drive toward their first mega-bowl
championship.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: The Flint Tropics will be playing
without their number one scorer, Coffee Black tonight. The Spurs have
signed several new players from around the ABA, locking them in before
they hit the free market in next year’s expansion draft. The .big man,
Pete Petrelli has been sent over from the dismantled Anaheim Amigos. Now
Petrelli enters frame. The guy we hate has been traded to the Spurs
too.</p>
<p><strong>petrelli</strong>: We may be teammates, but I still think
you’re a dick.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Thanks Petrelli.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You want to know what I love? This. The
eleven of us right here, right now, waiting for the biggest game of our
lives to begin.</p>
<p>****: I want you to remember something. I want you to remember what
this feels like, to be here in this locker room together, one last time,
shoulder to shoulder with these men. Because we are not ourselves
tonight. We are one. This is what I love.</p>
<p>****: Let’s play basketball.</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts</strong>: PETRELLI knocks over Monix and scores.
-The Tropics offense is getting shut down. -Jackie gets a rebound, but
then dribbles off his ankle. -The fans are disappointed. The guys in the
Tropical Aisle are all bummed out. Wheelchair Jody looks pissed.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Not a good first half for the
Tropics so far. They’re already down by ten.</p>
<p><strong>on clarence</strong>: He sits on the Spurs bench.</p>
<p><strong>spurs coach</strong>: Coffee Black, you’re going in.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I can’t. I’ve got back spasms. The coach
stares him down, then picks another player.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: This is easily the worst half of
basketball the Tropics have ever played. And that’s saying
something.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: Yep. It’s a shit fucking sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Let’s watch the F-bomb, Lou. We’re
live.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: Oh, please, this is our last game. I
can say whatever I want. Watch this: I hope Gerald Ford gets ass
raped.</p>
<p><strong>live tropics radio</strong>: Okay then. We’ve got just
fifteen seconds left in the first half… Here’s Monix with a no-look to
Jackie… He goes up strong–</p>
<p><strong>lynn</strong>: Oh my God. Everyone in the stadium watches as
Jackie lays out cold.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: I’ve never seen anyone take a hit
quite like that before. This looks serious. CLARENCE looks worried from
the Spurs bench.</p>
<p><strong>spurs coach</strong>: Do not leave this bench, Coffee. BEE
BEE leans over Jackie, worried.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Jackie? You awake?</p>
<p><strong>father pat the ref</strong>: Bring in the stretcher!</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: We don’t have one.</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: I don’t want to speculate, but I’m
pretty sure he’s dead. MONIX gets in Petrelli’s face.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What are you trying to prove Petrelli? You
afraid to play basketball?</p>
<p><strong>petrelli</strong>: Hey, check the scoreboard. Monix attacks
Petrelli.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Now Monix is after Petrelli. This is
total chaos.</p>
<p><strong>father pat the ref</strong>: Let those fifteen seconds run
out! It’s half time! Everyone off the court!</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: And at half time. It’s the Spurs 60,
the Tropics 29. The guys carry Jackie off the court and into the locker
room.</p>
<p><strong>on clarence</strong>: He’s had enough. He stands up and
begins walking across the court, to join the Tropics.</p>
<p><strong>spurs coach</strong>: Where the Hell are you going?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I’m going to my team.</p>
<p><strong>spurs coach</strong>: This is your team. You are not leaving
this bench. From the front row, the COMMISSIONER hears all of this and
stands up, surrounded by security guards.</p>
<p><strong>commish</strong>: You sit down! You’re not playing with those
idiots ever again. If you walk away from this bench now, you’re never
coming back. I’ll see to it you never play in the NBA! Ever! Do you
understand what I’m saying to you, Coffee?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: My name ain’t Coffee. It’s Clarence. With
that, Clarence walks across the floor. The crowd erupts.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Look at this. Coffee Black is
walking over to the Tropics. This crowd is going crazy! Clarence takes
off his Spurs jersey and throws it into the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: Clarence!</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What the Hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: I’m with you guys.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Are you out of your mind? You want to lose
your NBA contract? Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: You’re going to give up the NBA for this?
Well, you’re a fucking asshole. Jackie. Are you okay buddy? Monix cracks
a smelling salt and waves it over Jackie’s face.</p>
<p><strong>jackie’s dream mom</strong>: Now, I want you to go forward,
and tell the others what I have told you here today. Do you understand
me, son?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Yes Mother. You are so kind.</p>
<p>****: I’m sorry I stole your song.</p>
<p><strong>jackie’s dream mom</strong>: I forgave you for that a long
time ago. I’d say it’s about time you forgave yourself.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I don’t want to leave this place. It’s
so fluffy. I miss you, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>jackie’s dream mom</strong>: I miss you too, Jackie. Now, you
gotta wake up. You’re missing the game.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Oh. I am? That’s bad isn’t it?</p>
<p>****: Can you make time go backwards?</p>
<p><strong>jackie’s dream mom</strong>: Not really. Now hurry up. And
don’t forget what I said. Jackie walks into the clouds, then turns
back.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Hey Mom, I threw up.</p>
<p><strong>jackie’s dream mom</strong>: I know you did, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>jackie’s pov</strong>: Bee Bee Ellis, Twiggy Munson, Scootsie
Double- Day and Kong Yi look down at camera.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: He’s awake.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: This just in. It sounds like Jackie
Moon is up and around the locker room. That’s good news for the
Tropics.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: And I don’t care how quick their defense is,
we need to move the ball and–</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: –Hold on you guys. I have something to
tell you.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What is it? Jackie seems very serious…</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: I had a dream. I had a dream, I was in
heaven and my Mother spoke to me… She was wearing a flowing white gown…
And she showed me a whole new way to score a basket. She spoke to me and
said with this gift, you will win fourth place.’</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: He’s lost his mind.</p>
<p><strong>twiggy munson</strong>: We need to figure out what we’re
going to do in the second half.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: Yeah, we don’t have time for
any ghost baskets.</p>
<p><strong>don’t you understand?</strong>: Jackie’s eyes are intense and
he’s breathing way too hard. This dream was real. Monix tries to pacify
him.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Alright Jackie, relax, okay?</p>
<p><strong>otherworld!</strong>: Monix and Clarence shoot each other a
look. Clearly, Jackie is not going to take no for an answer.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Okay Jackie, so what’s the play?</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: We’re back in action here at the
Mega Bowl. Coffee Black is playing for the Tropics… And Jackie Moon
makes the start… In fact, it looks like he’s trying to run the offense
here… Jackie dribbles at the top of the key, doing a lot of pointing
along with multiple hand signals.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: This is a new offense for the
Tropics. Jackie dribbles to the top of the key… And… Jackie makes eye
contact with Clarence. Clarence cuts to the basket and Jackie throws him
a lob.</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: As Clarence leaps, we hear Jackie’s voice
over from the locker room…</p>
<p><strong>jackie</strong>: I had a dream. And in my dream, my mother
jumped… Her gown flowing in the wind… And she caught a pass in the air
and dunked it, without ever touching the ground…</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: Clarence catches it and slams it hard.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: .She lifted her veil and said ‘I call
this the Alley Oop.’ Everyone stands there, astonished. The other team
is frozen. The fans are confused. The ref has no idea what to do.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: .And she said it would change the game
forever… The other players are starting to appreciate what they’ve just
seen.</p>
<p><strong>spur #1</strong>: Damn, bro.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Woah. I’m sorry, I don’t know what
just happened.</p>
<p><strong>spur #2</strong>: Doesn’t he have to dribble first?</p>
<p><strong>lou redwood</strong>: What the Hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: Hey Jackie, isn’t that against
the rules?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: No. My Mom said it was fine. The whole
arena is waiting for Father Pat the Ref to process this information.</p>
<p><strong>it’s traveling!</strong>: WHISTLE! Father Pat The ref waves
his hands.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: The ref has stopped the Mega
Bowl.</p>
<p><strong>win! i will burn your house down!</strong>: The other players
stop Jackie’s attack. Monix steps over and calmly states the facts.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: It’s not a foul unless you touch another
player. And it can’t be traveling without first establishing a pivot
foot. It’s two points, Father Pat, two points. Father Pat the Ref thinks
about this…</p>
<p><strong>for flint!</strong>: The crowd goes nuts. The other team
protests. Jackie points to the sky, right through the hole in the
roof.</p>
<p><strong>quick cuts: the tropics alley oop their way to fourth
place.</strong>: -Clarence slams down another alley-oop. Wheelchair
Darren and Wheelchair Jody go crazy.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: There it is again, Clarence leaping,
and forcing the ball in a downward direction through the goal net off of
a high arching pass – Hold on, I’m being told this is called an Alley
Oop. Yes, That’s easier to say. -Another Alley Oop! Dukes, shirtless,
pumps his fist.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Jackie lobs to Clarence again. YES!
Another Alley Oop! The Spurs don’t know what’s hit them. -Monix double
teams and forces a turn over. In the back of the stadium, LYNN can’t
help but scream.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Monix with a steal– A long bounce
pass to Scootsie Double-Day for a lay-up.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Monix penetrates– and– Wow! He
flipped it up behind his back and Clarence slammed it home with one
hand!</p>
<p><strong>scoreboard</strong>: SPURS 100, TROPICS 99 – : 15 left.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: In all my years of radio, I’ve never
seen anything like this. The Tropics have fought their way back from a
twenty nine point deficit. With twelve seconds left to play, they’re
down by one point. A basket here could win it.</p>
<p><strong>it’s the final play</strong>: The fans pray. Monix takes a
deep breath, then in bounds the ball–</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: Jackie dribbles, looks up and lofts a
perfect pass to Clarence…</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: Clarence flies up for the alley oop slam
dunk…</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: At the last second, Petrelli flies into
frame and swats it away!</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Petrelli with the rejection! It’s
out of bounds – The Tropics keep the ball, with seven seconds on the
clock. I’ll tell you Lou, the Spurs were looking for that one.</p>
<p><strong>in the huddle</strong>: Monix is yelling above the noise.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Okay, listen up: They’ve made adjustments out
there. We can’t just keep running the Alley Oop, okay? They’re keying on
Clarence. Everyone looks at each other, worried.</p>
<p><strong>scootsie double-day</strong>: We’re not going to run the
alley oop?</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: What are we going to run?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: We’re going to run The Puke.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: The Puke?</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten it. Everyone
smiles at each other. They haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: We’re going to pick away from the ball. We’re
going to move to the open space. I won’t in bound the ball until someone
has a good look. . The Puke.</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Bring it in! One two three–</p>
<p><strong>let’s get tropical!</strong>: THE TROPICS RUN THE PUKE: A
flash to the high side post with an outside screen and a back door
cut.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Monix, looking to inbound…</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: Clarence sets a pick for Scootsie- Everyone
rotates. Jackie picks and rolls to the basket, open… Monix zips Jackie a
no-look pass…</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Jackie goes up strong…</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: No Good! But Petrelli fouls him!</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: Jackie Moon will shoot two free
throws here, his team down by one, with two seconds on the clock. One
will tie it. He needs both to win it. The ref hands Jackie the ball. The
players take their places along the lane. Jackie steps to the line. The
whole arena is on pins and needles.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Don’t worry you guys, I got this… I am
awesome at free throws.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: I’ll tell you, I don’t remember the
last time I’ve ever seen Jackie attempt a free throw…</p>
<p><strong>thing.</strong>: Now Jackie sets up for the shot…</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: What the Hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: What, you’ve never seen me shoot free
throws before?</p>
<p><strong>clarence</strong>: He shoots them Granny style.</p>
<p><strong>bee bee ellis</strong>: Always has.</p>
<p><strong>monix</strong>: Shit. Jackie’s ritual is insane. He breathes,
spins the ball, turns around 360, deep knee bends, touches his left
shoulder four times, then SUDDENLY WINGS THE BALL HIGH IN THE AIR.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: The first attempt is… GOOD!</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: The game is tied. One more and the
Tropics win. Jackie does the same ritual. But this time a bead of sweat
rolls over his forehead. He is nervous. But he tosses anyway…</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: The Ball floats toward the basket. Flash
bulbs pop.</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: The ball bounces off the rim, away from the
basket.</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: Monix elbows his way into position for a
rebound.</p>
<p><strong>live aba radio</strong>: No Good – Monix with the put
back!</p>
<p><strong>slo mo</strong>: Monix catches the ball in the air and
re-shoots a fade-away jumper. Swish!</p>
<p><strong>mega bowl!</strong>: Victory. All the Tropics go crazy,
screaming, they pile on top of each other at center court. The crowd is
going nuts. Wheelchair Darren and Jody roll out onto the court. Dukes
jumps into the pile of players. Lynn has tears in her eyes. In the
madness. LUCY MOON finds her husband, Jackie.</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: Jackie!</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: Lucy?</p>
<p><strong>lucy moon</strong>: Kiss me, you hero.</p>
<p><strong>jackie moon</strong>: My Mom says you’re a bad lady. She says
