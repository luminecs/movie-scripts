<p><strong>klute</strong>: Klute. With a K. K - L - U -</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Are you with plant security, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Town Police.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Then how are you involved?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I know Tom Grunemann.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: You knew the subject Thomas Grunemann. How
well?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: We grew up together. Kids.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Can you account for his disappearance in any
way?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Did he recently appear to you agitated or
depressed? – indicates no – Did he voice to you grievance or discontent
with his research work here? Indicates no. Moral or sexual problems or
peculiarities? –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Marital problems in general? Indicates
possibly – am I right Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Everybody’s got some, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Did he ever mention specifically a girl or
woman in New York?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Examine this letter please. We recovered that
from the shredder – the plant disposal and incinerator system. Grunemann
apparently typed it Friday, before he left, decided not to send it,
tossed it away. We’ve already contacted the New York Police; they think
they know the girl in question.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: He never mentioned this type thing to you? You
didn’t know he had these interests?</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: My husband was not like that! My God,
Klute.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It looks like he sent her quite a few of
those Holly – the girl – she recalls six or seven letters like –</p>
<p><strong>holly</strong>: – No. I mean sure a little rough stuff, but
just what people usually – No, I would’ve said we were pretty good.
Johnnie I don’t understand. I just don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: – has disclosed no evidence of crime or
criminal intent within the jurisdiction of this bureau, and since
subject Thom –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: It’s been almost a year! Tom Grunemann’s been
missing for a year. And all the FBI has to offer is a report that must
bore even you.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Well sir.</p>
<p><strong>streiger</strong>: Are you closing the case?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: No sir, we don’t state that. We’re countin
–</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: But you don’t find it worth much effort.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Well Mr. Cable, you’ve got me here from the
Bureau. You got Lieutenant Trask here from New York representing his
department and I don’t frankly consider –</p>
<p><strong>streiger</strong>: Why couldn’t you ever find out anything
from the girl?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Trask –</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: We first hold her under surveillance expectin
your boy Grunemann to show up there. Didn’t. Then we bagged – we
arrested her on a CP charge, convicted, two month’s women’s city prison,
offer to reduce sentence, she cooperated. Four interrogations. She
thought she remembered Grunemann – from those letters from before, she
made that connection – but she hadn’t seen him since and couldn’t
identify his photograph and she –</p>
<p><strong>streiger</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Oh a good call girl, she’ll turn six-seven
hundred tricks a year. The faces get blurred. And since then, recent
months, she’s reported several, you know, incidents: like breather
calls, anonymous phone calls, also somebody maybe following her,
watching her, things like that. So it’s I guess you could say,
conceivable Grunemann’s still around there, just hangin around her,
spooking her. But you know, that –</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: The subject got emotionallv disturbed; he just
dropped out. There’s thousands.</p>
<p><strong>streiger</strong>: Inspector we understand your position;
ours is a little different. We have an investment in Tom Grunemann. The
Company has an investment, and we feel entitled to investigate for
ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Private investigation, you mean. Yes sir, of
course you’re entitled, and there’s some very competent –</p>
<p><strong>streiger</strong>: Klute offered us his services; we’ve
accepted.</p>
<p><strong>streiger</strong>: Klute knew Tom. He has a great many ideas
about the case –</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Yes sir, we know he –</p>
<p><strong>streiger</strong>: We’d expect him to work in cooperation
with you. He’d report to each of you and to our Company’s New York
office, to Pete – Pete goes there on a regular schedule back and forth,
and –</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Mr. Streiger, speaking frankly – we’ve
appreciated the Sergeant’s interest you know, all along. Here, locally.
But New York, that’s - well –</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Ever done any missing person’s work?</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Spent much time in the city? You see, I have
to wonder – speaking frankly; the Sergeant knows I’m only speaking
frankly -</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You wonder why we thought of Klute? Frankly?
He’s interested.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Honey, no, we don’t have too many.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Now before it comes to that, let’s have a
look, et cetera, et cetera –</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: – Honey you make it look a little real. It
should have, you know, that fun to it.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Strangle him to death funny?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Well we go from this into stomach
diagrams. It can’t be too – look let’s try it again from -</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: No – just give us the faces at the end,
would you?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: – And another family saved by Elso
tablets. OK – Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Pierce – Danner -</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Bree Daniel, any messages? OK, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Trina? Bree. Do I? Oh no, just a commercial I
thought I might get, that’s all. Well I’d take a quick thirty, hon. Do
you have a commuter for me? Wait.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Hullo.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Ooh, I knew I’d like you.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Lover, that’s got to be a little extra. I mean
it sounds very exciting, what you speak of, you’ve got me all excited.
But something special like that, you know it’s got to cost a little
more, mm?</p>
<p><strong>1st annc’r</strong>: –R - W - M, radio’s voice is the
Shippensburg Valley, on a beautiful clear warm Thurs –</p>
<p><strong>2nd annc’r</strong>: – Tucky Wonder Beans picking up a half
cent over yesterday’s price at-</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh lover, oh it’s too much – oh you thrill me
– yes, like that, it’s – oh it’s beautiful, oh –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Miss Daniel? My name is Klute – John Klute
–</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Can I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What about?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: My name’s John Klute.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You said that.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I’m an investigator. I’d like to ask you some
questions about Tom Grunemann.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Gee.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora
Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I’ve
been hired to look for him.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: You know what I’m talking about. Miss
Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Honest?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Will you let me ask you some questions?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You’re not police or FBI; you’re just a
private investigator?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: And you just want to ask me a few
questions?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – and I take acting classes with Lee Tainter
–</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: – Lee, yes –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – and I was in two of his workshop type
productions, Uncle Vanya and the girl in Five Characters – – here – and
then of course I have the modeling and the demonstrator work, the
trade-fair work – but naturally I feel ready for something more, well
you know, sustain –</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Well, thanks very much for coming in.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Man, just a poor pretty little hooker, like
to be an actress –</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: What you lookin’ to get from her? You think
she’s got Grunemann hid somewhere, the attic, feedin him soup? Or maybe
he’s hidin in a dark alley and he’ll jump on her and you jump on him.
And third place, even if she does know somethin’ she’s right, she don’t
have to talk to you. You don’t have police power, you can’t make
her.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: That’s a lot of people to die unknown.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Unknown, unidentified and unwanted. And
there’s more every day man, there’s more everyday.</p>
<p><strong>bree voice</strong>: Bree Daniel. Yeah, hi hon.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh hon, I just don’t know. I’m trying to stay
out of it.</p>
<p><strong>girl’s voice</strong>: – comes in with these other yulds
maybe two or three times a year, and five big ones baby, just one
evening.</p>
<p><strong>bree voice</strong>: Marta, thanks, and I’d love to party
with you hon, but –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Well try to get someone else Marty and if I
change my mind – sure hon, bye.</p>
<p><strong>bree voice</strong>: Bree Daniel –</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Oh God baby, oh God I really love
you.</p>
<p><strong>bree voice</strong>: That’s nice; who is this?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: I really love you baby, you know
that?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Hello? Hello? Oh my God, hello?</p>
<p><strong>bree voice</strong>: Bree Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man’s voice</strong>: Bree – Frank Hanley, you remember,
Fayetterville?</p>
<p><strong>bree voice</strong>: Oh yeah, hi Frank, sure.</p>
<p><strong>2nd man’s voice</strong>: Well I’m in town, like to see
you.</p>
<p><strong>bree voice</strong>: Well Frank that’s awful nice but I’m out
of action, sort of, you know –</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: Bree Daniel, Caucasian, twenty eight, good
physical health, no narcotics record, presenting an unusually strong
personality some ways, high intelligence, a high bracket call girl.</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: – Usual case history – this isn’t a
medical confidence, it’s all of them – broken family, lonely, confused,
crummy childhood, early promiscuity, formal prostitution beginning in
her teens, income twenty-five to thirty thousand a year. Oh they don’t
keep the money: they get rid of it, they get pimps. Why? Why do you want
to know all this?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up
in it.</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: Not unusual.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Did she talk about him to you?</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: About his letters – that’s all she
remembered. Quite violent material, I’d say, obsessive, a quite sick
man. But that’s not unusual either.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Has she talked with you since prison?</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: No. She had every good intention of it –
coming to me as a private patient, getting out of the life, devoting
herself to an acting career.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I think she’s trying that.</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: Oh sure they try. The idea of a better
life. But they don’t really know much about life: They get confused – or
scared or frustrated or bored – they pop back to the one thing they can
handle. The trick. The trick. Men in bed. Not men in general, not life,
not love, not even real sex – it avoids all that. Just the trick, the
transaction.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: We had a bet on - if you were real or not. I
won.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Marta –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Hi. Bree. Hi. Well I could come over tonight -
if you’d like – if there’s no one else. I really want to just talk to
you.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Hi? -_</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You scared me, Mr. Faber.</p>
<p><strong>mr. faber</strong>: Good material, not too good cut. I’d do
better for you.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh thank you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. faber</strong>: Enjoy. Well –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: It’s good to see you. Well – could we do it
first and then just talk?</p>
<p><strong>mr. faber</strong>: Sure dear, yes.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Well – well I’m just back. And – I must tell
you – something quite wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>mr. faber</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played
baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis
quite enthusiastic for me – but a young man can be so silly –</p>
<p><strong>mr. faber</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: And then one night – at the gaming tables –
well I just saw him. A stranger – looking at me – and I knew suddenly
that all my life I’d been –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – May I? It’s so –</p>
<p><strong>mr. faber</strong>: Please –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Not young; he wasn’t young – gray at the
temples, he – well actually he looked like you.</p>
<p><strong>mr. faber</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: And nobody could tell me who he was – an
exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or – but I felt it
stirring inside me, this – this wild, pagan feeling –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: And next day at the beach – our beach pavilion
– I saw him again, his eyes burning into me. I was helpless. Without his
even speaking to me, without his even touching, I knew that somehow –
somehow –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Whyn’t you just cut out?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh you bastard.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I
just don’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No, I’m look –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: If I was taking calls full time would I be
living in this kip? I’d be back on Park Avenue; I could support the
whole National Guard!</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Could I ask some questions?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Or you’ll get me shoved back in the brig you
mean; another month with the bull-dykes.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look, I told the police everything: I don’t
even remember the schlub!</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: They showed me that one. I understand it’s
Grunemann, but I told them, I just don’t remember.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: A family sort of man.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: – Tom, again.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Company outing or picnic or something like
that.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Isn’t that sweet. Well it could be any one of
them bubi; I get to see them all.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look – please – will you just try to get it
from my side? A year ago. I was in the life fulltime. I was living on
Park with leather furniture and a million dresses. Then they dropped on
me, the fuzz, they caged me – they started asking me about a man, some
man, I’m supposed to have seen a year before that. Two years ago, two.
He could be in Yemen!</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me
pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had
I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: – Tuscarora –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild
letters – I’m watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you
et cetera. Well, they said, all right that’s Grunemann. So try to
remember when you and he - when – well I don’t know, there was that
dumper once, he sounded like that dumper – Dumpers; they get their kicks
beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me -
that’d be about two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: OK Tommy-baby, Allie-Allie-in-free kid, I got
the gumdrops.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You remind me of my uncle.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: What? What do you remember about that –
dumper?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Nothing. Except he wasn’t kidding. Usually
it’s a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you
wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you –
Hell it’s their money. I’ll hang from the shower rod and whistle
Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: But you can’t say that Dumper was Tom
Grunemann.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I can’t say he was anybody!</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: So – OK – that’s all?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Well could I have them back now hon? – those
tape recordings you’ve got downstairs – OK? – and if you want you can
have a good time and I’ll have a good time and–</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: What about everything since?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Everything that’s happened since Tom
Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Just phone calls, right? They ring, you
answer, they don’t say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks.
Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that
proves –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: What about the other things you’ve reported?
– – being followed on the –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look – I’m sorry – I’ve led everybody wrong. I
mean yes, I get those feelings, but that’s just me, that’s just
feelings. I’m sure this will amuse you; I’m scared of the dark. And
sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or – well, I’ll come out in the
morning and think someone’s been prying at my mailbox, or there’s a
little – trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for
– do you see? – things other people wouldn’t even notice. Well that’s
not real, it’s just nerves; it’s got nothing to do with –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Bree Daniel. Oh yes, Ted Carlin, how is Ted?
Oh, well, thank you very much but maybe the next time you’re in town?
Well I just love Ted and I’d love to meet you – you have a very nice
voice – but I just – Well I’m having a chat with a very nice cop.
Actually not a real cop; he’s a private inves –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Is that how you get most of your dates?
Someone gives your name to someone else?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Most of them.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Is that how you met the Dumper? – Someone
else gave –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: How would I remember?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: How else do you meet them? Pimps?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You’re very square. Pimps don’t get you dates,
cookie; they just take the money.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I have some names the police gave me. Frank
Ligourin. Will you tell me what –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look, I’m sure this’ll amuse you too. Ilia
trying to get away from all that.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: What about the old gentleman the other night,
Mr. Faber?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You saw that, goddamn you? You saw it? He’s
seventy. His wife’s dead. He started cutting garments at fourteen. His
whole life, he’s maybe had a week’s vacation, I’m all he has and he
never, never touches me, and what harm in it, what –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Klute, tell me, what’s your bag? Are you a
talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young
– children – or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or
have us watch you tinkle? Or –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – You want to wear women’s clothes, or you get
off ripping things –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – you perverted hypocrite square bastards.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Gee I hope this doesn’t make my cold any
worse.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Tell me about Frank Ligourin.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: When? When did you and Ligourin break up?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Mind not doing that?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What? This?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I thought you could trick me for those tapes.
Don’t you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you
someone; I have terrific friends, wild.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Gee. I’ve had men pay two hundred dollars for
me – here, you’re turning down a freebie. You can get a perfectly good
dishwasher for that.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You’ve changed your mind? You do want to
play?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I don’t want you to look up. There’s someone
on the skylight.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Easy – pretend you’re looking here- –
here.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Now I’m going to walk around – you just keep
talking, straight through, straight through.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Tell me about acting – what are you doing
tomorrow – where do you go?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I go on rounds.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Rounds, what are they? – don’t watch me, keep
talking.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You go see agents – or Equity calls, open
casting calls. And ad agencies – commercials – you don’t get work, you
just go around.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: And they’re always polite – show people – they
say thank you very much. You lie there covered with blood, smiling, they
say –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I couldn’t get him.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Well do you think it was him?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Can’t you get him?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Maybe, if you tell me the things you
haven’t.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You asked me where I got that date with the
dumper – Frank sent me on it.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Do you know where he got the dumper?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: He never told me.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Well, let’s go down and ask him.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What did you expect? Frankie still has a good
string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Is that what you gave him?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Bree – hi – come in, come in.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Frank – Klute.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hi. Come in. I was just catching up some work
– mocking up the photographs. I used to be a photographer myself - Bree
tell you? – Before I got in the publishing.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Frank, he knows you’re a pimp. He knows you
were my pimp.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well Bree, maybe you’d rather –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How’s it been?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: With me Bree it’s eternally the same. Toward
you. I guess you know that.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Yeah Frank, I know that.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve always respected Bree. I’d like to make
something clear.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I’ve just got a few –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’d like to make something clear. I don’t go
after a girl; a girl comes to me. Her choice. Right?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I’m looking for a man. Tom Grunemann. Bree
thinks he may have been the dumper – that call she had two years ago.
She says you sent her on it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Two years ago? Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring
someone around to look at your arms?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look – dad – I may stand better with the cops
than you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: OK, a family matter. Between the girls. I had
two other cows – – two other girls besides Bree.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: She told me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: OK and one of them Jane McKenna – she blows a
little jealous of Bree - you know? – Bree comes first? And evidently she
knew the freak — that he was a dumper – she conned me into passing him
to Bree, you know, so Bree’d get hurt. I didn’t know. Till
afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Why didn’t you tell Bree, afterwards?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You don’t tell them. That one of their own
in-laws laid a dumper on them? Peace in the family. Beyond that, I don’t
know. All she wrote.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I’d like to talk with Jane McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Would I be telling you all this? She copped
out long ago. She committed suicide Baxter.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Did you like my friend Frankie?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Didn’t he tell you what you wanted?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It didn’t go anywhere. But that’s not why
–</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: About the dumper, didn’t he tell you that?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It was Jane McKenna who sent you the
dumper.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Well – she’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I thought you were going back to the
apartment.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: You said you wanted these.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh golly, oh just what I’ve always dreamed of,
dirty phone calls. How come?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: You told me what you could. I guess I’m
through with your part of it.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Is there anything more I could –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I don’t see anything, do you?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What’re you gonna do next?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Try some other ways.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What do I do meanwhile? – wait for that clown
to fall through the skylight on me?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: And I don’t think that was Tom.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You said it was!</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No, I said what did you think.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh – wait – oh I get it. You said that just to
keep me scared. So I’d tell you everything I – oh clever; oh you smart,
tricky hick.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A
little?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yeah, you got to me.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the
wickedness?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Oh. No. Not that way. I’d say it was more – I
don’t know – – too bad? Pathetic?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What the hell do you mean, pathetic?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It’s kind of late.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: It got lonely upstairs. There’s someone on the
roof.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh, don’t be a doo-doo.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Not much point to this, is there?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Ezra, I’m lots better than you’re used to.
Tell me – the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber – wasn’t your
tongue a little bit hanging out?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: So you’re not too different from him, or the
chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look, if you don’t use it somebody else just
will. And you’ve done your whole bit with me, your entire duty, and so
now this is my thing. So enjoy, Mr. Faber would say, enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Bree – thanks – I don’t want to.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh don’t be all hypocrite. Or do you really
like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? – so you
don’t really need to –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Who the hell are you, buttoning me up?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I knew it, I knew it, a killer.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh lover – oh you thrill me – oh, it’s
beautiful – oh yes, yes – oh like that, like that, yes –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What’s the matter hon? You were great.
Terrific. A tiger.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Well what’re you down about? You mean because
you didn’t get me there? You can’t expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he’d
get me there all the time – but never with a John.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: And I’m sorry I can’t stay and learn your
special little games. And I certainly don’t want you to feel bad about
this – losing your virtue all of a sudden – because I sort of knew you
would. As I said, like everyone, right?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Besides - you can always tell yourself you
made me come downstairs. Ta, luv.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – Why?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Why – please, why? – Why lose, why look? Why
hate and give and want and love? Why get, grieve, g –</p>
<p><strong>jang</strong>: Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – gug – gug –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Why? – I want to know what.</p>
<p><strong>jang</strong>: No, that was very good everybody. Do we have
all your resumes?</p>
<p><strong>producer</strong>: Booth – Osman – Zuff – Anjeris Chaka.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: You asked if there was anything more you
could help me with.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I’ve checked the records of Jane McKenna’s
death – I can’t get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another
girl you said, besides McKenna and you.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Arlyn Page.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it
cut his travel-time.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper
too.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she’s
the one who started Frank. She’s strung out now; you won’t find her.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: You could help me find her. You know the
people. I’ll pay you a hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I can make that in a lunch break! Look, Hiram,
you’re sure it isn’t just me? – you decided you liked it, after all, the
other night; you’ll hang around for seconds?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Don’t worry.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Joanie – Mike, hi – Hi Pat.</p>
<p><strong>pat</strong>: Hey Bree honey, who you got?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: A new daddy. I’n he cute?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.</p>
<p><strong>trina</strong>: Oh yes Mr. Klute – won’t you both join me?
And how do you like our fair city? There’s so much here don’t you think?
The museums and the books and the foreign films – Bree, have you seen
the Godard film?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Uh uh.</p>
<p><strong>trina</strong>: Oh you’ve got to. He does such fun things
with imagery. And I’ve been reading The Fall – – The Fall by Ahlbair
Camoo – it’s the same thing, you know the imagery –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn
Page.</p>
<p><strong>trina</strong>: Why? She’s a junkie.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: She was with you after she left Frank.</p>
<p><strong>trina</strong>: Well she’s not now. I did everything for
Arlyn. I loved Arlyn I took her right into my apartment, my own sweet
apartment on First. But she wouldn’t stay off it – the junk – and I wept
and I pleaded and I held her in my arms - and she started taking things,
my things, and selling them for horse. My clothes. We could’ve had
everything together, everything – and then the bitch sold my mink!</p>
<p><strong>first girl</strong>: Arlyn Page?</p>
<p><strong>second girl</strong>: You’ll never catch up; she’s grooved
out.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Gil?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I’m not looking for her personally - someone
she might know about.</p>
<p><strong>pimp</strong>: Try Janie Dale.</p>
<p><strong>janie dale</strong>: It’s old Mr. Clean from Cleveland. He
wants to know when he can fly in and clean up the apartment and see you.
I told him I have all the cleaning equipment and that he can come
anytime, but it’s up to you.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: You know he wants us to be dominant.</p>
<p><strong>janie dale</strong>: Tell him that he’d better have his ass
in here by one o’clock on Monday afternoon or you won’t let him clean
the bathroom floor, and tell him the price has gone up twenty bucks –
Old Dutcn Cleanser’s not as cheap as it used to be.</p>
<p><strong>janie dale</strong>: You wanted to know about Arlyn, honey? I
had to let her go dear. Arlyn stopped being reliable. I deal with a high
type client, business people, you understand? I can’t send them someone
that’s all the time half zonked out.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Do you know where she went?</p>
<p><strong>janie dale</strong>: Try Momma Reese.</p>
<p><strong>momma reese</strong>: Try Bill Azure. If you can find
him.</p>
<p><strong>azure</strong>: – a couple weeks then she’d drift off a
couple of weeks, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Have you heard from her recently?</p>
<p><strong>azure</strong>: She liked me all right but she had what she
liked better, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Have you heard from her recently?</p>
<p><strong>proprietress</strong>: – She’d come in and I’d let her have
something. Why not; she’d been a good customer, a beautiful person, a
beautiful beautiful person.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vasek</strong>: The whore, yeah. I threw out.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Do you know where she went from here?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. vasek</strong>: Live like animals. Her and the man.
Out.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Was she living with a man?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: What’s the matter?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What the hell do you think’s the matter. I
could wait for you someplace.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann
–</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – Then you don’t need me.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: But if it’s someone else I do.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You sure pull a lot of mileage out of a
hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: Cappy?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Arlyn? Honey? Look, it’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Is it Cappy? Cappy? –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Arlyn, it’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Cappy, I got a radio!</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: No –</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: Bree – honey - please, we’re waiting for
someone.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions –
something you could help us about.</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: Can’t you see I’m strung out? Please, we’re
waiting for it – he’s got to have it!</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: We’ll go. Just something you could tell us,
first.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and
Frankie? – Jane sent me a Dumper –</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: Please, if he sees you, he won’t come!</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper,
one of her regular Johns?</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: What about him? Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Did he come around often?</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: No. He was an older man hon. The dumper was
older.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Do you remember his name? What can you tell
me about him?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Arlyn, get them out.</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: Please, I am begging you.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It’s important.</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: That’s not the Dumper, that’s all! He was an
older man!</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Can you give me any more description than
that?</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: Cappy? –</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: It’s all right, they’re all right –</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Cappy? – Cappy?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Cappy it’s all right! I got a radio – don’t
run, don’t –</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: Oh baby – no it’s all right – oh my baby baby
baby –</p>
<p><strong>arlyn</strong>: Get out! Don’t cry my baby; I’ll find him,
I’ll get it. Baby, baby, don’t cry. Leave us alone! Get out and get out
and leave us alone! My honey, my baby, my baby –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: She wouldn’t be reliable anyhow – a narcotics
addict.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I believed her, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: He’s right you know. Waiting for the pusher,
she’d tell you anything.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom
Grunemann.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: All right, suppose it wasn’t Tom Grunemann;
where does that get you?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It’s where it doesn’t get me. I’ve got
nothing left that connects to anything.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Then, close the case.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I better keep looking.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Where, how?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much
more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You just finished telling me she had nothing
to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It’s got to make sense some way.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Cable – they are meeting in
Mr. Camara’s office.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Yes Evvie, thanks. Gentlemen, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: I’m flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday;
I’ll fill them in on things.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: How is it back there?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: I think you’re homesick. I’ll be out at my
camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air,
that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful. John, I’ll be
back here again Thursday; I’ll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: They were bringing a freighter down through
Kill Van Kull; propellers washed it up on top.</p>
<p><strong>sugarman</strong>: Why didn’t you bring it up on deck?</p>
<p><strong>deckhand</strong>: Would you bring it up on deck?</p>
<p><strong>deckhand</strong>: Mickey, get something. Get the eels
off.</p>
<p><strong>spence</strong>: They’ll drop off theirselves when she comes
out.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: It’ll go to the Examiner. But I don’t see
nothin that means nothin.</p>
<p><strong>sugarman</strong>: You help us with ID? We can’t get nothin
from him.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Arlyn Page was probably an alias. She went by
the names Terry Arlyn and June Price. She may have been from Pittsburgh,
someone told me. I can give you a list of people who knew her, if that
would help to –</p>
<p><strong>sugarman</strong>: No point, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Is he claiming the body?</p>
<p><strong>sugarman</strong>: Uh uh, that’d mean funeral expenses.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Man could you help me?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yeah, what?</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: You know, help me out. That’s my baby there,
dead. I got to get up.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Man you don’t know what that does to me, my
baby dead –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: – You’ve got to get up.</p>
<p><strong>berger</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: That’s how the other one died, you know. In
the water.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I looked it up.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Well hello – come on in.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is
dead.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: The same as Jane McKenna.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe
you’d left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from
Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: The next few weeks I would like to know where
you are all the time.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Just let me know when you are going out and
where –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come
along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: How can you do it to yourself?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I don’t get you.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Ligourin: How could you do it?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I told you before, you wouldn’t
understand.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: You’re right, I don’t understand. Explain it
to me. You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should;
that’s death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death.
Ligourin kills women.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No, no you’re right, I’m sorry. He uses
women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Arlyn was a junkie; I’m not on junk!</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No, you can find some other way. Explain it
to me. Bree, show me any sense to –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid
bastard, you don’t know anything, you square, you get out! I don’t have
to show you anything; you get out!</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: If I asked you something, would you not laugh?
– asked you to look at something?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I thought it was maybe changing shape or
something.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look – I hate everybody; and I’m sorry for
everybody; and I’m scared all the time.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look, I don’t know either. It’s like the only
thing I know how to do – I feel safe.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It’s been a full day.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: We did this before.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: No. Well all right. But you want to and I want
you to and we both know it and all right.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I don’t like getting splashed.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: — Bree —</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Go back to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I’m still scared. I mean different but still.
Look, I made it very clear from the start, you’re a yokel, you don’t
excite me, you don’t even interest me, and so I only have one question
which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: My bed.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I am scared. The things I do. The things I
could do to you.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: No, not just ‘mm’. You don’t know what I –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh boy, say, you think you’re pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: The son of a bitch seduced me!</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I know: it’s ridiculous. But it’s tearing me
up and I don’t know why. And look, all right, I came here didn’t I? And
if I have to, I’ll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy
and my daddy and I’ll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God’s
sakes say something?</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: I’d just be guessing.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Guess!</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: Maybe this wasn’t just a trick. Maybe
you’re in danger of real love, real involve –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I do not love him.</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: You’ve spent your life avoiding this.
You’ll try hard to deny it; you’re quite likely to destroy it.</p>
<p><strong>custodian</strong>: Four – five – what number’d I say?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Four ninety-seven, Jane McKenna</p>
<p><strong>custodian</strong>: – And I keep the authorization,
please.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I thought there’d be more.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: All right. Loneliness. Well – separated. From
other people. Forgotten. Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the
motions, right? But the truth is, I don’t belong.</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: Don’t belong?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Do you always have to repeat?</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Well it’s more than loneliness. Hate. People
hating me – and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me – you
know? I’m all screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: You think people hate you.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: The truth is I hate them: they must hate me.
All right, the money. All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It
gets things back together. Well let’s say I’d go to one of these
cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before – before I got this job – and
they’d always say thank you very much and i’d feel, you know, brought
down. They didn’t want me.</p>
<p><strong>spangler</strong>: Didn’t want you.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I said that. Well, so you have a choice. You
can either feel lonely – you know, the hate – or – So you take a call
and go to a hotel room and there’s some John you’ve never seen before,
but he wants you. He must, he’s paying for it. And usually they’re
nervous and that’s all right, too, because you’re not; you know this
thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you’re all
there is. And it’s not real and you don’t have to even like them – you
can even hate them, it’s all right, it safe – you know?</p>
<p><strong>trask’s voice</strong>: All right, there’s Tom Grunemann,
you’re right, different margins, different spacing absolutely, sloppy,
right.</p>
<p><strong>klute’s voice</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>trask’s voice</strong>: All right, try this next guy.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Think this is our guy?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I don’t know. It looks familiar to me.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Thought it might. It’s off an arrest report
you typed two years ago. Man you wanted samples of everybody.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Now the next cat. Mm?</p>
<p><strong>trask’s voice</strong>: Same margins top and sides. He does
best with his middle fingers; you get fainter registration from outside
keys like Q, A, L, P and like that. Next thing look around apostrophes,
how he hits the space bar before –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: But what reason could he have? What possible
reason?</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Unless he was involved with Grunemann’s
disappearance.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I knew Tom never wrote that letter.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: What else do you know?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I never could believe that Tom was a split
personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don’t believe he
disappeared of his own volition; and I don’t believe he’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: We have some very tentative circumstantial
evidence of freeky behavior, but there’s no evidence of murder - there’s
not even a body.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I don’t believe Tom’s alive.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: But why? Why?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yes, Mr. Cable’s office, please.</p>
<p><strong>cable’s voice</strong>: John, how are you?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I’ll be sending you on a report tonight.</p>
<p><strong>cable’s voice</strong>: It’s a beautiful day in Tuscarora - I
don’t envy you that humidity in the city.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It’s not so bad.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Would you like to know what’s in it? The
report.</p>
<p><strong>cable’s voice</strong>: What’s in it?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I think Tom Grunemann’s dead. I’ve been a lot
of places - I’ve asked a lot of people. I’ve found no proof he’s around.
I’ve found no proof he was ever around.</p>
<p><strong>cable voice</strong>: How do you go from that to the idea
Tom’s dead? Suicide you’re suggesting? He killed himself?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: He could’ve been murdered.</p>
<p><strong>cable’s voice</strong>: I’m sure the FBI and the Police
explored that possibility.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No. They never did, really. But that’s what
I’m going to recommend. The next step. Unless something –</p>
<p><strong>cable’s voice</strong>: Have you discussed this with
them?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It’s in the report.</p>
<p><strong>cable’s voice</strong>: Do they have the report? Have you
discussed it with them?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I wanted to give it to you first.</p>
<p><strong>cable’s voice</strong>: All right. All right – John, just sit
tight will you? I’ll read your report, I’ll discuss it with the others.
I’ll be back next Thursday, we’ll talk the whole thing over then.
Nothing til Thursday, all right?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>cable’s voice</strong>: Thank you. Goodbye, John.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Goodbye, Pete.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: He was always at their house on holidays. Tom
and Holly always had him, over on holidays. Tom felt sorry for him - his
whole life was work. Tom felt sorry for him.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I saw Mr. Faber. You remember Mr. Faber, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Is that all you have to say?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: What am I supposed to say?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Well, I told him I wouldn’t - uh - go there
any more. I know it’s tough to understand, but it wasn’t easy. You see,
he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn’t just him. I got something out of it
too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn’t go there anymore.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Well, here’s your gold star.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Spangler says we have a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You and I – a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I was wondering what that was.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Hell there’s nothing so mysterious about the
square life.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Don’t touch anything.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You suppose he’s a married fella?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: He got in my clothing!</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh look what he did in them.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Stay out of there.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Listen to me: It’s all right. I’ve been
expecting something.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: My God, I thought it was over. And here I am,
daddy, right back at the start.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Bree –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Right back at the start, right?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Go down in my room.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You said it was over, right? You said not to
worry any more, all over, right?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Go down in my room and wait.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: But if Cable killed Grunemann why would he get
you hired to look for Grunemann?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Because he knew I couldn’t leave the case
alone. And this way at least he’d keep track of it. And me.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: What about Grunemann’s letters to the girl,
everything like that?</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Cable’s letters, Cable’s phone calls. Cable’s
everything else. He’s been a Dumper a long time. He just passed off his
own peculiar habits on the other man – it kept things goin’.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: OK, pretend I believe you. Tell me how you get
an indictment.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Can’t. Yet. Oh we got everythin’ else: first
rate evidence Cable typed those dumper letters to Bree Daniel. And Jane
McKenna: Klute found a couple in her personal remains. We got dates of
Cable’s trips here coincidin’ with phone calls to Bree Daniel, also the
dates of death of McKenna and Page. We got some hints of his personal
history. His father, unsuccessful salesman, committed suicide when he
was 13. His mother pinned all her hopes on her son. He won a national
science youth award at the age of eight. They had no money, but she
hired special tutors for him in the summer time. She saw a good thing.
He graduated from high school at 14 – college at 16 – no friends – The
kids in his class thought of him as a freak. He got his Ph.D. at 18 –
married at age 21 to his then employer’s daughter. The marriage lasted 4
weeks. Her father had it annulled. She says he was impotent. World War
II he got in bad trouble about a German girl, no details. We think we
know why he killed Grunemann – he found out Cable was a dumper; Cable
couldn’t take that. We think we know why he killed McKenna – she wanted
to blackmail him for it. All fine. But we got no body, no direct
witnesses, we can’t go any-damn-where.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: That’s the reason i told him we had no
evidence Tom was still alive. We wanted to shake him into another phone
call or another letter. It didn’t work out just that way.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Gov, want to leave me that one. How come he
got to play with this one, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I left them here. I was doing some work
here.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: It’s damn lucky you didn’t have the dossier
on Cable here.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Nobody’s seen that.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: If we get anything from the lab, we’ll have
it by noon. And just think – all he really had to do was write us a
letter.</p>
<p><strong>ross</strong>: Sounds to me you better shake him again. Put
him in a spot he has to do something more – but this time give him a
time and a place to do it.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked
me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He’s on his way to
Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: He sure chalks up a lot of flight time.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Ah, Schmendrick – what’s the scam?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Those were police laboratory people, they’ve
been over the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh zippidy-doo, they’ll find my fingerprints.
Can I go in? I need some stuff.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Where’d you spend last night?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: With Trina.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I called Trina.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Maybe I wasn’t there when you called.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Bree, what’s actually happened? It wasn’t
that bad.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: How do you know how bad it was?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Why couldn’t you stay here with me?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Because I didn’t want to be touched! I didn’t
think you’d get that!</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Trask wants to talk with you.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Hey – look officer – I can explain everything.
It was just – you know, everything all of a –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Trask wants to talk with you.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Miss Daniel, be sensible, you find another
place till we get things cleaned up.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh well that shouldn’t take you more than
another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: A few more days. We know who did this.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: No, not Grunemann. He’s dead. The man that
killed him – also prob’ly Jane McKenna, also Arlyn Page.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they
commited suicide.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Now there’s a picture I’d like you to –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You said someone killed them, you said you
know who, you said that.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Well we’re pretty –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Why isn’t he locked up?</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: We don’t want to just lock him up; we want a
conviction, we wanted him to do something more.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Is that why Klute didn’t tell me?</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: I guess he figured it was better.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What was better? I made better bait?</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: No, that’s not –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Is that what he set me up for? Everything he’s
told me from the beginning? – don’t worry, don’t –</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: From the beginning I don’t know why the hell
he’s messin with you. If he was me he’d know better. If he was even a
city boy he’d know better. You’re a whore Miss Daniel, that’s the truth
of it, right? Now somethin I’d like you to look at.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I don’t have to look at anything. I don’t have
–</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Here please.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh no.</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: Like for you to look for the man.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Grunemann? I’ve looked at him a –</p>
<p><strong>trask</strong>: No. Not Grunemann. The Dumper. Just look
around – I said look for the Dumper.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh! –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Sorry we had to meet here. But I’m pressed
for time.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Well there’s a couple –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: I read your report. I had to go along with it
– the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around
–</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Well as a matter of –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: I’ve been up country, you know my summer
place, my camp. I don’t even have a telephone there. This morning they
sent a messenger out, that you’d been trying to call me.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: I’m on my way to Chicago. Very important
meeting tonight. Well – any new developments?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yeah, two things Pete, that –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You said Trask was arranging laboratory work.
Police laboratory. Anything from that?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yeah. It wasn’t Tom.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It wasn’t Tom that broke in the room.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his
own pictures, he –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of
souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood
group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Some mistake perhaps that –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No. No mistake Pete. It doesn’t prove who it
was – but proves it wasn’t Tom.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You must be discouraged.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in
the picture.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: That who?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and
Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You said he was no possible connection with
Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Someone’s been doing all these things.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You were hired to look for Tom, not
someone.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Pete, I’ve got a chance to buy Jane McKenna’s
black book.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a
list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she’ll even sell it
worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was
stolen. I’ve been after it a long time.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You were hired to look for Tom.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I’m meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to
meet me on East-River Drive – he wants five hundred dollars for the
book. Can you get that for me Pete?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: I can’t follow you.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Will the Company put up five hundred dollars
to get Jane McKenna’s list of clients?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: No. It’s ridiculous. This has nothing to do
with Tom Grunemann.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: It probably has the Dumper’s name. It might
give us some kind of new lead. I want a look at it anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Klute, the Company’s interest is Tom
Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can’t find Tom; all
right, I’ll see that you’re paid off; the case is closed.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: All right, but I’m going to see that
list.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Why would they deal with you? You don’t know
these people.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No, but Bree does. She’s negotiating for me.
Bree Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: I can talk it over; possibly I can get the
money. When are you meeting the man?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and
73rd Street.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Suppose I meet you there a half hour
before.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Just send me a money order.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: No, I’d – like to be in on it.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Bree?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I’m always getting surprises.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I don’t want you to do this.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Please. I said I don’t want you to do
this.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Trask said I should move. Let’s not make a
thing of it.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look, too much is going on here. I’m moving in
with another girl, that’s all. Just for a while.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s right. This other girl’s got a very
big apartment, big, plenty of room. Look, it’s not necessarily how it
looks, right? It’s –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No. Please. Not with this son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Klute, let’s handle it like grownups? I mean
we’re all grown up now, right? – we all respect each other, you know
what I mean? – I respect you, Bree respects you – you could say, it just
didn’t work out between you and she. But you got to respect her too –
you know, her best interests, best for her –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey, I’m gonna get you dropped.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Please –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – until he gets back. Yes I heard you, I
understand that. I said I’m going to come over, I’ll wait until he gets
back.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Hello? Trask, I don’t get that.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Who told you, his secretary? Has someone
checked his hotel? He always stays at the – I’ll look around, I’ll call
you back.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Bree –</p>
<p><strong>lela</strong>: Mrs. Daniel –</p>
<p><strong>lela</strong>: – I have to close up now. Leave your name and
number with his message service, Mrs. Daniel, and why don’t you just go
home and wait until he –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lela</strong>: Well I have to close up now.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look – could I use your phone?</p>
<p><strong>lela</strong>: Yes indeed.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look. I almost killed my – I almost killed
someone.</p>
<p><strong>lela</strong>: Well I’m certain Doctor Spangler will want to
talk with you; excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Is Mr. Faber there? Mr. Faber Senior.</p>
<p><strong>faber</strong>: Yes? Bree?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – I’m – I just have to talk to someone. I’m
just a little way across town –</p>
<p><strong>faber</strong>: Yes - yes dear, yes – maybe half an hour,
sure, yes.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Trina, will you call me if you hear from,
her? Will you check other people she might call? Yeah, if it wasn’t
trouble I wouldn’t ask vou.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yeah? Nothing yet, Trask; I’m going down the
list. I’ve tried Spangler’s office and Spangler’s home; I just get his
message service. I’ll keep– I may have steered Cable that way. I told
him Bree was dealing for me, for Jane McKenna’s book. Have you found any
–</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Lady, it’s closing up there.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: We’re closing up, quitting time,
Fabers.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I have an appointment with Mr. Faber.</p>
<p><strong>foreman</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I have an appointment with Mr. Faber.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: In there. Mr. Faber –</p>
<p>****: Mr. Faber –</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I’m sorry – Mr. Faber Senior.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: My father went home about fifteen minutes
ago; he wasn’t feeling too good.</p>
<p><strong>nathan</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: It wasn’t important.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Did Mr. Faber leave a message for me or
anything? Mr. Faber Senior? Bree Daniel.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Oh, I thought that was for
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Bree Daniel. Has he called in yet? Well if he
does, I’m at – – two seven eight, three one hundred, and I guess I can
wait here five minutes; then I’ll try from somewhere else. Just tell him
Bree Daniel; he knows who.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Mr. Faber, I just wanted to leave this for
your father, and I wondered if you’d –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Someone –</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Did she leave a number? This is a police
call; don’t make me take time to prove it. Did she leave a number? What
is the number? What is the number? –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Can’t we talk together reasonably, just –
ordinarily? I know you’re expecting some kind of – extravagant behavior,
but believe me – do you believe me? –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Yes – all right –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: – We can talk –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: – Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: All right, then, an ordinary matter. I’m a
quite well off man, I have a – position to respect. I would feel
personally uncomfortable to be connected with a – certain kind of woman,
I’m sure you understand. Do you? Well I’d like to buy Jane McKenna’s
book.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Her black book, Jane McKenna’s, her list of –
of persons. I was told you’re negotiating for it on behalf of –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: That was what Klute told me – you were
negotiating for him to buy that list. And I’m in a position to pay a
good deal more for it than he can. Do you understand? I’d like you to
acquire it on my – Miss Daniel, do you not understand? Miss Daniel, I
can’t tell whether you understand me. Is this something Klute just
invented? Is this a trap for me, Miss Daniel; does Klute know about
me?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You have no idea what I’m talking about.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Yes – Jane McKenna’s book – I could make a
phone call.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: No, you’re frightened, you’re pretending.
Well – Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Then it doesn’t matter what I do any more,
does it?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You people know nothing about pain.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: I’ve got no idea what I shall do.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you, absolutely, I’m
not.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Will you let me go then?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: It puzzles me so badly. I’ve done terrible
things but I can’t consider myself a terrible man. I’ve killed three
people and I’d still want to say it was accident, do you see?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: If you’ll let me go I could tell them what
–</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Tom Grunemann discovered me – we were here on
business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it
was the – the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner
or later he’d use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as
long as I could, do you see?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m just frightened. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Excuse me Miss Daniel?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I said yes, I see.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Oh no, I don’t think –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Tell me. I’ll listen. I just want you to tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You’re willing to listen? You want me just to
keep talking?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: That’s what you do, isn’t it; you make a man
feel accepted. That’s what you all do. Your stock in trade a man’s
weakness.</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: Why don’t you ask for mercy? My God, what
mercy has anyone given me?</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: You’re a person of no value, you have no
value –</p>
<p><strong>cable</strong>: – Is that contempt? Is it? No, I’m the one
who feels contempt.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Come on. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable
owned a plot of woodland – he’d go there on weekends. They found Tom
Grunemann’s body buried there. They’ve notified his wife.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh. Well it wasn’t us city people that did it
– your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You’re going back?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Wait.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Well suppose I hadn’t come downstairs. Would
you just have folded up and sneaked away?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask
you to marry me.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You wanted to, or you are?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I am.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You could at least look at me!</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look – yes. I mean thanks, but – don’t you
think we better be realistic?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look at me. I’m pretty and sort of clever and
very well intentioned, and dear God I’d tear your heart out!</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: I don’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: How can you not think so? You know the things
I can do.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: They don’t scare me any more.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Doesn’t scare me. I think we could handle
it.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Please, I’m a city person. I’m sure it’s just
as good as here but I’m a city person, that’s all, I am! Hell I know
what it’s like. I was in Jersey once: the frogs go bra-a p all night!
What’im I supposed to do? Mend your socks and sing in the church choir?
Do you not believe I love you? I’m honestly, honestly just –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Look, why should it be yes or no? Can’t we
keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other
and see. People do that, that’s realistic.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: You don’t believe that either, do you? Why
can’t you see my side?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Can you use these?</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Can I carry something for you, to the car?
Will you kiss me?</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: No. I’m sore.</p>
<p><strong>klute</strong>: Well –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: Oh heck – Oh heck –</p>
<p><strong>bree</strong>: I haven’t decided yet! I haven’t decided yet!
I haven’t decided yet! –</p>
