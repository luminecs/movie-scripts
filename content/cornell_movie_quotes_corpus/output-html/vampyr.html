<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Hello, you there!</p>
<p><strong>child’s voice</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: I’ll come down and open the door.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Good night, sir!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Good night!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Oh, why did he have to die - why
should I have to lose him … why, why?</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Don’t cry!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: My little boy, my little boy!</p>
<p><strong>woman’s voice</strong>: Oh God, oh God!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Are you asleep?</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Wake up!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Who are you!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Sh!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: She mustn’t die … do you hear? … She’s dying,
she’s dying!</p>
<p><strong>blind woman</strong>: Who’s there?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Is there anybody here?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Good evening!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: I…</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: Sh!!!</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: Did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Yes, the child …</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: The child!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: There’s no child here.</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: But … the dogs…</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: There’s no child here, and no dogs either.</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: No! Good night!</p>
<p><strong>the interior of the castle</strong>: Bernard enters a room
arranged as a sick-room. A woman is lying there in bed; it is his
daughter, whose name is L�one. A nurse is looking after her. L�one is a
woman of twenty-six. She is very pale, as if suffering from anemia.
Bernard goes up to the bed. The nurse stands beside him and says:</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The wounds are nearly healed!</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: The blood! … The blood! …</p>
<p><strong>bernard</strong>: You mustn’t lie down and go to sleep until
the doctor has been here!</p>
<p><strong>the castle</strong>: L�one’s sick-room. The nurse puts a
chair by the bed.</p>
<p><strong>the park of the castle</strong>: Nikolas jumps up on the wall
ringing the castle. When he appears on the wall, his body forms a
ghostly silhouette against the night sky .</p>
<p><strong>the courtyard</strong>: The three shadows emerge from the
shadow of the trees, steal across the moonlit courtyard and disappear
into the deep shadows of the castle.</p>
<p><strong>the castle</strong>: Bernard in the corridor, outside the
door of his room. He still has the lamp in his hand. He goes into his
room.</p>
<p><strong>the courtyard</strong>: Enter Nikolas . He finds himself
under the room that Bernard has just entered. Through the lighted window
he sees Bernard putting down his lamp and recognizes him as the man who
visited him in his dreams. At the same moment he sees the three shadows
going diagonally across the ceiling of the room; at that moment Bernard
leaves the window and goes across to a bookshelf. Nikolas rushes to the
main door of the castle. He rings vigorously at the door. The bell gives
a feeble ring. The echo dies away, and everything is quiet again.
Nikolas rings again. Now he hears behind the door an old person’s
shuffling steps. He tugs at the door and shouts:</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Open up … open up quickly … hurry!</p>
<p><strong>a voice</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: For God’s sake … hurry .. . they’re killing
him!</p>
<p><strong>the staircase landing outside l�one’s room</strong>: The
nurse opens the door in terror. Her facial contortions show that the
invalid has heard nothing, but that on the other hand she dare not leave
her either.</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: This adjoins Bernard’s room. The
manservant and Nikolas try to open the door into Bernard’s room, but the
body of the dying man is lying just behind the door, preventing them
from opening it more than a few inches. The dying man’s screams fill
them with horror.</p>
<p><strong>manservant</strong>: The other door!</p>
<p><strong>bernard</strong>: Water!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Wasn’t it her?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: No, it’s down there.</p>
<p><strong>bernard’s room</strong>: Enter Gis�le. She stops dead by the
door, paralyzed by the sight of her father lying on the point of death.
She looks at the chamber-maid and the old housekeeper, who are clinging
to each other, while the tears run down their cheeks. Beside herself,
and with eyes dilated with terror, she goes to her father and kneels by
his side. He understands that she is there. His face lights up for a
moment, after which he closes his eyes again for a while, as if trying
to draw breath for the few words he wants to say; but he has not
sufficient strength left. He uses his last ounce of strength to draw a
ring from his finger. He hands the ring to Gis�le, who recognizes it. It
is a signet ring, the signet of which is formed like a tiny gold cross.
She holds it in the hollow of her hand, while her eyes fill with tears.
The dying man catches Gis�le’s eye and, as it were, guides it over to
Nikolas as if to say: ‘This man will protect you.’ His gaze becomes
vacant, without consciousness, fixed and glassy. His breathing comes in
jerks. Nikolas tries to moisten his lips but the liquid runs down his
chin and thence onto his breast. His teeth are firmly clenched, and the
corners of his mouth are sagging. The brief death-struggle has begun.
While we see the little group by the door, which has been joined by the
old coachman, we hear the dying man’s death-rattle. Tears run down the
coachman’s furrowed cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>on the landing</strong>: The nurse is still standing there.
The death-rattle reaches her ears. She goes into L�one’s room and shuts
the door behind her.</p>
<p><strong>bernard’s room</strong>: Here the silence of death prevails.
The group by the door follows with bated breath the last spasms of the
death-struggle. Now the murdered lord of the castle is drawing his last
gasp. The old housekeeper goes up to Gis�le, who is no longer weeping
but merely stares uncomprehendingly at her father’s lifeless body. The
old housekeeper calls to her gently. Gis�le looks at her in
surprise.</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>the courtyard</strong>: The coachman crosses the courtyard,
opens the door of the carriage entrance, and draws out a hunting
carriage. He pulls it slowly and carefully, as if wanting to muffle the
sound.</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: The old housekeeper has gone on
ahead in order to light a lamp. Nikolas gets Gis�le to sit down. Her
gaze is vacant, and the only sound that comes from her is a suppressed
sobbing.</p>
<p><strong>housekeeper</strong>: Couldn’t you stay here … until …</p>
<p><strong>the courtyard</strong>: The coachman leads a horse from the
stable.</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Nikolas stops in front of Gis�le’s
chair and looks compassionately at her. She is sitting as motionless as
a stone. Only her lips are trembling, as if she is praying quietly.
Suddenly she senses his presence. She looks up at him imploringly and
says in a voice choked with tears:</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: It’s so dark here!</p>
<p><strong>the courtyard</strong>: The coachman is hitching the
horses.</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Nikolas lights another lamp, and
as he puts out the match he looks at Gis�le. She is sitting with her
hands in her lap, rocking her head backwards and forwards. Her eyes are
glazed. She is doing all she can to prevent herself from breaking down
completely, but when the first tears trickle down her cheeks she breaks
into sobs. She lifts her clenched hands to her eyes and weeps. Nikolas
goes over to her. He knows that he can do absolutely nothing, however
much he wants to quench her sorrow. He bends over her, as if wanting to
speak the words of consolation that she needs, but before he can say
anything she bursts out:</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: How can anyone endure to live here?</p>
<p><strong>the courtyard</strong>: The coachman is putting on his cloak;
he sits up and drives the carriage out.</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Gis�le jumps up at the sound of
the carriage. In her anxious and overwrought condition she endows every
sound with meaning. She goes to the window, looks out and asks:</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Where is he going?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: To fetch the police!</p>
<p><strong>l�one’s room</strong>: L�one is lying in bed. The nurse is
sitting in the room with her sewing things. Suddenly she raises her
eyes. A number of little furrows have appeared on L�one’s forehead. Her
breathing becomes irregular and labored. Her face is twisted, as if she
is tormented by fear and uncertainty. She opens her eyes, and her gaze
is fixed and distant, as if held by someone a long way away. She looks
like a medium under hypnosis. She is visibly no longer master of her own
will, or she is under the influence of a power stronger than her own. In
spite of her weakened condition she raises herself on her elbow and
shouts very loudly:</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: Yes … yes!</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: Yes … I’m coming!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: You’re dreaming … you’re dreaming!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What were you dreaming about?</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: A voice …</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: That spoke to you?</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: That called … commanded …</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What did it say?</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Gis�le at the window with her
forehead pressed against the cold pane. Nikolas is sitting reading the
book.</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: L�one …</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Look! … Look! … There, in the park!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Take the lantern!</p>
<p><strong>the park</strong>: By the time they are out there, L�one is
nowhere to be seen. They begin a thorough search of the park, which
looks ghostly with its moonlit sandstone statues. Some of the tree
trunks are painted white. They look like skeletons, swaying backwards
and forwards. Spiders’ webs shine like silver. From time to time a bird
flies off in alarm. We begin by following the manservant, as he makes
his way through bushes and undergrowth with the lantern held high over
his head like a luminous hour-glass. With his free hand he holds his
jacket tightly round his neck. In the distance we hear Gis�le shouting
anxiously:</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: L�one! … L�one!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: L�one! L�one!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: But it’s me … Gis�le!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Don’t wake her!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Look … blood! …</p>
<p><strong>l�one’s room</strong>: The manservant has laid L�one on the
bed and now goes out. The nurse settles L�one and discovers the wound in
her throat; she takes a wad of cotton-wool, moistens it with a
disinfectant rinse from a bottle, and dabs the liquid on the wound.
L�one shudders convulsively, puts her hand on the wound and groans. The
nurse goes out.</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: L�one! … L�one …</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Why are you crying?</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: I wish I was dead!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: No, no … L�one!</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: Yes, yes, yes … I am lost … I am sinking
deeper and deeper into the darkness … I am afraid … I am afraid! …</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: Where is … ?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Your father?</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: The master … is asleep!</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Nikolas is there with the old
housekeeper, who with old-world courtesy brings him a cup of strong
coffee. Just as she is handing Nikolas the cup, Gis�le comes in. With a
distracted expression she shuts the door mechanically and goes and sits
down. The old housekeeper puts the other cup down beside Gis�le, who is
completely absorbed by her recent strange experience. The other two look
at her enquiringly.</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: I think L�one is dying!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Didn’t you hear something?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: You’re tired!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Oh, the silence!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: I’ll try to get a little sleep!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: You’re not leaving us, I hope?</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Play something more!</p>
<p><strong>manservant</strong>: The police are here.</p>
<p><strong>the courtyard</strong>: The two men emerge from the house and
stand at the head of the steps. The carriage drives up the last few
yards. The horse walks as if sunk in its own thoughts; then it stops
abruptly. Joseph takes the lantern, which has been left on the steps,
and slowly approaches the carriage. After a few paces he stops. Now he
can see the whole carriage clearly and the coachman is alone.</p>
<p><strong>manservant</strong>: Are you alone?</p>
<p><strong>manservant</strong>: Are you alone?</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Enter Nikolas. He shuts the door
very quietly behind him as if afraid that by making the slightest noise
he will bring about still worse misfortunes. He tiptoes to the piano and
extinguishes the two lights on it. As he is doing this, he cocks an ear
to listen for Gis�le’s breathing; then he resumes his reading of the
diary, a page of which is shown. As he reads we hear in the distance the
sound of horses’ hooves on the paving stones … also the sound of the
carriage being put away. Then silence reigns again around the old house.
Nikolas listens out into the silence. Is he awake, or are all these
fearful happenings merely a long, horrible nightmare? The heart of the
old clock is still beating. After a moment a deep sigh is heard from a
corner of the room. Nikolas looks in that direction. A cello is standing
there. One of the strings has slipped, and as he looks at it another
string breaks. Then silence again wraps its mantle round the room.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: How is she?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Was she alone, then?</p>
<p><strong>manservant</strong>: Yes, just for a moment.</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Good evening!</p>
<p><strong>doctor [marc]</strong>: Good evening!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Let’s go try … it’s high time …</p>
<p><strong>the sick-room</strong>: The doctor hurries in and goes
straight to the bed. The nurse’s face takes on an expression of fear.
She is giving the patient camphor. L�one is paler than before. Her
features are hard and sharp, her lips blue. It is painful to see her and
hear her breathing. Beside herself, the nurse turns to the doctor and
says:</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: It’s going very badly!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Her pulse?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Very weak!</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Is she dying?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Perhaps we could save her …</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Will you give her blood?</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Immediately … this very moment!</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Joseph goes to the door of the
room where Gis�le is. His face shows surprise when he discovers Gis�le
on the sofa; she is sitting motionless, with her legs drawn up under her
and her head leaning back against the wall, staring fixedly at him with
wide-open, startled eyes. As if talking to herself, she says:</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Why does the doctor always come at
night?</p>
<p><strong>the sick-room</strong>: By the time we return there, all the
preparations for the blood transfusion are completed.</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Joseph returns from the room where
Gis�le is. He has evidently succeeded in calming her. He goes and sits
in the chair where Nikolas sat. He rests his head in his hand. He sees
the open diary and begins reading it.</p>
<p><strong>the sick-room</strong>: The blood transfusion is now in
progress. The only words are curt orders like: ‘Now! - Quickly! - That’s
enough! - Give it to me! - Sit still!’ etc.</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Joseph is reading the diary, which
arouses his interest more and more. It is as if he finds a connection
between what he reads and the fearful events that have taken place
around him. An extract from the diary is shown.</p>
<p><strong>the sick-room</strong>: The blood transfusion continues. Marc
has positioned himself outside the circle of light from the lamp, so
that he can see Nikolas in bright light, while he himself sits in the
dark. Nikolas watches L�one’s face anxiously and closely during her
struggle with death. Life slowly seems to return to her, and her
breathing becomes more peaceful. She opens her eyes and looks at the
people round her, but she is much too enfeebled to speak, and closes her
eyes again. Marc keeps a close watch on Nikolas, who grows paler and
paler. His eyes swivel slowly from Nikolas to the patient and back to
Nikolas again.</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Another fragment of the diary is
shown .</p>
<p><strong>the sick-room</strong>: The blood transfusion is completed.
While Marc himself is looking after the patient, the nurse leads Nikolas
into an adjoining room, where she makes him sit down and prepares his
bandage. The doctor stands bending over L�one.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Is he in a bad way?</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: Yes, rather.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Give him a tablet!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You can lie down now and sleep. I’ll keep
watch!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Did you hear what I said?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Doctor, doctor!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: The wound is bleeding!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Go to sleep!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You are suffering … you are tired … come
with me … we shall become one … bodies, souls, blood … there is only one
way of escaping from your suffering and finding peace … follow me … you
will not be freed until you have taken your own life … come … I am
waiting for you …</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Doctor!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: What is it now?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: I’m losing my blood!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: You’re losing your blood?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Nonsense! … It’s here! … Your blood …</p>
<p><strong>the drawing-room</strong>: Here the old manservant is
sitting, completely absorbed in the diary. Suddenly he raises his head,
as if he has heard a sound. He starts to his feet, with an overwhelming
sense of dread and foreboding. He is filled with a presentiment of some
horror or other. He goes to the window and sees on the paving stones the
shadow of a window on the first floor. There is a light behind the
window and the light is moving. He goes cautiously into the hall. When
he has climbed a few steps of the staircase he can see Marc in the
window. In his hand he is holding a lamp which he moves backwards and
forwards several times. The manservant stands there motionless and with
bated breath …</p>
<p><strong>manservant</strong>: Stay here!</p>
<p><strong>l�one’s room</strong>: The nurse stands leaning over L�one.
It is evident that the patient’s strength is ebbing away. The nurse and
the manservant are aware that everything will soon be over. L�one
realizes it herself. She moans, sobs and wails. The nurse consoles her
as best she can. As for the manservant, he appears to be maturing in his
mind some great project or other. L�one, who has great difficulty in
getting the words out, says:</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: I am damned … oh God, oh my God!</p>
<p><strong>manservant</strong>: She must not die now … you must keep her
alive until morning comes …</p>
<p><strong>manservant</strong>: God help me!</p>
<p><strong>the wood</strong>: Nikolas is running in the direction of the
factory.</p>
<p><strong>the castle</strong>: The manservant comes pushing a
wheelbarrow and stops in front of a tool-shed, from which by the light
of a lantern he takes a pick-axe and a shovel; he puts these in the
wheelbarrow. He is just about to go when he realizes that he has
forgotten something. He goes back into the shed and takes a long crowbar
and a wooden mallet. These objects likewise he puts in the wheelbarrow,
fastens the lantern on the handle of the wheelbarrow, and sets off.</p>
<p><strong>a field</strong>: Nikolas enters at a run and suddenly falls
headlong.</p>
<p><strong>outside the churchyard</strong>: The manservant pushes his
wheelbarrow along the wall. He makes for the churchyard gate.</p>
<p><strong>a field</strong>: Nikolas is lying on the spot where he fell.
Suddenly his body divides in two. One part remains lying unconscious,
while the other gets up with evident difficulty. He slowly comes to and
looks round in amazement. Not far off he notices an object on the
ground. It is Gis�le’s ring - the ring with the cross which her father
gave her. He picks it up and examines it carefully, as if Gis�le has
sent him a message by means of the ring; he looks round in the hope of
finding a clue which direction to go in order to find her again. Then he
discovers some footsteps in the sandy earth, looking as if they have
just been made before his very eyes by a pair of invisible feet -
Gis�le’s feet. He gets up and follows these footsteps. They lead him
to</p>
<p><strong>the blind woman’s house</strong>: He goes in at the door,
which opens easily, and finds himself in a dark yard at the back of the
house. He gropes his way forward in the shadow of the house, until he
finds a door without a handle. He opens this in turn. He now finds
himself in the old laundry room, which he recognizes from his previous
visit. From here he knows the way into the house and goes straight to
the door at the other end of the laundry room. He enters the empty room
adjoining it. Here everything is as he last saw it. His own footsteps
are clearly visible in the dust on the floor; nobody has been here. He
listens. Not a sound in the house. He looks for the door into the room
where the coffin stood before. It is locked. So something has happened
since his last visit. He tries hard to open the door, but in vain.</p>
<p><strong>[nikolas’ new pov - from inside the coffin]</strong>: The lid
of the coffin has a square pane of glass just over the dead man’s
face.</p>
<p><strong>the field</strong>: Nikolas is lying on the ground, as when
we last saw him. He begins to return to consciousness. The dream he has
just had enters his semi- consciousness. He opens his eyes a fraction,
as if drowned in sleep, and sees the procession from his dream - at
first making straight for him, but presently turning away. He turns to
watch it, and discovers that he is lying on the ground outside the
churchyard. The funeral procession is making for the churchyard.</p>
<p><strong>the entrance to the churchyard</strong>: and looks in. There
he sees the old manservant, who is pushing away a large flat stone from
over a grave. The coffin in the grave is revealed. It is an old, rotten
coffin. The manservant now throws away his shovel, and uses his pick-axe
to try and get the lid off. Nikolas has caught up with him. The two men
exchange meaningful nods. Then Nikolas jumps down in the grave to help
the manservant.</p>
<p><strong>l�one’s room</strong>: The dying L�one wakes up with a start.
Her great eyes stare up at the ceiling, and her face expresses
unspeakable and speechless astonishment. The nurse bends over her and
asks:</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What is it you can see?</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: Now death is coming for me … I shall not
suffer any more!</p>
<p><strong>the churchyard</strong>: Nikolas and the manservant have
succeeded in getting the lid off the coffin. They look with horror at
the sight that meets their eyes. In the coffin is lying the old blind
woman. Her face is completely untouched, as if she is still alive. She
is preternaturally pale and sallow. Neither her breathing nor her
heartbeat can be heard. Nikolas looks at her by the light of the
lantern.</p>
<p><strong>l�one’s room</strong>: L�one looks like somebody waiting and
listening. The nurse again bends over her and asks:</p>
<p><strong>nurse</strong>: What do you hear?</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: My father … is calling for me! …</p>
<p><strong>the churchyard</strong>: The manservant gives the crowbar to
Nikolas and himself takes the mallet. Nikolas lifts the crowbar and
directs the point at the blind woman’s heart. He raises and lowers the
crowbar several times in order to take careful aim. Then he lifts it
and, turning his face away, plunges it with all his strength into her
heart. Nikolas signals to the manservant, who comes up and hammers the
crowbar further and further in with the mallet. They both look very
serious. Blow after blow echoes around. As soon as the crowbar is
hammered home the two men break off from their work and take a step
back. They stare down at the grave in consternation. The blind woman’s
body has disappeared, and in the place where she lay there is now only a
bare white skeleton.</p>
<p><strong>l�one’s room</strong>: L�one as before. The tension and
suffering seem to have gone from her face. Staring straight ahead, she
whispers as if in a trance:</p>
<p><strong>l�one</strong>: Now I feel strong … my soul is free!</p>
<p><strong>the churchyard</strong>: The gravestone is being pushed back
into place. In this shot we see only the coffin, the gravestone and the
manservant’s hands at work.</p>
<p><strong>the blind woman’s house</strong>: There is a fire in the
grate. Marc is lighting another cigar. The man with the wooden leg
brings him a cup of coffee. Marc brushes some ash from his trousers and
takes a gulp of coffee. Suddenly he raises his head and looks towards
the window. The man with the wooden leg observes his movements and goes
up to him. They both look at the window, where a face now comes into
view. It is Bernard, the man who was murdered at the castle earlier in
the night under such mysterious circumstances. The face moves and looks
in anxiously, while Bernard’s hands protect his eyes against the
moonlight. The two men in the room are seized with terror. Marc bends
forward, and hastily puts out the light, at the same time signaling to
the man with the wooden leg to put out the fire in the grate. The latter
pours water over the fire, which gives out a hissing cloud of steam.</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: Go and see the door is properly shut!</p>
<p><strong>marc</strong>: Oh! Oh! Oh!</p>
<p><strong>the churchyard</strong>: The manservant has tidied up the
grave and is now putting back the tombstone, on which can be read the
following curious inscription: Here lies Marguerite Chopin, born 4
February 1809, died 13 June 1867. Then a catalogue of her virtues.</p>
<p><strong>the blind woman’s house</strong>: We see Nikolas’s hand
inserting the key in the door guarding Gis�le. He finds it behind the
piece of furniture where it is hidden, and inserts it in the lock. The
shot is taken in such a way that the spectator is uncertain whether the
hand is real or not.</p>
<p><strong>rolling countryside</strong>: Marc is running at full speed
like a man pursued. He keeps turning round, as if expecting to see his
pursuer at every moment.</p>
<p><strong>the blind woman’s house</strong>: Gis�le is lying on her bed,
leaning against the wall, with her legs drawn up under her. Her hands
are tied behind her back. Nikolas’s hands appear on the screen
attempting to loosen her bonds. When the knot refuses to yield, he uses
his teeth. Both the hands and Nikolas’s profile are taken as in the
previous shot, i.e., in such a way that the spectator is uncertain
whether they are real or not.</p>
<p><strong>rolling countryside</strong>: Marc is running away like a man
who has lost his reason. Where he is running there is no road or
path.</p>
<p><strong>l�one’s room</strong>: L�one is at the point of death. She is
quite calm. An angelic beauty suffuses her face. She smiles. Then she
slowly closes her eyes. She gives a deep sigh, like a child just before
it falls asleep. She has expired. A hand lays a little gold crucifix on
her closed lips.</p>
<p><strong>[rolling countryside]</strong>: Marc has run right across the
fields, still pursued by his invisible pursuer. Suddenly he is enveloped
in mist. It is like steam rising from the earth. The mist gives
everything a ghostly appearance. Marc is seized with terror. He does not
know where he is. He can neither see nor hear. He is so confused and
agitated that he does not know which way to take. He runs first in one
direction, then in another, tries to retrace his steps, but is unable to
see them because of the mist. He runs in a more and more random manner.
He stops for a moment. Then he sees, a short distance away, a light,
which seems to come from a lantern, and the faint outlines of a gray
shadow, which might be the shadow of a man. He calls, but instead of
answering the shadow merely moves away from him. He runs in pursuit of
it; but in spite of all his exertions the distance between them remains
the same. Speechless with terror, he pursues his frenzied course with
his hands spread out in front of him, as if trying to scatter the
mist.</p>
<p><strong>the river</strong>: Cross-cutting with the scenes described
above recording Marc’s death are scenes showing Nikolas and Gis�le on
their way down to the river. When they reach the bank, they find it
veiled in a white mist so thick as almost to blot out the opposite bank.
A boat is lying right at their feet. They jump down in it, and Nikolas
seizes the oars and starts rowing. When he has taken a few pulls out
into the river, the mist grows thicker; but he continues to row. Now
they cannot even see the bank they have just left. Gis�le stares
anxiously around, and Nikolas rests on the oars to get his bearings. But
they see that they are completely enveloped in mist. They are somewhat
uneasy and confused. Nikolas puts his hands up to his mouth as a
megaphone and calls:</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Hullo!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas and gis�le</strong>: Hullo!</p>
<p><strong>the voice</strong>: Hullo!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: We’re completely lost!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Where are we?</p>
<p><strong>the voice</strong>: This way!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Do you think it’s that way?</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Hullo!</p>
<p><strong>the voice</strong>: Hullo!</p>
<p><strong>the voice</strong>: … This way!</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>the voice</strong>: Wait … we … will … light … a … fire!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Good!</p>
<p><strong>nikolas</strong>: Hullo!</p>
<p><strong>ferryman</strong>: Can you see there?</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>ferryman</strong>: Can you see the fire?</p>
<p><strong>gis�le</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>ferryman</strong>: Sing, children!</p>
