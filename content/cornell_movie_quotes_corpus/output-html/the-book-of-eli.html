<h1 id="the-book-of-eli">the-book-of-eli</h1>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Dear Lord, thank you for your generosity in
providing us today with this bountiful feast.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Thank you for the many gifts that you have
given me. Thank you for your protection and your guidance. Thank you for
bringing me this far. I know my long journey’s end is near. I ask now
only for the strength and the courage to complete the task that you in
your infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow upon me over all men. I won’t let
you down. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Hey. You hungry?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Come on now.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Oh. Please don’t hurt me. Here, take
anything you want. You want some food? Take it.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m not going to hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: That’s what the last guys said.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Could you help me? The wheel came off.
I can’t fix it. Maybe if I could get it out of the ditch. But I
can’t.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: One good thing about no soap any more. You can
smell the road agents a mile off.</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: What you got there in the pack?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: Yeah, that’s what they all say. How
about you take it off real slow and tip it out so’s we can take a
look?</p>
<p><strong>bandit #2</strong>: He’s got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: Shit, it ain’t loaded. They never
are. Ain’t that right, old man?</p>
<p>****: Open the fucking pack or die.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: Want us to do it for you? We can get
it off real easy after we’ve hacked your fucking arms off.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s real important you boys listen to me and
understand. The man I work for, you do not want to cross him. See, I’m
under his protection. You stand in my way, you stand in his. And he will
cut you down with a righteous fury - through me. For I am his faithful
instrument.</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: What the hell are you, some kinda
preacher?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: Well I got news for you, preacher
man. Whatever kinda God you reckon yourself to be working for, he left
these parts a long time ago. He ain’t here to protect your ass. Now take
off the pack and set it on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: You fucking listening to me?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I hear you. You lay that hand on me again and
you will not get it back.</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: All right, I had just about enough of
this shit…</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: What… you just… he just cut my
fucking hand off! My fucking hand!</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: What you standin’ around for? Kiss
him!</p>
<p><strong>bandit #3</strong>: What’s he talkin’ about, kiss him?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: He’s in shock. He means “kill him”.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I told you you wouldn’t be getting that
back.</p>
<p><strong>bandit leader</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: My name is Eli.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Take it and go on your way. And don’t fall in
with men like these again. No good can come.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: God, the father of mercies, through the death
and resurrection of his son has reconciled the world to himself and sent
the holy spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Through the ministry of the church may he give
you pardon and peace, and I absolve you from your sins in the name of
the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Thank you. You’re… a good man.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: There are no good men on the road.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: West.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Can… can I come with you?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It ain’t your concern. Stay on the path. It
ain’t your concern. Stay on the path.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You got an engineer or a fuelman around
here?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>chain gang boss</strong>: Come on, move it!</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m not from around here.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: No shit. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m just a customer.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: A customer with a shotgun?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: You come in here to rip me off?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No. I’ll set it down. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Slowly!</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: You carry a gun in the outland, you don’t
bring one into town less you live there. Don’t you know that?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m sorry, I forgot. I’ve been on the road a
long time.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Show me your hand.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m not a-</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: I said show me your fucking hand!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m not one of them.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m just passing through. I need some help. I
can pay.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: What kinda help? And what kinda pay?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m going to get something out of my pack.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I know, I know. Slowly.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Holy shit.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Where’d you find this?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Years ago, in the outland back east aways.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Does it work?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can you do it? I
got the cables.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Depends if you also got the coin.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: It’ll take a couple hours. There’s a bar
across the street you can wait, they just opened up.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’ll wait here.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: You don’t trust me?</p>
<p>****: I don’t know you.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Survey team just finished up their
inspection. It ain’t good.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: How bad is it?</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Pressure is down again, and going by the
new rod they sank levels’re lower than they’ve ever been.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: How long?</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A little
longer if we’re careful. But we’re already-</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Halve the rations.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: We just halved `em last-</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: So halve them again!</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: You’re going to have to say something.
Folks were none too happy last time. Gonna be worse now, you can count
on it.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I want you all to remember how far we’ve
come together. And how far we still can go, if only we believe. When I
brought us here to this oasis - this promised land - we knew there would
be hardships. Knew there would be sacrifices. But we also knew that we
were creating for ourselves a world where we could be safe from the
horrors of the forsaken lands beyond our borders.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: And I want you all to remember above all
that it is not the water with which we have been blessed that is the
true lifeblood of this town… but faith.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: It is our faith that sustains us, brothers
and sisters! Hallelujah!</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: And mark me, the ultimate validation of
that faith is coming! The sacred Word of Our Lord that formed the world
before and will reform it once again is coming to this town to bring it
succor, bring it nourishment, bring it new life! For the Almighty
Himself has spoken unto me and promised it!</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: In the meantime, He has asked us all to be
patient. To walk the hard road of the faithful just a little longer. And
to do that, we must give just a little more.</p>
<p>****: Water rations will be halved until further notice.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I understand your frustration. The road to
salvation is a difficult one - but what lies at the end of that road is
a greater glory, beyond anything you can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>discontented villager</strong>: We’ve heard this all before!
When are you going to-</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I know each and every one of you will
understand the necessity of this action. It was faith that built this
town - and faith that will sustain it even through the dark times that
may lie ahead. But it is always darkest before dawn - and the new dawn
is coming.</p>
<p>****: May God go with you all.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: One of the road crews just rolled into
town.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Of course they did, the bar’s open.
Outlanders, always looking for answers at the bottom of a bottle.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Not these guys.</p>
<p>****: These guys say they got something.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Get them up here now.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Gentlemen! It’s truly a delight to see you
again! I understand your latest excursion into the outland has been a
profitable one?</p>
<p><strong>hog</strong>: We did good.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Well, let’s see, shall we?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: No. No. No. No. No.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: It’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>hog</strong>: These ain’t worth nothin’?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: When you bring me the book I asked you
for, it’ll be worth something.</p>
<p><strong>hog</strong>: We been doin’ this a long time now. Had to make
a whole lotta corpses to bring you all these books. You want us to keep
at it, reckon it’s worth more than a few free glasses of that swill you
call liquor.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you once
again to take the long view here. When we find this book - and believe
me, we will find it - we are going to build a new world. A world far
greater, far more righteous than this one. And you and I are going to be
perched right on top of it, looking down upon it, masters of all
creation!</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: And you know, I think you’re absolutely
right.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: The book I want is out there somewhere,
just waiting to be found. Once there were millions of copies - you only
need to find one! Find it and bring it here. And I promise you, you will
be rewarded beyond anything you can imagine.</p>
<p><strong>hog</strong>: This better not be bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Might help if they knew just what they
were looking for.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Not one of them can read. How would they
even know when they found it?</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: So how’s about you just tell me?</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Two years now you been sending these crews
into the outland. Burning up gas we can barely spare. For a goddamn
book? What the hell kinda book can be worth all this?</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: What about these?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Put them with the others.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: What’s this place across the street? They got
any water?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: We got our own underground spring here.
Only fresh water in a hundred miles - if’s you can pay for it.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: If that battery ain’t here when I get back, I
will use this gun on your kneecaps and I will put this building to the
torch and I will watch it burn to the ground with you alive inside it.
So help me God.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Is that you, honey?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: More books came in from the road
today.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Oh? It’s been a while.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: And it’ll be a while longer. Just another
pile of useless junk. If we don’t find the right one soon - if I can’t
give these people what they want to hear…</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You’ll find what you’re looking for. It’s
out there somewhere. You just have to have faith.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Faith? Is that what you think we’re
missing around here?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: My old man used to have faith. He had it
in spades. My mother, too.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Faith is for the weak. It’s for them out
there, the sheep. This world is what you can see and touch and taste.
It’s what you make it. All these years with me, you still don’t have any
grasp of that? What’s wrong with you, woman?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: No, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to scare you.
Hey. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You just get me all riled up with that
kind of talk. It’s not what I need from you right now.</p>
<p>****: You know what I need right now?</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Outlander? Let me see-</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What’ll it be?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Water.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: That’s the good stuff. Gotta eat into my
own ration to sell it - so I don’t sell it cheap.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: That’ll get you maybe half-way.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: What about that?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: That’s the best I got.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Solara!</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Take this out back and get it filled.</p>
<p><strong>hog</strong>: That was my cat.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Fine specimen.</p>
<p><strong>hog</strong>: I saw you push him off the bar.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I didn’t push him.</p>
<p><strong>hog</strong>: You raised your hand at him.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Sorry. It won’t happen again.</p>
<p><strong>bartender</strong>: Hey, how about another drink, Hog?</p>
<p><strong>hog</strong>: That cat’s been comin’ in here for nigh on two
years. It got more right to be here than you. Who the fuck do you think
you are?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I don’t want any trouble.</p>
<p><strong>hog</strong>: Well, that’s too bad, `cause-</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I know you. Murderer of innocent travelers on
the road. You’re going to spend eternity drowning in a lake of fire for
the things that you’ve done. Did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You go on back to your table and I’ll be on my
way. All right?</p>
<p><strong>burly patron</strong>: You push Hog, you push all of us.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Cursed be the ground because of you. By toil
shall you eat of it. Thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you. From
the ground were you taken. For dust you are.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: And to dust you shall return.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Did you hear that? What was that?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Maybe you should go check.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: What in the hell is going on?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Get your asses out here!</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Please don’t.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Go.</p>
<p>****: …What?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It ain’t for me to judge you. Your time for
that’s gonna come. Believe me. Now go on. Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m sorry for all the mess.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Hold it right there.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: So, who are you?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Nobody. A walker in the outland.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I’ve met walkers before. Not a
particularly civilized bunch. Some have even taken to eating their own
kind, did you know that? You wouldn’t be one of those savages now, would
you?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie gunman</strong>: He ain’t got the shakes.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Good. This is a civilized town. Under God.
Do you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: It means we have laws here. Laws set down
long before any of us ever walked this earth. And one of them is, you
don’t eat the flesh of your brother. Else you’re no better than an
animal. And not welcome here.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: So what’s your business here, friend?
Walkers don’t usually come into town less they want something.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I had a battery needed charging and a canteen
needed filling. I didn’t come here looking for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Well, you sure as hell found it. Do you
know who I am?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: My name’s Carnegie. I own this bar. I own
the whole town. You’ve never heard of me?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: That’s you out there on the street.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Remarkable likeness, isn’t it? You’d never
guess half the men who built it were blind. A small tribute from a
grateful people. I was deeply touched.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You had slaves build you a monument to
yourself?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Don’t call them slaves. That’s an old
word. I’m not a slaver. I’m trying to help these people.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: In the outland the sightless are preyed
upon like sick animals. Here at least they’re protected. They do the
essential work others don’t want. And in return they eat, they drink,
they survive. Last year, a couple of them even got married - performed
the ceremony myself.</p>
<p>****: You see, I’m not exploiting these people - I’m saving them! Any
one of them is free to leave whenever they wish. But here they stay. And
they thank me every single day for their salvation!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s none of my business what you do here. Like
you said, it’s your town. I just want to be on my way.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: What’s your name, walker?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: All right, I guess we just call you
Walker. Don’t see too many folks your age these days. You lived in the
world before? You can read?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I read every day.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: That’s good. Good man. We educated folk,
we need to stick together, if we’re ever going to rebuild this world.
People like you and me, we’re the future.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: What do you want with me?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Straight to the point. I like that. Fact
is, you could be in a lot of trouble. This is a peaceful town. You walk
in here, armed, and the next thing a dozen of my good citizens are dead.
I’ve hanged men for less. I could hang you.</p>
<p>****: Or, you could come work for me.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I never once saw anyone handle themselves
the way you did down there in that bar. I don’t know where you learned
it, but I sure as hell could use it.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m not interested.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: People who work for me can live better
than any walker ever dreamed. Real beds, clean water, hot food. Women,
even. You could do a lot worse, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m not your friend. And I’m not staying. I got
someplace I need to be. Out west.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: West? There is nothing west. It’s all
gone, a long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’ve been told different.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: By who?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: All right, look. I’m going to make you an
offer of goodwill. Stay the night, think it over. Try a little local
hospitality. We’ll talk again in the morning. If you’re still not
interested, you’re free to go. No hard feelings.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Thank you for your offer. But I’d prefer to
just leave right now. So you can either let me out of here, or I can
kill my way out.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: Oh, shit…</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: How’s my battery?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: It’s, uh… it’s gonna take a little longer
than I thought.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: How much longer?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: It’s gotta charge overnight. You, uh, you
can always stay here in town, pick it up in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You remember what I said would happen if I came
back here and you didn’t have my battery?</p>
<p><strong>engineer</strong>: It’s right here! It’s just gonna take a
while longer. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I knew you’d reconsider.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Yeah? How’d you know that?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: None of the walkers I’ve seen come here
from the outland were ever what you’d call smart. I mean all those years
out there alone on the road, some with their brains half- fried from
eating each other - it’s understandable why you people aren’t the
brightest bulbs in the box. But I never met one so dumb that he’d turn
down a meal and a bed if it was offered.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: So you didn’t send someone across the street to
the engineer?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Engineer? I don’t know what you’re talking
about. If there’s something wrong, maybe I can help.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: This is Redridge. He’s kind of my
right-hand man around here.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: He’ll show you to your room.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Enjoy your stay. There’ll be someone
outside your room all night. If you need anything.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I have this for you. Water for washing and
some food.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Well… are you going to take it?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Oh. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You’re very welcome.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It’ll be dark soon.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Can I get you anything else?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Well. Have a good night.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You’re Carnegie’s woman?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Just making conversation is all. Haven’t had
one of those in a while. Not a real one, leastways.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: He found me in the outland. I was sixteen,
my family had been… well, they were gone. There was just me and my
baby.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You had a baby?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’d met some men on the road. Bad men.
They…</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I was on the road for a year after that. I
couldn’t feed myself, let alone my little girl. And then Bill found us
and he promised he’d take care of us. He told me he was going to make a
place where we could be safe. And he did. He did all that. He built this
whole town. He kept us safe. And he raised that child like she was his
own. He’s been so good to both of us. He saved us, really.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You want to eat some?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: When did you go blind? In the war? You get
caught in a flash?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No, I was born this way. I think I’m lucky
like that.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Lucky?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: It’s not like I ever knew what I’m missing.
I was already used to being like this by the time… by the time it all
happened. So I got around pretty good even when I was on my own. And now
it’s easy. I know every creaky old floorboard in here, and it’s not like
I ever go any place else. Bill would never allow it. He worries about me
so much.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I should go. He’ll be wondering where I
am.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Thank you. I enjoyed our conversation.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: So did I.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You took your time in there. How long does
it take to deliver a plate of food and some water?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: He wanted to talk.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Oh? What about?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Nothing really. He asked me what it was
like to be blind.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: He tell you anything about him?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: No. I don’t think he likes to talk about
himself much.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Yeah, I got that.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I don’t think he’s going to change his mind
by morning. I don’t think he’s going to stay.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: What makes you say that?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Just strikes me as the kind of man who’s of
a mind, is all. Doesn’t seem like the type to go changing it once it’s
set.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Well, we’ll just see about that.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You saw him. He’s not like the others. You
won’t be able to smooth- talk him and wrap him around your finger like
you usually do.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Who said anything about me?</p>
<p>****: I’m sending Solara.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You’re doing what?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You know how often these walkers get laid?
Never. Least not by anything living or willing. Girl like her can be
very persuasive.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: You can’t send her in there with him. He’s
dangerous, he’s a killer!</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You went in there readily enough.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: That’s different. Solara’s just a child,
she can’t-</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: She’s a grown woman now, Claudia. Sooner
or later you’re going to have to accept that. She has to earn her keep
around here, same as the rest of us.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: By working as a whore? That’s all you think
she’s fit for?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: We’ve each been given a talent to help us
make our way in this world. Some people’s gift is more evident than
others. Solara’s sure as hell is.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What kind of a man are you?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I’m the kind of man who’d pull a helpless
blind girl off the road, a girl who’d been beaten and raped, and give
her a place where she can live without fear! Without me you’d be just
another no-eye, lying dead in the outland, picked clean by the buzzards,
or shoveling dirt down there with the others. That’s the kind of man I
am!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I don’t live without fear. I haven’t for a
long time now.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m not going to let you do this.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You’re not going to let me?</p>
<p>****: Nobody tells me what I can and can’t do in my own town. Nobody.
I built this world, and I am God here! So don’t go thinking about
screwing with my plans. You know how this works. Solara goes against me,
you get hurt. You go against me, she gets hurt.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: So let’s not see anybody get hurt.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Come in.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Hi. Can I come in?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Someone was already here with food and water. I
got everything I need.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: You sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: It’s too bright in here. Mind if I turn it
down a little?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: That’s better. I’m Solara. You’re Walker,
right?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No. My name’s Eli.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: That short for something? Elias?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Elijah.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Elijah. I never heard that one before. It’s
kinda cute.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Look, I don’t mean to be rude. But I’m really
not interested.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: You sure about that? It gets mighty lonely
out there on the road.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: If you’re worried about money, this is all
paid for. The whole night.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s not that. You’re a very nice girl. But I’m
not that kind of man.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: They’re all that kind of man.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: They told me you were crazy. Maybe they were
right.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m sorry. Good night.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Please don’t make me leave. I have to stay
the night. If I don’t…</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: If you don’t, what?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: He’ll hurt my mom.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Who will? Carnegie?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Maybe he and I oughta have words.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: No! Please, don’t!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: He’s hurting you. He’s hurting your mother.
He’s-</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: He’s my dad.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Look, if you want to help me, just let me
stay here tonight. We don’t have to do anything. I’ll sleep on the
floor. Tomorrow you can tell my dad that we had a good time. I’ll be no
trouble, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You want to have a conversation?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You know, you don’t have to be afraid of me.
What happened down there in the bar…</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I’m not afraid of you. I know you didn’t
start that trouble. When I first saw you, I knew you weren’t the type to
go looking for it.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: How’d you know that?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: My mom says I’m a good judge of character.
She says I can read people. That I know a good man when I see one.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: So… you’re pretty old, right?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I’m sorry. I just mean, I haven’t seen too
many people your age. How old are you exactly?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You know, I don’t rightly remember.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: But you’re old enough. I mean, you remember
what it was like? In the world before?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What was it like?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Better than this.</p>
<p>****: People lived longer back then. Longer than me. Some were more
than a hundred years old.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I swear, it’s true. Nowadays it’s not the same.
If you’re sick or you’re weak or you’re old you won’t last long out on
the road.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: So how come you have?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Can I read you something?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Wait. You can read?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: And you have a book?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Not just any book.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He
makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He
restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Though I walk through the valley of the shadow
of death, I will fear no evil. For you are with me. Your rod and your
staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of
my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. Surely
goodness and mercy shall follow me, all the days of my life. And I will
dwell in the house of the Lord forever.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: That’s beautiful. Did you write that?</p>
<p>****: No.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What book is it from? Is it poetry?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I guess you could think of it that way. It’s
from the Holy Bible.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I never heard of it. What’s it about?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s about love, and forgiveness, and life and
death, and mercy, and revenge, and the beginning and the end of the
world. I guess it’s about a little bit of everything.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Can I see?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What? I’m not going to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m charged to protect this book. I
can’t trust it with anyone. Not even for a while.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What’s so special about that book?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s the last one. There are no other books
like this. All the others are gone - destroyed by the war or in the
burnings that came after. This is the only one that survived until now.
The last one anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: How can you know that?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I just know.</p>
<p>****: For a long while after it happened, I just wandered on the road
like most everybody else. There were still a lot of people around back
then, in the beginning. I didn’t really know what I should do or where I
was going. I was just moving from place to place, trying to stay alive.
And then one day I heard this voice. I don’t know how to explain it,
it’s like it was coming from inside me. But I could hear it, clear as
day. Clear as I can hear you talking to me now.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What did it say?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It led me to this place, I don’t really know
where. And I found this book buried deep under some rubble. No way
no-one was ever going to find it if they didn’t know exactly where to
look.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: But you knew because the voice told you?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: That’s right. And that voice told me to carry
the book west.</p>
<p>****: That was twenty-five years ago. And I’ve been walking ever
since.</p>
<p>****: Because a voice you heard in your head told you to.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m not crazy. I didn’t imagine it. I know what
I heard.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: So who was it? The voice?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: A very important, very powerful man.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: More powerful than my dad?</p>
<p>****: I should say so, yes.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Would you teach me to read?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I never learned. No-one around here knows
how. Only my dad, and he won’t teach me. I think he likes being the only
one who can read. I think it makes him feel powerful.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I think you’re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: So would you teach me?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m sorry. I’m leaving tomorrow. And I won’t be
back this way, ever.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Are you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I guess a little.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: There’s some food on the table over there.
Let’s eat.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s okay, it’s okay. He’s with me. Don’t be
afraid, pal. This is Solara. She’s our friend.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s okay. It means he likes you.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: It does?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Trust me, if he didn’t like you, you’d know
about it.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Did you really mean that?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Mean what?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: That I’m your friend.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Our father, we thank you for this meal which
you have been so gracious to place before us.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: We thank you for a warm bed and a roof over our
heads on a cold night such as this.</p>
<p>****: And we thank you for the gift of friendship in these hard
times.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p>****: You say that last part too.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Amen. And now we eat?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: And now we eat.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Good morning, Solara.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I said good morning, Solara.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Morning, dad.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: How was your night? Did you sleep
well?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I did like you asked. Isn’t that what you
really want to know? Just come out and say it.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You don’t speak to your father like that.
When I ask you a civil question, I expect a civil answer.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Did he say anything?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: No. We didn’t talk much.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Well, do you think you managed to change
his mind about staying?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I don’t know. He said he had to go.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: So he did talk? What else did he say? Come
on, I want all of it!</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: That’s all he said. That he was going to be
leaving this morning.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: We’ll see. This is my town, nobody leaves
until I say they leave.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Solara, honey, eat something.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Our father, thank you for this meal which
you have been so gracious to place before us.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Thank you for my mother. Please watch over
her and keep her safe.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Solara…</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Thank you for all the-</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Solara!</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: God didn’t put this food on the table. Do
you hear me?</p>
<p>****: Who put this food on the table?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I said who put this food on the table?</p>
<p>****: You did.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Who taught you that?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Eli taught me.</p>
<p>****: Who the hell is Eli?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: The walker. That’s his name.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: And he taught you how to say those words?
How did he know them?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: He had them written down in a book.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: What kind of a book?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I don’t remember! It was an old leather
book. It had kind of a… thing on the front of it.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: He had a bible?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: That’s what it was. A holy bible. Daddy,
what’s wrong? Did I…</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Something wrong, boss?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Something wrong? Something wrong? The
walker’s gone!</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: That can’t be. I had a man outside his
room the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: He jumped out the window, you idiot! You
didn’t think to put a man outside the fucking window? Find him. Now!</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Boss, he could be anywhere. He…</p>
<p>****: A battery. Didn’t he say something about a battery?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Go! Go!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It ain’t your concern. Stay on the path.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Dammit…</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Let her go.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: That cannon of yours casts a pretty wide
net. I don’t reckon you can hit me without hitting her.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I reckon you’re right.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: This, though? With this I’ll shave the hairs
clean off your balls at a hundred paces. You believe me?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I believe you. I have to say I’m surprised
to hear that language coming from you, though. I mean, you being a holy
man and all.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: She told me all about it. Told me all
about the bible, too.</p>
<p>****: Can I see it?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You know, I’ve been searching for a book
like that one for years. All I’ve ever wanted was to bring the word of
God to these poor unfortunates here. To shine its light upon them and
give them something in this wretched world that they could believe in.
Something to live for! It’s why I built this town, did you know that?
All we’ve been missing is the word to show us the way. And now, praise
the Lord, you’ve brought it to us.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: It’s not right to keep that book hidden
away, all to yourself. The word is meant to be shared with others. It’s
meant to be spread! Isn’t that what you want? I could help you do that.
You and me, we could do it together.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: The Lord himself told me that if I carried this
book west, one day I would find the place where it was needed. Where it
would be safe. Where it belonged.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: But this ain’t it.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You shall not make for yourself any graven
image…</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Now we can go.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Where are we going?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I told you where I’m going. You’re free to go
wherever you want.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Wait… I’m not coming with you?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You’re only going to slow me down.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: So what the hell was all that about back
there?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: The man was hurting you. I don’t like that, so
I put a stop to it. Now you’re free. He can’t hurt you any more. No need
to thank me.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Thank you? For what? What am I supposed to
do now?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Whatever you want. That’s what being free
is.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Whatever I want. Except go with you.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I have to get where I’m going. I can’t be
worrying about someone else along the way.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I thought you were my friend.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s dangerous in the outland. I wouldn’t want
you to get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I’ll be safe so long as I’m with you. I know
it.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You don’t want this life. I gotta do what I
gotta do. Don’t have no choice in it. But you do. And I can’t let you
choose this. You don’t want to be like me. You don’t want to spend your
life alone.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: If I came with you, I wouldn’t be alone. And
neither would you.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m sorry. Look, maybe it’s best you just go on
back to town.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Fine! I’ll do just that! I had a life there!
A family! I didn’t ask you to save me! I didn’t ask you for
anything!</p>
<p>****: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Thank you, darling.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: He killed four of my men and walked out of
town without a scratch. They shot off a hundred rounds at him and he
didn’t get hit once. I never even heard of anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You know, I always thought of myself as a
shepherd. Bringing together the wayward and the lost. Tending to my
flock. But all the things I want to do, I can’t do them on my own. The
one thing I’ve needed is the one thing that’s always been missing. Then
one day it walks right into town - so close I can almost touch it - and
then walks right on out again.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I want you to put a crew together and go
out after him.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: He’s not going to work for you. I think
he’s made that plain.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: I’m not interested in him any more. I only
want the book he’s carrying.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: If I’m gonna risk my ass hunting down this
maniac in the outland, I need to know it’s gonna be worth it. I need to
know what’s so special about this goddamn book.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You have no idea. You’re too young, you
don’t remember the world before. But I do. I remember.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: When I was a kid my parents used to read
that book every goddamn day. My mother, she’d read it along with this
smooth-talking preacher on the TV screen. They used to be able to beam
these guys right into your house, into every house in the world, through
the air. Like magic.</p>
<p>****: She worked two jobs and she sent every spare penny she had to
that fucking guy on the TV. My old man, he’d read that book, then he’d
get liquored up and kick my ass, tell me all about the power and the
glory and how I was going to burn forever in hell for the sins I was
born with. He made sure he beat it into me good.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Don’t you see? It’s not just any book.</p>
<p>****: Do you remember how I built this town? It wasn’t done with
force, and it wasn’t done just with water. It was done with the power of
words. I created this place out of nothing, because people believed in a
promise that I sold to them. Those guys on the TV, they were richer than
you could ever dream, and it was all built the same way. With words.
With promises. And with that book.</p>
<p>****: That book is a weapon. Aimed right at the hearts and minds of
the weak and the desperate. Just imagine what I could do with it.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Boss… we’re running out of water and the
people are running out of patience. You’re trying to tell me that a book
is going to keep them in line?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Oh, it’ll do much more than that. The
water in this town may run dry, but faith - that springs eternal! And
that faith will help turn this town into a city. And this city into a
nation. It will help me build a new world. In my image. People will come
from far and wide to hear what’s inside of it. They’ll follow me
anywhere just to get a taste of it. And they’ll do whatever I tell
them.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: And what if this book don’t work? What if
it don’t say what you want it to say?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Oh, it’ll say what I want, I can promise
you that. Because I’m going to rewrite it. I’ll keep the parts that work
for me and make the rest whatever I need it to be.</p>
<p>****: A new bible, for a new world.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: What do you think, darling? A whole new
world, to do with as we will. Won’t that be grand?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Find that book.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: He has half a day on us already.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: So use the motor pool.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: There ain’t much gas in reserve.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Whatever there is, use it.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What about Solara?</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: She’s still out there. With him.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Right. Right. Of course. Bring her back,
too, if you can. But-</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: The book. I know.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Shit. Shit.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Where the hell am I?</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>female voice</strong>: Hello? Can anyone help me?</p>
<p><strong>slumped female</strong>: Hello? Is anybody there?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Oh. Yes, I’m fine. Thank you. You go
along, I’ll be okay.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: You look like you need some help.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: No, really! I’m fine. Really… I need a
man to help. Not you. You just keep along. Please.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: It’ll just take a minute.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Really, it’s fine! Please!</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: Let her go! She ain’t got nothing!</p>
<p><strong>brigand leader</strong>: I ain’t too sure about that.</p>
<p><strong>young woman</strong>: This wasn’t the deal!</p>
<p><strong>brigand leader</strong>: Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta
be grateful you’re getting a break.</p>
<p><strong>brigand leader</strong>: Never did care much for that dried-
up old snatch anyhow.</p>
<p><strong>brigand leader</strong>: This one, though… this one looks
fresh. You a virgin?</p>
<p><strong>brigand leader</strong>: Well, let’s find out.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I offer you both one final chance in this life
to seek forgiveness for your sins so that your souls may find salvation.
Will you say with me the act of contrition?</p>
<p><strong>brigand leader</strong>: Fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Some might think it’d be most fitting to leave
you here like this. Let you die slow in the sun. But I know better. I
know where you’re going. And the sooner you get there, the sooner you’ll
get what’s coming to you.</p>
<p><strong>rifle bandit</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>rifle bandit</strong>: I want to say it. I want to be
forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Repeat after me. Oh God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee, and I detest all my sins.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace,
to confess my sins, and do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>rifle bandit</strong>: Amen…</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: You came back for me.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: What are friends for?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: This is the deal. You keep up. You pull your
weight. You fall behind, I can’t help you. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: There’s nothing can be done for her.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: You killed it! That cute little thing!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s good eating, is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: That’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: If you’re going to be on the road, you can’t be
picky about what you eat. You eat what’s there to eat.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I’m not eating that.</p>
<p>****: More for me.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Father, we thank you for your generosity in
providing us with this meal. Bless this food to our use and us to thy
service, and keep us ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What does that taste like?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Tastes like chicken.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s a Saint Christopher medal.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Who’s Saint Christopher? Is he a character
from your book?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Christopher was a man who lived a long time
ago. He wanted to be a good man, he wanted to help people. So he would
stand by a river that had no bridge and carry people across. He was a
big strong man and there was no one he couldn’t carry.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Then one day a young child came to the river
and asked to be carried across. Christopher tried to carry him but he
was too heavy. He was just a small boy but he was heavier than any man
he had ever carried. The boy explained that he was the son of God, and
that he was so heavy because he bore all the sins of the world. After
that, Christopher was able to carry him across and when they got to the
other side the boy baptized him in the river. And that’s how he became a
saint. Later on, he was known as the patron saint of travelers.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What is a saint, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s someone who spent their life doing good
things for others. Enough that God himself took a special interest in
them.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Someone like you.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No. Not like me. Saints ain’t killers. And I
done too much of that. Spilled too much blood.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Will you read me some more from the
book?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s late. You should get some sleep. Maybe
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Eli?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: You scared me! I thought you were
asleep.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: On the road you sleep with one eye open. I
asked you what you were doing.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I just wanted to see the book.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You want to see the book, you ask me. Nobody
touches it but me. Ever. Until it gets where it’s going. Do you
understand?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Tell me you understand!</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Okay! I understand! Ow!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s no use to you anyway. You don’t know how
to read it.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Well… now we have the time, maybe you can
teach me.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Maybe. Get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: He’s been here.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: The girl’s with him.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Move out!</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: I said move out!</p>
<p><strong>carnegie gunman</strong>: I heard this guy’s protected
somehow, some… power from up above. That there ain’t nothing on this
earth can touch him.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: He’s just a man. You put a bullet in him,
he’ll go down like any other. I don’t want to hear no more of this
superstitious horseshit!</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: You say you’ve been walking for twenty-five
years. Have you ever considered that you might be lost?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: But how can you know? How can you know this
is the right way?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I told you. My path has been laid out before
me.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Yeah, but laid out by who?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: By Almighty God.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Well if this God guy’s so mighty, how come
it’s taking you so long to get where you’re going? Doesn’t he know the
way?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You want to stay on this road with me, don’t
ever let me hear you take his name in vain like that again.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: God has a reason for everything being the way
it is. It’s not always apparent to us. But it is his plan
nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: So, is he talking to you right now? Telling
you where to go?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s not like that. It’s kinda hard to explain.
I’m guided by faith.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I don’t know what that word means.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It means you know something even though you
don’t know it.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: That doesn’t make any sense at all.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It doesn’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I don’t get it. It looks almost… normal.
Like nothing ever happened. How can it still be out here?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Maybe we should look inside. There might be
food.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Stay behind me.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: This is weird.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: My name is Eli. This is Solara. We’re
travelers, that’s all. We don’t mean you any harm.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: You cut my padlock. I saw you. Trying
to break into our house.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I’m sorry. We didn’t think anybody lived here.
We thought it was abandoned, like all the rest.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Take a look around you. Look at this
yard. Does it look abandoned to you?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No, sir. I… like what you’ve done with the
place.</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: What’s your business here?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: No business. We’re sorry to have troubled you.
If you’ll let us down we’ll happily be on our way.</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: George, look at them! They’re not
robbers or road agents! One of them’s just a girl!</p>
<p><strong>elderly man</strong>: Seen that before. Oldest trick in the
book.</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: Oh, stop! It’s no trick. Let them
down!</p>
<p><strong>elderly woman</strong>: I’m so sorry about my husband. We so
rarely get visitors these days, he’s suspicious of everybody.</p>
<p>****: I’m Martha and this is my husband George. Would you care for
some tea?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I’m afraid we don’t have any cake or
biscuits for the tea. They ran out some time ago.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: How do you like it?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s.. uh…</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: It’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Have you always lived here?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: For almost forty years now. This home is our
pride and joy, isn’t it, George?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: We refused to leave, even during the
troubles. We said, didn’t we George, we said if we’re going to die
anywhere, we’re going to die right here, in our own home.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I don’t understand how you’ve survived out here
this long.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Well, George is something of a handyman,
aren’t you, dear? He did a lot of work on the place, making it safe. We
may be old, but we’re resilient. We’ve had more than a few who’ve tried
to take this place from us. Haven’t we, George?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Yes. Yes we have.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Are these… graves?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Of course. It would be uncivilized not to
bury them. We’re not barbarians.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Plus, it’s good for the soil.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Come on back inside. I think I might be able
to rustle up some sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: We have to get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: They look so sweet… I would never have
believed they were killers.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: They’re worse than that.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: They didn’t just kill these people.</p>
<p>****: They ate them.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: They what?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: There’s a disease in the outland. Spread by
eating human meat. It affects the brain. Dementia, loss of motor
function. Did you notice the old woman’s hands shaking? She’s got it.
They’ve both got it.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Oh my God…</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I found some meat for those sandwiches! Are
you hungry?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: No! Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: We really must be going.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: So soon?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Yes, I’m afraid so.</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Are you sure you won’t stay?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Yes. Thank you again for the tea.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Oh no… it’s my dad. It’s his men.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I recognize the cars.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Back inside.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What did you bring upon us?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: George? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: A whole convoy of armed degenerates, that’s
what’s wrong! Coming here for them! And they led them right to us!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Oh no they don’t…</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Martha, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: I finally got this house just the way I want
it. I’m not going to let anybody tear it apart!</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Where did you get all this stuff?</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Took `em off them who came looking to take
the place from us. Built up quite the stash over the years.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: You know how to fire a gun?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: My daddy showed me once.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Just like riding a bike.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I never rode a bike.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: How about you, you know how to-</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: We know you’re in there! Come on out with
your hands up and your weapons on the deck and nobody needs to get
hurt.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: All right, look. I’m gonna make it easy on
y’all. Bring out the girl with the book.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: That’s all we want. The girl and the book.
The rest of you’s can go your way.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Hand me my pack.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie gunman #2</strong>: They ain’t comin’ out. They-</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Holy shi…</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Get down! Everybody get down!</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Damn you, return fire!</p>
<p><strong>martha</strong>: Come and get it, you god-damn sons of
mother-fucking bitches!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s all right. We’re going to be all right.
Trust me.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You remember what I told you about faith?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: We’re going to get out of this alive. Both of
us. I know.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Because God told you?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Because God told me.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: What about us?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: He didn’t mention you.</p>
<p><strong>george</strong>: Martha? Martha!</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: We got any more of those RPGs?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie gunman #3</strong>: That was it.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Screw this.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Get clear!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Solara?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Eli!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Oh God…</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Come on. We’re going out the back. We’re
running.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Go ahead and try it, holy man. You ain’t
that fast.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Where’s the book?</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: I ain’t playing.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Check the pack.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie gunman #4</strong>: It ain’t here.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: It’s gotta be.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Hello, what have we here?</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Fuck! Get it off! Get it off me!</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: If you don’t got the book, what fucking
use are you?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: It’s here! I’ve got it! Please don’t kill
him.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Solara…</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: It’s just a book, Eli. No book is worth
giving up your life for.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You’re wrong.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: You did good, sweetheart. Your daddy would
be proud. He knew you’d come through for him.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: He said he would hurt my mom. If I didn’t
help him.</p>
<p>****: Daddy’s little girl…</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I want you to let him go.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: You’ve got what you came for. You don’t need
him. Let him go.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: He’s killed a dozen of my men.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: If you hurt him, I’m not coming back with
you. You’ll have to drag me kicking and screaming.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Take your shit and get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: No weapons.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I told you we’d both live. Now do you have
faith?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: What the hell…?</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Stop, stop!</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Shit. Turn around!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: We ain’t got the gas for it!</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: She’s getting away!</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: We got the book! And we got barely enough
gas to make it back as it is! We can’t go chasin’ her!</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: Stupid little bitch…</p>
<p>****: Drive on.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Come on, come on…</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: No… No!</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Eli! Eli!</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Eli…</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Thought you’d gone back to town.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I can’t go back there. Eli, I’m so
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: For what? I betrayed you! I gave them the
book!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: You did what you believed you had to.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: You’re not mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Here. I thought you might still need
this.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What are you going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Same as always. Keep heading west.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Why? I mean, you don’t have the book any
more.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: But I still have my faith.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s grass. It used to grow all over the
place.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: How come it’s here?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I don’t know. Less poison in the air this near
to the ocean, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Nothing. Just a cramp.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Do you smell that?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Smell what?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Salt in the air. We’re close to the ocean.
We’re almost there.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Watch your footing. Step where I step.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: This… this is the world before?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: What’s left of it.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Do you see that?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I see it. Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Who goes there?</p>
<p><strong>alcatraz guard</strong>: Identify yourselves!</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: My name is Elijah Stone. I have a message for
your boss. I need you to tell him that I have a King James Bible in my
possession.</p>
<p><strong>alcatraz guard</strong>: Remain where you are! Do not attempt
to move or you will be fired upon!</p>
<p><strong>alcatraz guard</strong>: Be prepared to surrender any weapons
at the gate!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: They’re clean.</p>
<p><strong>thin man</strong>: Welcome, both of you. I’m Professor
Lombardi. I’m the curator here.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Elijah Stone.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Solara.</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Solara. What a delightful name. Is that by
any chance Shakespearean?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: I, uh, I think it’s Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Is it true what they tell me? You have a
King James Version?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Been carrying it with me for twenty- five
years.</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: My goodness. I can’t tell you how exciting
this is. Well, come, come!</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Yes, we’ve been doing this for some time
now. Collected over thirty thousand volumes from generous donors all
across the nation. We even have a printing press that we hope to have
operational soon.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: You turned the whole prison into a
library?</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Well, not exactly. We’re more like a
storage facility. We’re holding these books here in trust, if you like.
When society gets back on its feet and no longer needs us to preserve
these volumes, they’ll be here waiting.</p>
<p>****: I must ask you, how did you hear about us? We’ve been doing
everything we can to get the word out, but we always like to know where
our benefactors come from.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I was sent here by God.</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Is that right? Well, it’s good to know
we’re getting such high- profile referrals these days.</p>
<p>****: I must say, I am so excited that we finally have a King James.
You know, we have a Talmud here, we have two Korans, we even have that
Scientology book. But never a Christian bible, until now. I honestly
believed it was the one book I’d never see again, after what
happened…</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: May I ask what condition it’s in?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: It’s a little beat-up. But it’ll do the
job.</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Well, then. What say we take a look at
it?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Is there someplace we could sit?</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Of course. Right this way.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: The new world begins here…</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: What the fuck is this?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Do you have something you can write with?</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Mmm? Oh, yes of course!</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Could you please bring us some writing
paper?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Bring a lot of it.</p>
<p><strong>redridge</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: What exactly am I writing?</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Pay close attention and write down every word
exactly as I say it.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: The First Book of Moses called Genesis. Chapter
one, verse one. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
Verse two. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the
face of the deep. And the spirit of God was hovering over the face of
the waters. Verse three. And God said, “Let there be light,” and there
was light.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You told me once that you know how to read
this. This blind language.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Well, a long time ago, when I was a little
girl…</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: You’re going to read it for me. Every
word. And I’m going to write it down. Start at the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: I’m sorry. It’s been so long. I don’t
remember. I don’t remember any of it.</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: God fucking dammit!</p>
<p><strong>claudia</strong>: Bill, is there something-</p>
<p><strong>carnegie</strong>: Just go. Just get out of my sight.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Dear Lord, thank you for giving me the strength
and the conviction to complete the task you entrusted to me. Thank you
for guiding me straight and true, through the many obstacles in my
path.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Thank you for your protection and for your many
signs along the way.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Thank you for the good that I have done. For
whatever light you were able to shine into the darkness of this world
through me.</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: You know, you don’t have to leave. You’re
welcome to stay here with us. You’ll be safe.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: But I gotta do what I gotta do.</p>
<p><strong>lombardi</strong>: Where will you go?</p>
<p><strong>solara</strong>: Home.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Thank you for the friend I made.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Please watch over her as you watched over
me.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: Thank you for allowing me finally to rest. I’m
so very tired. The time of my departure is at hand and now I surrender
my soul into your care, at peace in knowing that I have carried out your
will. That I have done right with my time on this earth.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I have fought the good fight. I have finished
the race.</p>
<p><strong>eli</strong>: I have kept the faith.</p>
