<p><strong>grifters</strong>: by Donald E. Westlake</p>
<p><strong>scene one</strong>: Lilly approaches the track’s entrance
doors.</p>
<p><strong>scene two</strong>: Roy approaches the bar.</p>
<p><strong>scene one</strong>: Lilly enters the track.</p>
<p><strong>scene two</strong>: Roy enters the bar.</p>
<p><strong>scene three</strong>: Myra enters the jeweler’s.</p>
<p><strong>bartender’s pov</strong>: Roy’s finger holds down a twenty
dollar bill.</p>
<p><strong>caller</strong>: And they’re off!</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Mrs. Langtry, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Why? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: You are a valued customer, as you know.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: But what’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: I can’t understand a thing like this. It’s
something you almost never see.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: What is?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: This is some of the finest filigreed
platinum I’ve ever seen. But the stones, no. They’re not diamonds,
Mrs. Langtry.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: But they must be! They cut glass!</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Glass will cut glass, Mrs. Langtry. Do you
know where it was purchased?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: It was a gift. It isn’t worth anything at
all?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Why, of course it is. I can offer you –
well, five hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: I’ll get you a check.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: I hope you’re not too badly disappointed
with us, Mrs. Langtry.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: It’s not your fault.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: You’ll give us an opportunity to serve you
again, I hope. If there’s anything you think we might be interested
in…</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I have only one thing now. Are you
interested?</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: Well, I’d have to see it, of course.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You are seeing it. You’re looking right at
it.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>jeweler</strong>: You know something, Mrs. Langtry? A
bracelet like that very rarely happens. A fine setting and workmanship
usually mean precious stones. It always hurts me when I find they’re
not. I always hope – – I’m mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Thank you. For everything you felt you could
do.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Sir? Everything all right?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Getting better. A bad shrimp, I think.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Want us to take you to a doctor?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: No no, I’m fine now, thanks, anyway. Still got
a lot of clients to see.</p>
<p><strong>cop</strong>: Take it easy, now.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, I will.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Put it this way, now. Say I rent to a woman,
well, she has to have a room with a bath. I insist on it, because
otherwise she’s got the hall bath tied up all the time, washing her
goddamn hair and her clothes and everything she can think of.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Now, your minimum for a room with bath is
three hundred a month, just for a place to sleep and no cooking allowed.
And just how many of these tootsies make that kind of money and have to
eat in restaurants and buy clothes and –</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Mr. Simms.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Why yes, Mr. Dillon. Here’s a potential new
neighbor, looking at–</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Uh-huh. Mrs. Langtry may drop by.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: I’ll send her right up.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: I had my first hotel thirty-seven years ago
in Wichita Falls, Texas, and that’s where I began to learn about women.
They just don’t make the money, you see, not regular they don’t, and
there’s only one way they can get it.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Now, that Mr. Dillon there, that’s the fine
type of person I have in mind for here. Like yourself, I have no doubt.
He’s a salesman, regular as clockwork, has a suite here. Fine man. Now,
about these women. At first, you know, they just go out and do it now
and then, just enough to make ends meet. But pretty soon they got that
bank open twenty-four hours a day, and then you’ve got trouble. Hookers
and hotellin’ just don’t mix. You’d think the cops’d be too busy
catching real criminals, not snooping around after working girls, but
that’s the way the gravy stains, as the saying is, and I don’t fight it.
An ounce of prevention is my motto.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Oh, yes, Mrs. Langtry, he’s up there, he’s
expecting you.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: If you keep out the women in the first place,
see, you keep out the hookers, and then you keep out the cops, and
that’s how you have a clean place.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Roy?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Your medicine is here.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Always, for you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You aren’t taking me for granted, are you?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Taking you for granite?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That isn’t granite. If that fell on me, it
wouldn’t hurt at all.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Let’s find out.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’m done here. Do I come back to
Baltimore?</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Bobo wants you to go on to Delmar.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Delmar? I never go out to California. That’s
a thousand miles from here.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Nine hundred. Bobo needs somebody to handle
playback this time. Come on, Lilly, you don’t argue with Bobo.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Take two, three days. Call when you get
there.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Maybe I’ll swing around Los Ang gleez on the
way.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Roy?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Mm?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, I am, baby, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Roy? It this all we have?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: All? It ain’t bad.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: No more than this?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What are you talking abut, Myra? Marriage?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I didn’t say that. You aren’t marriage
material.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Ow! Hey, what are you trying to do, throw me
off my game?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: No, baby. Come to Mama.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Wore you out, did I? It’s a good woman you
can’t keep down, baby.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Have a good sleep, baby. Call you
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Wait’ll next year.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Damn that guy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Smack.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Heads.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Heads.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Tails.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Tails.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: How much can I bet?</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: That’s between you two. I got nothing at
stake here, I’m just dealing.</p>
<p><strong>shill</strong>: What if we both guess wrong? You aren’t gonna
take…</p>
<p><strong>roper</strong>: We got him now! Put down that big bill you
got.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: The fifty or the hundred?</p>
<p><strong>roper</strong>: The hundred! Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: The ace is what I want?</p>
<p><strong>roper</strong>: Sure it is!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Is that okay?</p>
<p><strong>shill</strong>: You’re damn right that’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>dealer</strong>: Whoever finds the ace, wins.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Dark in here.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Too dark. I just can’t see.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Let me borrow these, will you?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Now, that’s better.</p>
<p><strong>roy’s pov</strong>: The glasses are ‘readers.’ Through them,
a large gray ‘A’ can be seen on the back of one of the non-crimped
cards. Roy’s hand reaches out and flips it over. It’s the ace of
spades.</p>
<p><strong>mintz</strong>: I didn’t teach you that.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You taught me a lot. Then I invented.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Let me see how you did that one.</p>
<p><strong>mintz</strong>: Scram. Go home.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I can’t. I just left home.</p>
<p><strong>mintz</strong>: You’re too young. You should be in
school.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I am in school.</p>
<p><strong>mintz</strong>: Where’s the five?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: In your other hand.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy? You asleep?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Myra?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: My God!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Lilly?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Tell the doctor I work for Bobo Justus, and
this is an emergency. Don’t worry, he knows who Bobo is.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Go away, Lilly. Go away.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: The ambulance is on the way, for what good
it will do.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: What? He’s going to be all right!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Mrs. Dillon, your son was in some sort of
accident. He’s had an internal hemorrhage, he’s bleeding to death
inside.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Well, make it stop!</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: His blood pressure is under a hundred. I
don’t think he’ll live to get to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You know who I work for.</p>
<p><strong>doctor</strong>: Yes, yes, but that’s –</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: My son will be all right. If he isn’t, I’ll
have you killed.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Your kid’s in the back here. He’s crying.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy? He’s always crying.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: The kids beat him up, because his home life
is, uh, different.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I like you, too.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Roy, your mother’s here.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: So what’s your story today?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: They twisted my arm.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Only one arm?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: They knocked out my tooth!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Only one tooth?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You always say that!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Come on, kid, let’s see if there’s any food
in the house.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Hah.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: No, really, you’re Roy’s mother? That’s
impossible!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Not quite. But I’m not sure who you are, Mrs…
Langtry, was it?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I’m Roy’s friend.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Yes. I imagine you’re lots of people’s
friend.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Oh, of course, now that I see you in the
light, you’re plenty old enough to be Roy’s mother.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Aren’t we all?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Play nice. Don’t fight.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Darling!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy. You’re going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Sure I am. What made you turn up, after all
these years?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’m working down in San Diego. Just for a few
weeks. Thought I’d drop in on my long-lost son.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Nice to see you. What am I doing in here?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that
bruise you had?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You called the doctor, huh?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, yeah? Thanks. How long do they say I’m in
here?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Roy… Your mom saved your life.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yeah? Only one life?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Second time I gave it to you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I was kind of… inconvenient… for Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Well… You’re all right now, I guess. I have
to get down to the track.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Thanks, uh, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Don’t mention it.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I guess I owe you my life.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You always did.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: “Down to the track?”</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Her job.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I want to know everything about you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You do. And once I’m out of here, I’ll remind
you of the best parts.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You heard the shower, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I don’t care about that. This time, I gotta
have the rent.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by
now, I just need a little more –</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: It isn’t the owner, Myra, it’s my wife. She
knows what’s going on. This time, I gotta have the money.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Joe, you know you’ll –</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: My wife sent me here, Myra. For the money.
She’s waiting.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I’ll have it tonight. Nine o’clock? Ten?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: This time…</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: We’ll work something out, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I don’t see why you’re still here. You look
healthy to me.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I just do what the doctor says, babe.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You’re just comfortable, that’s all. You don’t
even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of
you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Mama!</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth
the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives
you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I’ll pay Lilly back, don’t you worry about
that.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I don’t like to come here, Roy. Every time I
do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s just Lilly’s way.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: And you never defend me. You’re afraid of
her.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, don’t be stupid.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You’re a mama’s boy, if you want the
truth.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Are you kid –? I hadn’t even seen her in seven
years!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Should my ears be burning?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: They might as well.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I heard those skirts were coming back.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Get well soon.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Every day in every way.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I’ll see you when you get home.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What happened to your hand?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Just a little accident. I went by your place,
picked up your mall. Just bills, I’ll take care of them.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I can take care of my own bills, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Whatever you say. The manager says your boss
called. Really pulled the wool over everybody’s eyes, huh?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What are you talking about? So I’ve got a job.
So what?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like
Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You
expect me to believe that?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: It’s there. The boss called, you said so
yourself.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: And that dump you live in! Those clown
pictures on the walls!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I like those.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown
pictures? Commission salesman? It’s all a front, isn’t it? You’re on the
grift, I know you are. You’re working some angle, and don’t tell me
you’re not because I wrote the book!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You’re one to talk. Still running playback
money for the mob.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: That’s me. That’s who I am. You were never
cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you –</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You aren’t tough enough.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Not as tough as you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No. And you have to be.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You asked me about this. You really want to
know what happened?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Up to you.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in
Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on
that horse at the track, because it’s the only way to get the odds
down.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a
nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day
after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna
be.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I
took a chance, and it didn’t work out.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Bluebell came in?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like
it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me. It
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Hi, Bobo.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Did I buy you that dress, you piece of
shit?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Well, I guess so. You’re the guy I work
for.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You work for me, huh? Then I just may flush
you down the toilet. Drive me to the Durando.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Bluebell.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: How’d you figure you were gonna get away with
that?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’m not getting away with anything, Bobo.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You’re fuckin right you’re not. How much did
your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? Or did they give you the same
kind of screwing you gave me?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much
as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those–</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: One question. Do you want to stick to that
story, or do you want to keep your teeth?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I want to keep my teeth.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Now I’ll ask you another. You think I got no
contacts out here? That nag paid off at just the opening price. There
wasn’t hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were
posted. There ain’t enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a
ten grand win! You send me ten thousand dollars, like I’m some mark you
can blow off!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Bobo, no, I –</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You wanna talk to me straight up?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: My son –</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Your what?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: My son was in the hospital –</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: What the fuck are you doin with a son?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: He left home a long time ago. He was in the
hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Motherhood.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I never fucked up before, Bobo.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You expect me to buy this?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You do buy it, Bobo. I cost you, and I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: I got a lot of people work for me, Lilly. I
can’t have shit like this.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: It’ll never happen again. I swear.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: It happened once. With me, that’s making a
habit of it.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You’re calling the shots.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You got any kind of long coat in the car?
Anything you can wear home over your clothes?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: I’ll loan you a raincoat.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Take a walk.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Get me a bath towel.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You ever hear about the oranges?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You mean, the insurance frammis?</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Tell me about the oranges, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: While you put those in the towel.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You hit a person with the oranges in the
towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don’t really get
hurt, not if you do it right. It’s for working scams against insurance
companies.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: And if you do it wrong?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: It can louse up your insides. You can get
puh, puh, puh…</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: What’s that, Lilly?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Permanent damage.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You’ll never shit right again.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Bring me the towel.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Go clean yourself up.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: The raincoat’s on the bed.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Almost forgot. That ten grand of yours. It’s
in the envelope by the door.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Oh, thanks, Bobo.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Gee, I better not, if it’s okay. I still
gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: See your son, huh? Well, that’s nice. A side
of you I didn’t know, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: He’s a good kid. A salesman.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: On the square, huh? And how are you making out
these days? Stealing much?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: From you? My folks didn’t raise any stupid
kids.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Not skimming a thing, Lilly?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here
and a buck there. Not enough to notice.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: That’s right. Take a little, leave a
little.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: A person that don’t look out for himself is
too dumb to look out for anybody else. He’s a liability, right,
Bobo?</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You’re a thousand percent right!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Or else he’s working an angle. If he doesn’t
steal a little, he’s steeling big.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: You know it, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don’t
know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Yeah? You really think so? A lot of people
been telling me the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Well, you can tell them I said they’re right.
I better get going. Roy’ll wonder where I am.</p>
<p><strong>bobo</strong>: Worries about his mother, eh? Give him a hug
for me.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I will. So long, Bobo.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Lucky! Lucky! Oh, am I lucky.! Am I
lucky!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Lucky? You call that lucky?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: He let me live. He let me be his friend.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You don’t put up with that! Nobody has to put
up with that!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You do if you’re where I am. Where you want
to be. How’d you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I tripped over a chair.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Get off the grift, Roy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You don’t have the stomach for it.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I just give you your life. What you do with
it is up to you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Myra here. Sorry you missed me. Tell me how to
reach you and I will, just as soon as I can.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Babe, I’m gettin out of here, and that’s it.
Let’s take some time out this weekend, go down to LaJolla, hit the
beach, have some fun. Forget all this other stuff, huh?</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Your difference between your folded towel and
your clean towel is a trip to the laundry. When you’re cleaning those
bathrooms, what you do, you pick up the towel, you give it a good shake
and a good look, and you say to yourself, ‘Would I dry myself on this
towel?’ If the answer’s yes, fold it.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: What if it’s wet?</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Mr. Dillon! Welcome back! You look fine, just
fine.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Thanks, Mr. Simms, I’m feeling fine.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: I’m glad you’re better.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: You’re well liked around here, Mr. Dillon.
The entire staff will be pleased to see you’re back.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, thank you. And thank them.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Sickness comes to us all, Mister Dillon.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s true, Mr. Simms.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: We never know when and we never know why. We
never know how. The only blessed thing we know is, it’ll be at the most
inconvenient and unexpected time. Just when you’ve got tickets to the
World Series. And that’s the way the permanent waves.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, I’m back now. I just wanted you to know.
Gotta rush.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Happy to see you looking so good.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: That fellow could be a congressman. If it’s
wet, you don’t fold it. You shake it, and hang it neatly on the rod
provided.</p>
<p><strong>maid</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Whadaya say?</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Roy! Welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What’s going on? This is usually coffee break
time.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Not since Kaggs showed up.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Hey, yeah, I’m fine, everything’s great. What’s
this Kaggs? Sounds like a disease.</p>
<p><strong>2nd clerk</strong>: It is.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Troubleshooter from the main office. Came out
here right after you went into the hospital, and he ain’t had a kind
word for anybody yet.</p>
<p><strong>3rd clerk</strong>: Nobody knows anything but him.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: He chopped off half a dozen salesmen; won’t
wholesale to them any more.</p>
<p><strong>2nd clerk</strong>: What kind of sense does that make?
They’re all on commission.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You think he’ll chop me?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: If he does, he’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>2nd clerk</strong>: Here he comes!</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: Kaggs. Home office.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Roy Dillon.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: I know that. Knew it when I saw you out
there. The best salesman here, which isn’t saying much. Want to talk to
you, Dillon.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That was a pretty backhanded compliment. If I
let people get away with things like that, I wouldn’t be a good
salesman.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: You’re right. I apologize. But I still want
to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Lead on.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: Take a seat.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: When I said you being the best salesman here
didn’t say much, I meant for us. I know your record with Sarber and
Webb, and I’d say you’re a top-flight man, but you’ve had no incentive.
No one walking on your heels. Just a lot of half asses, so the
tendency’s been not to stretch yourself. I’m bouncing the slobs,
incidentally.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: So I heard.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: Makes no difference to me if they’re only on
commission. If they don’t make good money, they’re not giving us good
representation, and we can’t afford to have them around. Ever supervise
salesmen?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Just myself.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: That’s right, you’ve had to supervise
yourself. This place needs a sales manager. Somebody who’s proved he’s a
salesman and can handle other salesmen. He’d have a lot of deadwood to
clear out, new men to hire. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Sounds like a good Idea.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: I don’t know offhand what your best year’s
been, we can look it up. The idea is, we’ll top it by fifteen
percent.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What? Me?</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: That’s just the first year. If you aren’t
worth a lot more than that the second year, I’ll kick you out. What do
you say?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, uh… No.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I can’t take that job! I mean, I mean, I can’t
take it right away. I’m still recuperating, I just dropped in to say
hello, see everybody –</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: I didn’t realize. Yeah, you do look a little
pale. How soon will you be ready? A week?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: But you need a man right now. It wouldn’t be
fair to you to –</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: I take care of the being-fair-to-me
department. Things’ve gone to hell this long, they can go a little
longer.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well…</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: See you in a week, Roy. I can call you
Roy?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, sure. Fine.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: And I’m Perk. Short for Percy, I’m
afraid.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Perk.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: This really is it. Union Station.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I don’t see why we have to take the train.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Because it’s comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: What if we want to drive somewhere while we’re
there?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: We’ll rent a car.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Big spender.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You ain’t seen nothin.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Stretch my legs. Come along?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: See you soon.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh! Ow, I’m sorry! Oh, look, I spilled your
drinks!</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: That’s okay, don’t worry about it.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 2</strong>: You okay, pal?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Let me buy you a new round.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Hey, no, no problem.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 3</strong>: You didn’t like spill much at all.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What are those, bloody Marys? Watch this, I’ll
be back.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 3</strong>: Yeah, but it was you like told the
sergeant your grandmother was dead.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: Again!</p>
<p><strong>soldier 2</strong>: And you jumped right in. I’ll drive him,
Sarge, he’s too distraught.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 4</strong>: Distraught? You said distraught?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Boy! You guys could’ve got in a lot of
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 3</strong>: Nah. Old Sarge, he’s slowing down.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I don’t know. I wouldn’t take a chance like
that. What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: One of you fellows drop this?</p>
<p><strong>soldier 2</strong>: You can’t buy every round!</p>
<p><strong>soldier 3</strong>: Like our turn!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Tell you what. We’ll roll for it. Low number
buys.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Go ahead. You roll for the four of you.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 2</strong>: Here goes.</p>
<p><strong>soldier 3</strong>: That’s a four!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Told you I’d buy.</p>
<p><strong>soldier</strong>: It just doesn’t seem fair, Tom.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Tell you what. Give me a chance to get even
when I come back.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Pretty woman like you shouldn’t eat alone.
Whadaya wanna eat alone for?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Go away.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Could I have some coffee, please?</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Right away.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: We could have coffee together. My name’s
Kenny.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Your pal wants you.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Let him find his own pretty woman.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: This fellow bothering you, Ma’am?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: Why don’t you go sit down?</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: I’ll sit here. Move over.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Oh! Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I shouldn’t have hit him that hard. I guess I
don’t know my own strength.</p>
<p><strong>friend</strong>: You didn’t have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I thought I did. You should take better care
of your friend.</p>
<p><strong>drunk</strong>: Outta here.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’m sorry a lady can’t eat in here without
being bothered.</p>
<p><strong>waitress</strong>: It won’t happen again, Ma’am, I promise.
Dinner’s on the house. More chili? Dessert? We have lovely pecan pie, my
husband makes it himself.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: That sounds nice. Pecan pie. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You were right, I had to get out of that
hospital. Nothing wrong with me any more.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I’ll sign that affidavit.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Great to get away, take it easy. Next week,
I’ll get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You already went back to work.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I watched you. Working the tap on those
soldier boys.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Working the what?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Oh, come on, Roy.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: The tap. What you do for a living.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I’m a salesman.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You’re on the grift. Same as me.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Myra, I’m not following this.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Roy, you’re a short-con operator. And a good
one, I think. Don’t talk to me like I’m another square.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You talk the lingo. What’s your pitch?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: The long end. Big con.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Nobody does that single-o.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I was teamed ten years with the best in the
business. Cole Langley.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I’ve heard the name.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: It was beautiful. And getting better all the
time.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: It is, Roy! And now, right now, it’s the
perfect time, the best time since I’ve been in the game.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: All over the southwest, you’ve got these
businessmen, they were making money when everybody was making money,
they think that means they’re smart.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: And now they’re hurting. Everything they had
was because of oil.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: They still got money, but they need more
money, and that’s just the kind of guy Cole and me like.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: When the oil money was good, they put up all
these office buildings, and now they’re half empty.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: They’ll give you anything to move in; first
two months free, redecoration, whatever you want.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: They help you set up the store!</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I’m the roper, I go out and find them and
bring them in. Cole ran the store, and he was the best.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Mary Beth! As beautiful as ever.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I see you brought a friend.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Mister Hebbing is my bodyguard, my strong
right arm. Gloucester Hebbing, may I present my fine stockbroker, Henry
Fellowes.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Mary Beth, what we have here, uh…</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how
brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Mary Beth, I hope you aren’t spreading this
good news too widely.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this
is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything. Wouldn’t I,
darling?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Well, I’ll have to take your word for it, Mary
Beth. Here’s your money.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Goody!</p>
<p><strong>hebbing’s pov</strong>: The top bill in each stack is a
hundred.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Isn’t that just beautiful?</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Henry, next time, couldn’t Mister Hebbing
–</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Mary Beth! This has never been anything but
–</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Oh, I know, I know, and you’ve been wonderful
since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has– – you don’t mind my telling
him, darling – – suffered reverses. If he could…</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: Top up the tanks, as It were. Until this
little glitch in the oil economy comes to an end. Not that I understand
exactly what you do, not from Mary Beth’s explanation.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Well. If Mary Beth vouches for you, and if she
told you the story already…</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: So here we are!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Mister Hebbing, we are talking about breaking
the law here, I want to be sure you understand that. No one gets hurt,
but the law does get broken.</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: Well, that’s what the law’s for, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: And I don’t just mean the SEC. We could have
the FBI breathing down our necks.</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: I certainly hope not.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Loose talk is the one thing I worry about.</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: I can keep my mouth shut, Mister
Fellowes.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Okay, then. Sit down, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: The Tokyo Exchange is nine hours ahead of us,
New York one hour behind. There isn’t one hour of the day when both are
open. Information moves, but it has to wait. Now, we have a young fellow
working here – Do you know what a hacker is, Mister Hebbing?</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: One of those computer geniuses, isn’t
it?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You’re right! And this boy tapped into that
main link between Tokyo and the New York Stock Exchange. He can give us,
when it’s really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of
information. Do you know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: Well, you’ve got your information ahead of
New York, I see that.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Every once in a while, a major change comes
through. We have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our
sell order, into the computer in New York before the Tokyo data comes
in.</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: Not much time.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: We have to be ready. We have to have the
money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to
move immediately.</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: Seven seconds. I don’t see how you do
it.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: These machines – They’re in here.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Want a look?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Oh, Henry, no, that’s just boring.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Come take a look. An entire-suite of
main-frame computer.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: We’re not really interested, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s quite a sight. You sure?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Henry, don’t try Mister Hebbing’s patience. He
knows what machines look like.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Well, if you’re sure.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Cole liked to take risks, huh?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: He didn’t think they were risks. He was so
good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: And when he got serious?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: He’d explain he had to have cash, so there
wouldn’t be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn’t
worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was
one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I thought these people were broke.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings
accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife’s jewelry.
Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I
put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that’s the roper’s job, made
them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: And a month later, the sucker calls the cops
and you’re on the run.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: No no! He never calls the cops, not after we
give him the blow-off.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yeah? How?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Three or four days after Cole got the money,
he’d phone the sucker, tell him he’d made the move.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Our buy was in the computer, we were rich, he
should come collect.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Here you are! Two rich people!</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: I must admit, Mister Fellowes, I had
moments I was worried.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You brought a case? Good.</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Hold it right there!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: What? This is a private office!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: FBI! Stock fraud, tampering with Exchange
communications –</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Oh, my God! No! The scandal!</p>
<p><strong>second man</strong>: Your name?</p>
<p><strong>hebbing</strong>: My –? I don’t I only –</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You! You and your goddamn big mouth!</p>
<p><strong>kyra</strong>: Henry, no, I –</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Who did you tell? Who?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Just one or two of the girls, just, they
wouldn’t –</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Don’t move!</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: Mister Fellowes, that isn’t going to do you any
good. Put that down, and –</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: You ruined me! You destroyed me!</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Henry, no!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Get back! Get back!</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: I’ll kill the first one that follows me!</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in
dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a
year.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What happened to Cole?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: He retired.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Upstate.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Upstate where?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Atascadero.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s where they keep the criminally insane,
isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: No, baby. Not again.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s hollow. You’ll fall through.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Cole, it’ll be all right. Honey?</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Can’t move.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: It’s just the strain again, the stress. We’ll
take a vacation.</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: It’s all hollow. Nothing behind it.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Cole, you scare me when this happens. One of
these times…</p>
<p><strong>cole</strong>: Demon! Demon! That’s why you can walk on it!
Demon!</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What
would I do without you?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: He retired, and that’s it. But I didn’t. I’m
still the best long-con roper you’ll ever see.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I just bet you are, too. And now you’re trying
to rope me.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I’ve
been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or
maybe just…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Take a hike, you mean?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man,
and you’re it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I don’t know, Myra, I never had partners. I
never needed them.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But
how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Think about it. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: See you later.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I still don’t see why we have to have separate
rooms. You expect your father to come through?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay
out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Things a man isn’t supposed to know.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You don’t mind, really, do you, Roy? It’s been
such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Sure. I’m pretty tired myself.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Long con. I’m the one’s been conned. Who needs
this?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Open your door.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What? What for?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Open it and find out.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Gangway!</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I hope you don’t mind, sir. I just washed my
clothes, and I couldn’t do a thing with them.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You – I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: If you could have seen your face when I told
you good night! You looked so, so… Ah!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, come here.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Myra and me come down to LaJolla for the
weekend.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: If you come out to the track, don’t know
me.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: We won’t hit the track. The beach. Couple a
nice restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Four grand. For the hospital. Is that
enough?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy, I don’t want money from you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I pay my debts.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Expecting visitors?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No. That was the point.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You ought to put a bandage on that.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag
too much. Besides, it’ll heal in the air.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy, take that back.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I thought… I was hoping we could play it
straight with one another.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I guess not. You’ll be heading east from here,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: After the meet. Back to Baltimore.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well… nice to see you again, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You, too, Roy.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Prick.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: Here he comes.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I see him.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Wait. Hold it.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: That’s the guy we’re following.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Just wait.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Now we follow her.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You’re the boss.</p>
<p><strong>man’s pov</strong>: The parking area.</p>
<p><strong>myra’s pov</strong>: Foreshortened through the binoculars,
Lilly opens the Chrysler’s trunk, stashes money.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: You stay down real good.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: One of my talents.</p>
<p><strong>blonde</strong>: Your mother’s calling.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Naughty.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Roy! You drown in there?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Be right out!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You were gone for a while.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I went out to Delmar.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: The track? Did you run into Lilly?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I saw her.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: She didn’t see you, in other words.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I’m not trying to make trouble, Roy. It’s
just, she’s always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high
and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in
Baltimore, so now I know who she is.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You must have some very knowledgeable
friends.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I’m well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to
a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Running your broker scam, you mean.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You and me, Roy. What a team we’ll make. We
think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some
slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won’t regret this,
Roy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Regret what? I didn’t say I was coming
aboard.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: But why not? I thought it was settled. What’s
holding you back?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Come on, Myra, don’t talk business here. This
is time out.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You mean, it would be too tough to give me a
turndown here. Easier on home grounds.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yes or no. They’re both easier at home.
Okay?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Whatever you say, darling.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Roy Dillon, Mr. Kaggs.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: Good! Send him in.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: Good to have you back, Roy. I was just
looking at –</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Mr. Kaggs, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: You’re turning me down? Makes no sense,
Roy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I guess I’m just not a leader of men.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: Oh, come on, Roy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: The truth is, Mr. Kaggs –</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: Perk, remember?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things
the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other
activities…</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it
has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can
think about.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Maybe I’m just not ready for that yet.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: Well, Roy, if that’s the way you feel, I
won’t badger you. Don’t want to lose you as a salesman, too.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, I’d like to stay on. Just keep everything
the way it was.</p>
<p><strong>kaggs</strong>: That’s what we’ll do, then. But I tell you
what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I’ll ask you one last time. Fair
enough?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Fair enough.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Darling, guess what? I had to tell you right
away.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: And hello to you, too.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who
plays my chauffeur. There’s a sucker there he says is made for us. And a
boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a
thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves
fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the
sucker into position –</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Wait a minute! When did this happen, that we’re
partners?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: The last I looked, we were just talking things
over.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: But the setup’s there. It’s there now.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I don’t think I need it.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You’re too good for the small-time, Roy. Move
up to where there’s big dough to be made, and you don’t have to stick
your neck out every day.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Maybe I like it where I am.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Well, maybe I don’t! I had ten good years with
Cole, and I want them back! I gotta have a partner! I looked and I
looked and believe me, brother, I kissed a lot of fucking frogs, and
you’re my prince!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Don’t I get any say in this?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: No! Because I –</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s what I say.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What I say is, no. We don’t do partners.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: For Christ’s sake, why not?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Mostly, because you scare the shit out of me.
I’ve seen people like you before, baby. Double-tough and sharp as they
come, and you get what you want or else. But you don’t make it work
forever.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Bullshit!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: No; history. Sooner or later, the lightning
hits. I don’t want to be around when it hits you.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: What is it? What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I’m happy the way I am.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: By God, it’s your mother. It’s Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Sure it is. That’s why you act so funny around
each other.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What’s that?</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Don’t act so goddamned innocent! You and your
own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You watch that mouth.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I’m wise to you, I should have seen it before,
you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like –</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: How do you like this?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s not like me. I don’t do violence.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s why we wouldn’t work together. You’re
disgusting. Your mind’s so filthy, it’s hard even to look at you.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Goodbye, Myra.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: And you don’t even know it.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Mama. It’s Mama. She’s the one.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: You’ll get yours, Mama. Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy! An unexpected pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Lilly, I’ve got a couple things to think about.
Well, kind of job offers, kind of. Different ways to go. I’d kind of
like to talk them out, you know? Maybe just hear myself talk.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up –?
Okay, fine, come on down. It won’t be a home-cooked meal, you know.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, that’s good news.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well? Who’s a boy gonna talk to, if not his
mother?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy?</p>
<p><strong>irv</strong>: Lilly, listen, it’s Irv. You were always decent
with me, I’m taking a hell of a chance here. Somebody blew you out with
Bobo. The car full of money. He’s – Lilly?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: Somebody spooked her.</p>
<p><strong>second thug</strong>: White Chrysler.</p>
<p><strong>thug</strong>: Full of cash.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Thanks a lot, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Evening. Welcome to Phoenix.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Good evening. I’d like a single for
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Oh, everything’s the same size, same
price.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’m a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps
me wide awake all night.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Those trucks. I know exactly what you
mean.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Do you have something around back, facing
away from the road?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’ll put you in one thirty-one. Very quiet.
Faces the desert.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Sounds perfect. I can park my car back
there?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Right in front of the room.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: And I’ll want to leave an early wake-up
call.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: No problem. My husband gets up the crack of
dawn. It’s his kidneys.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Something wrong? I’m sorry. I thought you
were the other lady.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: No. I’m me.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’ll give you one oh seven. That’s a very
nice room, very handy, in the front, right by the pool.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: Oh, don’t you have something around back,
where it’s quieter?</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Everybody wants the back tonight.</p>
<p><strong>myra</strong>: I guess everybody wants privacy.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: Roy Dillon?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: Lieutenant Pierson, Phoenix police. I have
a car here.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: I realize this is a shock.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, mostly, I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: That’s natural.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: No. I mean, I don’t believe it. Lilly is not a
suicide. I know my mother, nothing would make her check out.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: I’m sorry, it was her all right. Her gun,
even.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Gun?</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: I grant you, it’s a little odd, shoot
yourself with a gun with a silencer on it, but it was hers, all right.
It really is your mother, Mister Dillon.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: It may be Lilly, but it isn’t suicide.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: Do you have any particular reason to say
that?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: My mother… Well, I guess it doesn’t matter now.
She worked for gamblers. She always knew they might turn on her some
day.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: A hit, you mean. Honestly, it doesn’t have
that feel to it, but I’ll certainly consider the possibility. Thank you
for telling me.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Not that it matters. This is the morgue?</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: You up to it now?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Sure. Let’s get it over.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: One thing I have to caution you about. A
gunshot wound…</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yes, I know, I know.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: Well, uh, you know, she ate the gun.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: I’m sorry, that’s an unfortunate phrase, it
slipped out, I’m, to tell you the truth, Mr. Dillon, this isn’t an
everyday occurrence around here.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Ate the gun. Oh.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: Someone who knows her well could still
identify her, that’s not the problem. It’s just there’s, uh, it’s likely
to be a shock.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, let’s get the shock over with.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Not many laughs in this room, eh?</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: Not many.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: Remove that. We’ll want a full, uh,
identification.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: No question, huh?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: No, its – Why did she–?</p>
<p><strong>pierson</strong>: That’s that, then.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, yeah. That’s that.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Mom.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: The last modern thing I liked was the
miniskirt. Your technology, now, nobody understands it, and that’s the
simple fact of the situation.</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: Evening, Mizz Langley!</p>
<p><strong>simms</strong>: New things come in here all the time, how do
they work? You can ask your Ph.Ds, your highly educated, intelligent,
professional people, you can say to them, how does that work, and you
know what they’ll tell you? You plug it in. And that’s the way the donut
dunks.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Hello, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Oh! Roy! You scared me.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Going somewhere?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Somewhere else, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I just came back from Phoenix.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Looks very solid, Lilly. Sit down. Take a
minute, tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’ve really got to –</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You’re dead, Lilly, it worked.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint
check.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Why should they? The cops are satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Bobo won’t be. He’ll spend the money to make
sure.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Even so. You still got time. Relax a minute,
tell me what happened. Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Just for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Myra followed you, huh?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: She must have been the one that blew me off
with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my
stash?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No, you wouldn’t. That’s what she was after,
though. But why hit on me?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I wouldn’t go in on a deal with her. She blamed
you for it.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: As though you do what I say.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s pretty funny, all right. What happened
in Phoenix?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy, it was terrible. You read about people
killing people and all that, but when it happens, my God.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: She was in her nightgown, you know, the old
grifter’s dodge, nightgown and the Ice bucket and she just got into the
wrong room by mistake.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I
do now? Run and I’ve got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I
explain?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: This way’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: It is, isn’t it? And maybe it’s a break for
me after all. I’ve been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I’m
out. I can make a clean start, and –</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You’ve already made a start. Doesn’t look that
clean, though.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’m sorry. I hated to take your money, but
–</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Don’t be sorry. You’re not taking it.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I need this, Roy. I can’t run without money,
and if I can’t run I’m dead.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You must have some money.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Just a few bucks.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: And Myra’s stuff?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with
that?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Far enough. Maybe up to San Francisco. Or
St. Louis, someplace new. Start over.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: At what?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You’re smart, Lilly, and you’re good-looking.
You won’t have any trouble finding a job.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: A job? I’ve never had a legit job in my
life!</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, you’re gonna start, if you hope to live
through this. A square job and a quiet life. You start showing up at the
track or the hot spots and Bobo’s boys will be all over you.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy, I know what to do with myself! It’s a
big world out there.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Not any more. Lilly, listen, I’m giving you
good advice. I’m following it myself.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I thought it over, and you were right. You
wanted me out of the rackets, and now –</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy, that’s fine, but I don’t have time for
this. Bobo –</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I thought you’d be happy for me. After all, you
–</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Bobo isn’t after you! Bobo’s after me, and
he’s goddamn good! But so am I. I’m a survivor, Roy. I survive.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I know you do, so that’s why –</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo
knows about the stash in the car, so I didn’t dare touch it, not if
Lilly Dillon’s dead. So that leaves this.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I don’t think so. You probably shouldn’t
either.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No, but I’m goddamn thirsty. Ice water?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Yeah, sure, that sounds nice.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I’ll get it.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Take whichever one you want.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: You wouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You don’t know what I’d do, Roy. You have no
idea. To live.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, you’ll live, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I know what’s bugging you, of course.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh? I didn’t know anything was.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Oh, really? You’ve got a legitimate
complaint, Roy, I don’t deny that. I wasn’t a very good mother when you
were a kid.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Not very good!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: A bad mother. By any standards. I’ve thought
about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I
was.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I wonder did you ever think about it from my
side.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Never.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I
guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a
child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be
a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What do you want me to do? Pin a halo on you?
You’re doing a pretty good job of that yourself.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: And making you feel bad at the same time,
huh? But that’s the way I am, you know, the way I’ve always been. Always
picking on poor little Roy.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: For God’s sake, Lilly!</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I gave you your life twice. I’m asking you to
give me mine once. I need the money.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You’re getting off the grift?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: That’s good. You don’t really belong on this
side of the fence, you know.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I don’t?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: If you stayed a crook, do you think you’d
live to be my ripe age?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: I don’t see why not.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to
me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it
almost killed him.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, uh…</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Sure, sure, that doesn’t count. That’s
different.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Well, it doesn’t matter, does it? I’m getting
out.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: And that’s why you’ve got to get rid of this
money. If you keep it around, it’ll just make you think how clever you
are. It’ll be a temptation to get back into the game.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Oh, that’s it! You’re stealing my money for my
own good! How very motherly of you, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: If I should get out of the racket, that goes
double for you. That’s why you’ve got to change your life completely, go
to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. If you try to
do it your way, what future is in it?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: A future. The only future I’ve got.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: That money wouldn’t last forever. And then
what? You’d be back in some other part of the rackets. Another Bobo
Justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. This way, you’ve
got to go the square route. You could send me a card when you’re
settled, I could maybe help out sometimes…</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: That’s what it is, isn’t it? Keep me down.
Your turn to be in charge, have the power.</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Just trying to help, Lilly.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy… What if I told you I wasn’t really your
mother? That we weren’t related?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: You’d like that, wouldn’t you? Sure you
would. You don’t need to tell me. Now, why would you like it, Roy?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: What’s that all about? Of course you’re my
mother. Of course you are.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Roy… Roy</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: There’s nothing more to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: I have to have that money, Roy. What do I
have to do to get it?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: No? Won’t you give me the money, Roy? Can’t I
change your mind? What can I do to change your mind?</p>
<p><strong>roy</strong>: Lilly, Jesus, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>lilly</strong>: Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at
–</p>
