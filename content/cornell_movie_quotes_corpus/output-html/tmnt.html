<p><strong>splinter</strong>: A sensei once counseled a grief- stricken
boy, as his older brother</p>
<p><strong>plinter</strong>: And more importantly, you are brothers. And
brothers you shall remain, despite time… argument…</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>: LOWER - framing the tops of JUNGLE, moonlit and
surrounded by mist. A mountain range peaks over the horizon.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: ..and even… distance.</p>
<p><strong>super title: some stinking jungle in south america</strong>:
CAM RESTS atop an old CHURCH ROOF. The peaceful scene is suddenly
stopped by a MACHINE GUN BURST! CAM CRANES over the</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>: roof revealing -</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>: N GROUND - A WOMAN VILLAGER is thrown down. Her
SON, 8, runs</p>
<p><strong>woman villager</strong>: You monsters!</p>
<p><strong>pantera</strong>: We appreciate the generous donation for the
continued protection of your village.</p>
<p><strong>pantera</strong>: After all, the jungle can be a very
dangerous place. BAH-HAHAHAHA.</p>
<p><strong>h</strong>: IGH ANGLE - As we watch the jeep from the jungle
ceiling high above… as if from someone’s POV. ON DRIVER - He suddenly
reacts to a fallen tree on the road ahead. Slams on the brakes. Pantera
is thrown around.</p>
<p><strong>pantera</strong>: Idiota! Watch where you’re going!</p>
<p><strong>driver solider</strong>: There’s a log on the road, senor.
…that wasn’t there an hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>pantera</strong>: Well, what are you waiting for?!</p>
<p><strong>remove it!</strong>: Cortez! Andelay!</p>
<p><strong>cortez</strong>: …yirk!</p>
<p><strong>driver solider</strong>: D-d-dios mio.</p>
<p><strong>pantera</strong>: What?! WHAT IS IT?!</p>
<p><strong>oof!</strong>: Burly gets pulled backward… away from the Jeep
and into… the darkness. He SCREAMS the entire way, clawing the ground.
ON JEEP - Driver is freaking out now. Last Soldier is in the back.
Pantera stands up in the jeep. “Last” jumps out and readies his machine
gun.</p>
<p>****: …The Ghost of the Jungle.</p>
<p><strong>pantera</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>driver solider</strong>: I’m sorry, senor.</p>
<p><strong>coward!! get back here!!</strong>: Something suddenly
skitters behind Pantera! He turns to look. Nothing. He reaches down and
pulls up… a MACHETE.</p>
<p><strong>you’re dealing with?!</strong>: ON PANTERA - He circles backs
against the Jungle wall, trying to find him. Tense. Suddenly- -a PAIR OF
WHITE EYES open in the blackness behind him! n a quick series of shots
we see Pantera getting the raw end of a flurry of fist and foot attacks.
His attacker is moving way too fast for the camera to keep up. Pantera
falls back, panting heavily. Panicked. He tears off into the dense
Jungle! ON PANTERA RUNNING THROUGH JUNGLE - Thick foliage. Panicked.</p>
<p><strong>antera</strong>: I am not afraid of a myth!</p>
<p><strong>ttacker</strong>: Actually… it’s “Turtle”, pal.</p>
<p><strong>pantera</strong>: Let’s see if a ghost can die, then.</p>
<p><strong>woman villager</strong>: It’s a miracle!</p>
<p><strong>oy villager</strong>: The Ghost of the Jungle.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: My training is now complete.</p>
<p><strong>freeeze! stop or we’ll shoot!</strong>: Shoes belong to a
panicked MUGGER, early 20’s, as THREE NYPD OFFICERS clamor after him.
The Mugger is a jackrabbit - hopping newspaper machines, rolling under
passing trucks and doing anything he can to avoid arrest. ventually the
NYPD peter out. The mugger looks back. Smiles.</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Heh, heh… suckers.</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Whaaa!!!</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: You crazy?! Put me down, man!</p>
<p><strong>ow! hey! what’re you-ow!! oof!</strong>: Just as it looks
like he’ll hit a telephone pole… Driver veers left! He drags the Mugger
into…</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Wh-wh-what kinda freak are you?!</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: P-p-please. Don’t kill me, man.</p>
<p><strong>mugger</strong>: Wh-wha-wha-WHAT ARE YOU DOI- AAAGH!</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: HAM! - Driver nails the dagger through the
Mugger’s JACKET, PINNING HIM TO THE WALL. Driver turns around to gather
the purse’s belongings at the mouth of the alley. fter he stops
cringing, the Mugger wriggles the blade out of the wall. Driver doesn’t
notice as - THWIP-IP-IP! - he hurls the knife at the Driver! THUNK! It
sticks in the DRIVER’S BACK! N MUGGER - His grinning eyes suddenly GO
WIDE as Driver slowly turns around, UNHURT! The Mugger is trapped as
Driver moves toward him… and a BOLO CHAIN drops to his side. ON WALL
SHADOW - as we see a flurry of punches, kicks and throws as Driver lays
a beating on the criminal who needs to be taught a lesson. An OS Police
Siren chirps. MOUTH OF ALLEY - The police suddenly show up, cherries
flashing. They run to FG, mouths drop.</p>
<p><strong>nypd #1</strong>: …whoa.</p>
<p><strong>nypd #2</strong>: The Nightwatcher.</p>
<p><strong>nightwatcher?“</strong>: WIDER - A quieter area of the city.
Broken by the squealing of the bike as Driver roars in to a stop.
Nightwatcher drives underneath a TRAIN BRIDGE. He takes off his helmet.
Red cloth spills out. He turns around as we see-</p>
<p><strong>- raphael, the red-masked ninja turtle!</strong>: He reaches
back and pulls out the KNIFE from his SHELL. Looks at it, shaking his
head and grinning. He sheathes it.</p>
<p><strong>aphael</strong>: Heh, heh. Nice try, chump.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Dude… I’m scared!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: CLOSE ON - A PAIR OF TURTLE EYES…
MICHAELANGELO’S! They’re wide with FEAR. Nervously darting around,
unable to keep up with the surrounding danger.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Dude! They’re all around me! What do
I do? WHAT DO I DO?!</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Just relax, Mikey. Remember your
training. You’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: But I need back up this time,
man!</p>
<p>****: …you’re such a prima donna.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Okay -
waita-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA-WHOA!!</p>
<p><strong>screaming kids</strong>: Get him! Yeah! You suck! Hey!
Awright! Take that, Turtle-dork!</p>
<p><strong>hey! not below the-oooff!! ow!!</strong>: End WIDER with the
kids all walking away from Mikey, now on the floor doubled over from the
“playing”. A beat, then- -one more kid runs back and kicks Mikey.</p>
<p><strong>keeeeya!</strong>: This was the best birthday ever,
Mommy!</p>
<p><strong>occer mom</strong>: Thanks so much. You’re worth every penny.
I have to tell all my friends about you. You’ll love their kids too.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: I can only hope they’re as lovely as
the rugrats you got here.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Such… angels.</p>
<p><strong>soccer mom</strong>: Okay! Everyone say good-bye to Cowabunga
Carl! BYE!</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Hyuk! Cowabunga dudes! Bye!</p>
<p><strong>bye!!!!!!</strong>: ON DOOR - As the door closes and Mom
turns back, a green hand reaches in quickly a grabs a box of pizza. The
door closes.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Heheh… score.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Hey, hey, hey… don’t forget the face
thing.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Yes… sir.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: That’s a good boy.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: All’s I’m saying Donnie is that no
one would notice if YOU did one of these gigs every now and again.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: But you add such… panache to the
character.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Well, if panache is French for
“punching bag”, I’d have to agree with ya.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Close enough. I - uh-oh-</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: -you got a peeping tom.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Aw nuts.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Just get me outta here, dude.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Traffic’s clear eastbound for two blocks.
Then hook up with route J.</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: Righteous.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: along with his gaining speed.</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: You HAD to install the music too…</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: All part of the cover, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Honeeeeey! I’m hooome!</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: behind him revealing the LAIR. Breathtaking to
fresh eyes. t has a wonderful lived-in feel - they’re not squatters…
they’ve made this their HOME. Furniture is jury-rigged and the place is
custom lit to provide the right kind of atmosphere. If we looked behind
the surface detail, we’d see a mesh of wires and circuitry powering the
entire lair. Donatello runs up to Mikey. Mikey robotically hands him the
wad of money from the party.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Moneymoneymoneymoney.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Domo arigato, dude.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo!</strong>: Mikey springs from the couch. Snaps
to obedience.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Yes, sensei.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Well?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Sensei? Oh! Here ya go, Master
Splinter.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Ahh! Butter creme frosting!</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Master. No cake. You remember your last
cholesterol tests.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: But I- -Donatello! I am your Master!</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Nice try, sensei. But you can still be my
Master… with low cholesterol.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: He-heh. You have done well, my son.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Careful! That isn’t some box full of
fish!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p>****: Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Hey. It’s me. I’m back.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Was that today, babe?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Yes. It was today that I returned to you
after being in a deadly jungle for almost a month.</p>
<p>****: I thought you were going to meet me down here?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: I’m sorry, babe. I must’ve-</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Forget it. I’ll take a cab.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: I missed you?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Good goin’, Case.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Howie! Get this on the truck for delivery!
Let’s go!</p>
<p><strong>i’m! bored!!!!!</strong>: He stands up and walks to DON’S
ROOM. He opens it. It takes only one foot until the door is pushed up
against piles of TECH JUNK. Mikey uses his shoulder and pushes it open.
N DON - He’s hunched over a work table, back to Mikey. Tinkering as
always. Wild inventions line the walls, some finished, some not. Some
pay tribute to past TMNT adventures.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Don, y’ever feel like you were meant
for more? To DO more? Like, I mean, sometimes I feel like…</p>
<p><strong>onatello</strong>: Oh, hi Mikey. You say something?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Every day it’s the same thing. Wake
up. Birthday party gig. Drive home. Watch TV. Train… Rinse. Repeat.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: I know. Isn’t it great?</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Michaelangelo. Boredom is never an
indicator of your surroundings. It is a reflection of your inner heart.
Fill yourself with excitement on the inside… and you’ll live the most
rewarding life of all.</p>
<p><strong>nyc dirt reporter</strong>: And so yet again, police
officials are baffled at a crime of retribution that can only be
attributed to the mysterious figure</p>
<p><strong>nyc dirt reporter</strong>: This is the latest in a string of
vigilante acts that have been plaguing the city for the past year.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Now THAT’S what I’m talking about!
Cruising the streets, busting those who hold themselves above the law.
But they aren’t above HIS.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Mikey, the man’s practically a criminal
himself. Anyone who operates without boundary or rule of law cannot be
legislated and needs to be reigned in.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Sounds like four turtles I used ta
know.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Whatta we talkin’ about, boys? Soundin’ a
little too egghead fer my tastes.</p>
<p><strong>plinter</strong>: Ah, Raphael. Your brothers and I were just
discussing the vigilante Nightwatcher once again. Where have you been?
You’ve been spending so much time away from home lately…</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I joined a book a’ the month club. So just
what’s your beef with puttin’ dirtbags behind bars, Donnie? Go ahead…
enlighten me.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: I have no problem with the incarceration
of those who deserve it, but if someone like Nightwatcher has ultimate
power… then who makes sure he doesn’t cross the line?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: I think he’s COOL.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Of course you would.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Keeya! HATCHAAAAAA!!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Sometimes there are lines that even the
police can’t cross. Someone has to be willing to do what needs to be
done. And to do that, fear becomes a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: You are such a Neanderthal.</p>
<p><strong>aphael</strong>: I rest my case.</p>
<p>****: Raphael! If bullying is the only way to argue your point, then
perhaps you do not have much of a point to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>aphael</strong>: Yes, sensei. And quit touchin’ my stuff.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: That was just a startle response and
isn’t really an indication of fear!</p>
<p><strong>stereo too, mikey!!!</strong>: Then HEAVY ROCK starts playing
to drown out his family. A silence sits in the room as a CD flies out of
Raph’s room. Tense in the room for a bit. Don looks at the other
two.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: It’s an involuntary thing your body does
when stimulated like that. What? It’s true.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Mmm… home sweet home.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Enter.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: I have completed my training, master. I am
prepared for the next stage.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: That you are, my son. You must now apply
all that you have learned on your lengthy journey to your everyday life.
THAT will be the most challenging training of all…</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: I’ve missed you, Leonardo.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: eo hugs Splinter.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: I’ve missed you too, father.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: I’m afraid much has changed in your
brothers’ spirits since you have left. But now that you are home, they
will finally have the ethical and warrior leadership they have been
lacking. The family needs you.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Heh. Yeah… I mean, yes sensei.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Raphael, your brother is home.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: So… congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Well, I’m goin’ to bed.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Leo’s home.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Leo!!</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: But I don’t WANNA pop out of the
birthday cake, Mrs. Ro-</p>
<p><strong>leooooo!!!</strong>: Mikey flips past Donnie and slams Leo
with a gripping HUG… and doesn’t let go.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Hey little bro! Mikey? You can let go now…
um, Mikey?</p>
<p>****: So bored… so bored…</p>
<p><strong>fade to black</strong>: VER BLACK - Quick bursts of AUDIO
VIOLENCE. Steel, screaming, trampling, and rumbling. Then- -with each
audio burst, we now see a VISUAL BURST. Strong, rim-lit, iconic images
of an IMMENSE BATTLE - a slicing blade weapon, screaming mouth, angry
eyes. Then- -a monster claw! Gnashing teeth! Scared eyes! Horns and
tusks! The edit gets intense, until -</p>
<p><strong>inters assistant</strong>: Mr. Winters, sir.</p>
<p><strong>winters assistant</strong>: It’s time for your morning
workout.</p>
<p><strong>winters assistant</strong>: Mr. Winters, sir?</p>
<p><strong>winters assistant</strong>: The board is waiting.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Tell them I’m on my way down.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: inters’ Elevator Office lowers into a balcony
level building overseeing the main lobby. He walks down a stairwell and
through the lobby, five Assistants following him.</p>
<p><strong>inters</strong>: Gentlemen! Let’s begin.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Leo… what’s up, bro?</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Just enjoying being home.</p>
<p><strong>control!</strong>: Mikey and Leo COUGH, leave the smokey
area.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Say, what’s up with April and Casey? I
expected them to drop by after I got back.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: We don’t see much of `em anymore.
April seems to be working a lot - eww - and Casey seems to be, I dunno,
“different” lately. Maybe he doesn’t like having to put the toilet seat
down now that they’ve moved in together.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: They’re living together now?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: To be honest with ya, they’re kinda
buzzkills to be around.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Is Casey at least still doing his hockey
mask thing?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Dunno. Haven’t noticed since The
Nightwatcher has come home to roost. WOOOOHOOOOOOOO!</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: “Nightwatcher”? That some new comic book
you’re hooked on, Mikey?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: This should explain most of it. The legacy
of the city’s newest hero. Compliments of the fanboy over there. M</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: Joke all you want, Raphy. But train
hard and eat your veggies and one day, you too can be as cool as The
Nightwatcher, dude.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I can only hope, Mikey. I can only
hope…</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: This guy could bring heat on all of us if
he keeps this up. Showboating isn’t a replacement for justice… it’s just
self-indulgence. Someone needs to talk to this thug.</p>
<p><strong>id 1</strong>: Yo, Case? Wanna be goalie?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Nah, you know I work for a livin’. It’s Star
Center or nothin’ else.</p>
<p><strong>kid 2</strong>: Whatever! Let’s get it on!</p>
<p><strong>thomas!</strong>: Tommy’s defeated. Looks at the disappointed
boys.</p>
<p><strong>tommy</strong>: Sorry dudes.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Busted! Have fun with your mommy… …oh no.</p>
<p><strong>asey</strong>: Aw, c’mon April! We just started!</p>
<p><strong>kid 2</strong>: Can’t Casey stay and play for just five more
minutes, Miss O’Neil? Pleeeeeeease?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Not today, Nate. Mister Jones has to pretend
to be an adult for a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>kids</strong>: Awwwww! Man! Baaah!</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Later boys!</p>
<p><strong>pril</strong>: I need your help with a delivery.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Do you need my funtahstick muscles?</p>
<p>****: Heh-heh… yeah.</p>
<p><strong>receptionist</strong>: Mr. Winters. April O’Neil is here.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Miss O’Neil. You are a vision. Thirty days
in a jungle, and beautiful as ever.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Hello Max.</p>
<p>****: This is my… friend, Casey Jones.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Chris! How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Actually, It’s Ca-</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: So how was your trip?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You know, the typical - corrupt government
officials, double crossed by a jungle guide, all ending in a
heart-pounding chase.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: But it was all worth it. I found it. The
fourth General.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Yeah-ha! The fourth General.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: The crow-bar.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>****: …the gods be praised.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Can I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>y</strong>: es. Of course.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I’ve been so grateful for the opportunities
you’ve given me lately. I’d probably be still selling antique curios if
you hadn’t visited my shop that day. But I have to ask… why the
fascination with these particular works of art? I’d never even heard of
the Legend of Yaotl until we met.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: It was a time long before the Mayans,
April. Long before the Aztecs and even the Olmecs. It was a time of
legends. A time of greatness. The true mother culture of Central
America.</p>
<p><strong>inters</strong>: There was a man named Yaotl. More a force of
nature than man. And together with his Four Warrior- Priest Generals,
they pillaged every culture in their path.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: And for every culture they destroyed, they
drank in all the magic and knowledge known to them.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Then they came across a culture rich with
science, magic and their own technology. A South American version of
“Atlantis”.</p>
<p>****: It was like blood in the water for a predator like Yaotl.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: As the army approached, Yaotl used the
knowledge they’d gained in black magic and sorcery. Timing their attack
with the alignment of the Stars of Kikin, they opened a portal to
another world.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: They unleashed an army of monsters.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: The monsters knew no side - they destroyed
the enemy… as well as Yaotl’s own army. Men who swore to spill their
blood for his cause. Yaotl had to do something to stop more from coming
through.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: inters SMASHES the portal, stopping the slew of
monsters from pouring out. End on a scream. Dissolve to LATER in the
battle…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: In the end, there were no victors. And they
were responsible for the eradication of the greatest culture that will
never be known. The knowledge that was lost would never be found
again…</p>
<p><strong>dissolve back to present day in winters’ office</strong>:
Casey has fallen asleep, sitting to the side, head in his hand. A line
of DROOL hangs from his mouth. April is fascinated by the story. She
nudges Casey who does the slurp/half-snore wake up.</p>
<p><strong>asey</strong>: I was just resting my eyes…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Quite the story, Max. You don’t think that
this could be-</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Oh no, Miss O’Neil. Like you said… just a
story.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: One of the girls will pay your fee on the
way out.</p>
<p><strong>pril</strong>: Thanks. Um… goodbye… Max.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: What!? It was a boring story!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: That is so perfectly CASEY JONES. I give you
opportunity. I give you the chance to become a better man. And what do
you do with it?</p>
<p><strong>you fall asleep!</strong>: Casey stops next to a PODIUM
holding a priceless-looking VASE. As he speaks, he gestures very
animatedly and dangerously close to the vase.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Well, maybe if you were home for more than
four days at a time, you’d see that I DON’T WANT ANY OF</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Casey, you better be careful-</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Here I am nice enough to help you out, dress
in this get-up and all I get is grief?!</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Oh boy.</p>
<p><strong>over the glass entry. completely encloses the front
lobby.</strong>: Room is now emergency light RED. April rubs her
temples.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Give me strength.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You can come out now.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: woman - dressed in cloak and Japanese Noh mask
over her face. he takes it off, revealing KARAI - the beautiful leader
of the Japanese Foot Clan, flanked by three, FOOT NINJAS.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Your talents are commendable.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: As are yours. Most don’t notice us until we
decide they will.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Well, I guess I’m just special that
way.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: So down to business - aside from the other
reasons for your visit to America, are you interested in my offer we
discussed?</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: I must confess… I still don’t know exactly
what we are to do for you.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I need the finely-tuned eyes and stealth of
your Foot Ninja to… monitor the city for me over the next few days.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Just keep your eyes peeled for anything…
strange.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: What kind of strange things?</p>
<p><strong>waaaaaaaaaahhh!!!!</strong>: Gave me a scare kitty.</p>
<p><strong>c</strong>: AM LOWERS further through the asphalt, then
quickly hooks up with an air duct pipe. Zips faster and faster until
we’re in-</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Does ANYBODY train anymore?!</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Just a sec, dude! I’m almost at level
eighteen. Scratch that… seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: In… uh… a few minutes, Leo. I’m in the
middle of-</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Um… make that another hour.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: A true leader knows how to motivate his
troops regardless of their own motivations.</p>
<p><strong>turtles</strong>: Aw man! What’s goin’ on?! WHO</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Ninja tag, topside!</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: First one to touch old faithful over
there-</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: -does the other team’s chores for a
week.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo/raphael</strong>: Deal.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: I’m with Leo!</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Actually, I think you and I should pair
up, Mikey.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: You kiddin’ me?! I mean, no offense
Donnie, but you ain’t exactly the biggest hitter on the bench.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Just trust me on this one.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Have you been avoiding me? Barely seen you
since I got home.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I been busy.</p>
<p>****: I see. So… you’re definitely not upset at me or anything,
right?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Why’d you think that?</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: I don’t know… your brother gets to go on a
world-wide training mission and you have to stay home. Might upset me
too.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Are you trying to make me mad?</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: I’m just saying, I’d understand if you
were upset.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: You wouldn’t understand the first thing
about me, daddy’s boy - OOF!.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Is that what this is about? You think
Splinter likes me best?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: You’d love that, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: So nice of you to join us,
gentledudes.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: And by the way, I prefer the classic
military corner tuck for my bedsheets.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: ikey and Don high five. Leo and Raph aren’t
amused. They stare down. Raph does his BULLY FLINCH fake-lunge… only Leo
doesn’t twitch. Suddenly-</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Whoa! Whawazzat?!</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: You dudes see that up there?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: So what now, captain?</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: We need to come up with a plan.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Later!</p>
<p><strong>raph!!!</strong>: But Raph doesn’t stop. All three look at
each other. Then-</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Welcome home.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Guys, I’ve got a bad feeling…</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Ahh, let’s take a tiny peek.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Well, there’s a good/bad news
scenario for ya.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Good news is that there are a buncha
Foot Ninja gettin’ the snot kicked out of `em.</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: Bad news is WHAT’s kickin’ the snot
out of `em…</p>
<p><strong>onatello</strong>: An interesting conundrum. Do we hold dear
the value of life and help the Foot regardless of our tumultuous
past?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: I vote for sitting back and enjoying
the show. Whaddaya say, leader boy?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Nah. We kick butt.</p>
<p><strong>eonardo</strong>: Who are YOU?!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Nice of ya’s ta join me.</p>
<p><strong>yeeeaaaaargghhh!!!!!</strong>: The creature stops. Confused.
So are the other three turtles.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: What? I saw it on a nature show
once.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: NGLE ABOVE TURTLES - As a large teetering pallet
filled with dried cement and blocks to come CRASHING DOWN ON THEM! The
Turtles are buried under the rubble. RUH? - The Creature is confused…
until it’s hit with a blinding light, and then an EXPLOSION - FWOOM! We
hear heavy footsteps thumping through the light. Shapes start to form
until we see… …LIVING VERSIONS OF THE FOUR STONE GENERALS! Sporting HIGH
TECH GEAR - a mix of tech with ancient magic scrawlings. Their bodies
“glow” with a red inner life, seeping through their stone cracks and
piercing eyes. The Generals are all ANIMAL-THEMED - Mute and powerful
Ape- themed costume , Eagle Leader , agile Jaguar and the deadly
snake-like female . Large. Imposing. Completely bad-ass. The Creature
ROARS and FIGHTS to no avail…</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Better hit the tunnels, guys.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Raph. Save it for another day.</p>
<p><strong>raph!</strong>: Raph knows he has to go. Reluctantly he
enters the sewer. The lid closes as the alley is illuminated by POLICE
CHERRIES.</p>
<p><strong>a</strong>: beat, then Mikey barely pops the lid open for
another peek.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Y’know, it’s not that bad, dudes.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What seems to be the problem?</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: The “problem” is that we were hired to merely
patrol the city and report anything “strange” to you.</p>
<p><strong>monsters.</strong>: Winters smirks, looking at the mouse who
thinks he can take the lion. He reaches to a satchel on the floor. The
Foot TENSE in anticipation. Instead… Winters comes up with a</p>
<p><strong>inters</strong>: So, your job duties were just redefined.
Congratulations on your promotion.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: We may be hired help to you, but you should
never forget… we are the Foot Clan.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Oooooooh…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: I believe we made a deal, Karai. I expect
you to honor it. You do understand “honor”, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: So I don’t care what part of “muscle for
hire” you don’t understand. I hired your muscle. Now exercise the ones
attached to your feet and… …get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: a Foot Ninja. Then another to a second Ninja.</p>
<p><strong>inters</strong>: So I will double… no, no… TRIPLE your pay
for your troubles. Are we cool?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Are we… cool?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Ninjas. No sense of humor. So how did we
fare?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: So it begins…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Were there any problems?</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: None, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You see, now THAT’S a good soldier. You two
should compare notes.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: Just what is this all about?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Oh, let’s call it a scavenger hunt. I now
have the power and know-how, but I need the speed and stealth of an
organization such as your own. Not to mention an organization that
values discretion.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: But of course.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: You see, I have nine more beasts like this
that should be coming to town very soon. Thirteen in all, to be
exact.</p>
<p><strong>arai</strong>: But… why? Why here? Why now?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Instinct, mostly. They’re animals at their
core. And they recognize something familiar in the air… in the
stars.</p>
<p>****: What can I say? I’m a lover of animals.</p>
<p><strong>w</strong>: we don’t fully see. Glowing eyes pierce out of
the darkness.</p>
<p><strong>inters</strong>: So you go and get to know each other. And
don’t forget… play nice.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: Not now. Our business will be handled at a
later time…</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Dudes, did anyone get the license
plate of the thing that hit us last night? Oi, my head…</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Was it just me, or did that creature look
familiar?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: We coulda taken it if you slackers woulda
pitched in sooner.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Fact remains, Raph, that we should have
never been there in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>aphael</strong>: Well, I suppose that we shoulda let
Mr. Cuddly-kins continue to spread happiness throughout the city… oh
wait… HE WAS A FREAKING MONSTER TRYIN’ TA KILL US!!! Good call, fearless
leader.</p>
<p><strong>onatello</strong>: Come to think of it, it WAS pretty strange
to see the Foot too. And who was that woman?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: I dunno, but she sure gave Leo a run
for his money.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: This is my fault now, Raph? I’m the only
one who has to be responsible!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Hey, you’re the “trained master”, not
me.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Dudes-can-it-here-comes-Splinter.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Good morning, my sons.</p>
<p><strong>turtles</strong>: Morning, sensei.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: If anyone needs me, I’ll be watching my
stories.</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: plinter walks out. OS sound of the TV being
turned on. At the table, the glare continues.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Hothead.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Splinter-junior.</p>
<p><strong>nyc dirt reporter</strong>: And in the latest of a string of
strange criminal activity, a construction site was nearly destroyed last
night. Authorities believe a violent battle had taken place earlier that
evening.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: My sons, what-</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: I believe you boys have some explaining to
do…</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Leonardo, I am most disappointed in you.
You are the leader of your brothers. I was counting on you to bring
order to the chaos of this family.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: But Master Splinter, how can I be expected
to do so when Ra-</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: There are no excuses when you are the
Leader, my student.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: But the involvement of the Foot and their
mysterious leader worries me.</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: I’m personally worried about a monster
running around the streets of New York. But hey, that’s just me.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: We hafta go out and find who’s responsible
for this. There ain’t no other solution.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Raphael, there are better ways to use your
skills in ninjitsu. Fact- gathering. Analysis. Observation. Direct
contact should only be your last resort.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Wow, sounds… exciting.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Save the brute vigilante junk for that
Nightwing guy.</p>
<p><strong>mikey/raph</strong>: “Nightwatcher”.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>o</strong>: N BIKE - Explodes out of a BACK ALLEY and into
the night.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: You sure you don’t want to spar a bit?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Nah. Ever since you started with the blade
weapons you, um… you kinda scare me.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Suit yourself. Case?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p>****: Are you happy? I mean, with your life. With me.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Yeah. Sure. You?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: I’m going outside for some air.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Be safe.</p>
<p><strong>it again! i’m sorr-ooof!</strong>: BAM! - the leather fist of
Nightwatcher slams Burglar back, tripping over an A/C duct. He tries to
shield himself- REVERSE ANGLE - BOOM! - Nightwatcher lands in the
FG.</p>
<p><strong>ightwatcher</strong>: Funny how you jerks don’t care about
crossing the line `til someone else does it… all over yer HEAD!</p>
<p><strong>nightwatcher</strong>: Boy, oh boy, did YOU pick the wrong
night to be a criminal…</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Hey champ. You think you’re being a little
rough on the guy?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Are you that Nightwatcher fella? A little
smaller than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Case? No way!</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: I’m talkin’ to you, pal. You think you own
these rooftops? Well, lemme teach you a thing’r two. Class is Pain 101.
Meet your instructor… Casey Jones.</p>
<p>****: You keep on playing with fire, little man, you might just get
burnt.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Raph?! Is that you?! What-what are you
doing?!</p>
<p>****: Are you pretending to be…</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Why would you- -oh. So that would mean…</p>
<p><strong>-ooohhhhhh!</strong>: Raph smiles… the first genuine one he’s
had in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I dunno, I just got tired of the “nothing”.
Sitting around waiting for some disaster to cross our paths. Of us
battling Utroms and Triceratons or any other friggin’ creature… when
there was still some guy gettin’ mugged 100 feet above the lair. Just
didn’t seem right. `Specially if we had the means to do somethin’ about
it.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: And we did… but turns out I was the only
one who was willing to do it, tho. So I just saved up, bought and
tweaked a sweet bike, fitted the costume and began moonlighting.</p>
<p>****: Papers called me “The Nightwatcher”, so I went with it.</p>
<p><strong>asey</strong>: “And a legend was born”. So what was your
handle before that?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I kinda liked “The Midnight Marauder”…</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Stick with Nightwatcher, ninja boy.</p>
<p>****: The guys ever catch on?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Pfft. You kiddin’ me? Leo’s been away for,
like, forever. And the other two are so wrapped up in that party
business they’d never notice.</p>
<p>****: So what about you? How’s things with April? Haven’t seen ya’s
since you two moved in together…</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: They’re good… I guess. I dunno, seems like
all I do lately is just make her upset. She used to laugh so much… now
it’s mostly just working all day, and coming home to point out how I’m a
screw up. She doesn’t like me doing this. And I know she’s pretending to
not know I’m out tonight. But she knows. And she knows I know she knows.
Life just kinda got complicated suddenly… y’know?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Yer tellin’ me…</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Raph?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Nice to see ya, man.</p>
<p><strong>casey/raphael</strong>: What was that?!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: For old time’s sake?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: What the shell.</p>
<p>****: Bro. Seriously.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: I think we lost it.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: It’s gotta be around here somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>waaaaaaaaaaaggghhhh!!!!!!!!</strong>: It’s about to attack
when - THUNKA-THUNKA-THUNKA - it’s drilled with TRANQUILIZER DARTS from
below! CHOOOM! - A grappling hook winds around its feet. The Creature
struggles but is pulled down hard!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Did I mention we ran into a monster last
week?</p>
<p><strong>about that one, buddy!</strong>: They inch closer to the
edge. Peek over. ON ALLEY - See the Four Generals putting a pounding on
the Creature. They subdue it with all their hardware. The Foot stand
guard, helping in the BG.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: The freakin’ FOOT?! What about the walking
statues? Were you going to mention THOSE?!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Nope. Those are a first for me too. We can
take `em.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: On second thought…</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: HINK! - Casey accidentally knocks a tiny piece of
rock from the ledge. It falls down - CLANG! - on a garbage can lid.</p>
<p><strong>eneral gato</strong>: Witnesses.</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: Fetch.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Not good.</p>
<p><strong>nightwatcher</strong>: You ever heard of smoke pellets?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Hey - you’re the ninja, not me!</p>
<p><strong>what were those things, raph?!</strong>: Raph ignores him,
looking for a street sign. Then he sees it - 56th Street.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Bingo.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: What are we gonna do, Raph? WHAT</p>
<p><strong>are we gonna-</strong>: -hey, cool ride.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Hop on.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Um, Raph?</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: hisiscrazythisiscrazythisiscrazy.</p>
<p><strong>that’s what i thought, punk!</strong>: …and then
-thumpthumpthump- Gato JUMPS DOWN TOWARD THEM!</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Oh crap.</p>
<p><strong>asey</strong>: Okay, so it was great seein’ ya again,
Raph.</p>
<p>****: Raph?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Gotta get you someplace safe, pal. And then,
then I need to go buy some new undies.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Casey, I think we need to talk. I don’t want-
whoa.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Could use a little… help here…</p>
<p>****: Hey April… how ya been?</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: My compliments to zee chef.</p>
<p>****: Le brrrraaaaaaapp!</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Anyone for dessert?</p>
<p><strong>no!!</strong>: The phone suddenly rings. Don rushes over to
the jury-rigged payphone on the wall.</p>
<p><strong>cowabunga-carl-party-services-</strong>: Cowabunga-dude.
Waita-slow down April. What happened to Raph?</p>
<p>****: We’ll be right there.</p>
<p><strong>m</strong>: and Casey. Mikey looks around.</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: Whoa… I am in the wrong line of work.
Nice pad, kids.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: His vital signs seem to be okay. Pupil
dilation is normal.</p>
<p>****: Get the… frig offa me.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Temper is normal too. He’s going to be
fine. Health-wise, I mean. Otherwise, he’s still the same old Raph.</p>
<p>****: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Some sort of stone… probably obsidian, I
think.</p>
<p>****: There’s an engraving on it. Looks… South American. Aztec?
No. It’s definitely not Mayan.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: It can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: What can’t be, April?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Would it help things if I said that we were
being chased by a one of those statues you collected for that Winters
guy?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: I’d say that’s a big ten-four.</p>
<p>****: It’s just a myth… a legend.</p>
<p>****: It can’t be.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: And I suppose that bringing up the
thirty-foot flying monster would probably just push this over the edge,
huh?</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: What are you talking about Casey?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Just some story this Winters guy told us. It
all started down in South America. Long before the Ashmecks and the
Macaroons.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Azteks and Mayans.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: That’s what i said.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Sit down, Jones. So there was this guy call
Yaotl…</p>
<p><strong>dip to black:</strong>: Everyone is gathered around as April
finishes. Mikey, in particular, is hunched over, intent. Casey, like
before, has fallen asleep. Silence for a beat. Then-</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Well?! WHAT NEXT?!!!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: No one knows. The legend stops there.</p>
<p>****: But it’s just a legend.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: The micro-tech of this dart is
astounding. The molybdenum is of a grade only found in a few select
markets… not to mention it’s current stock is going for a little more
than two-grand an ounce right now.</p>
<p><strong>eonardo</strong>: So what do we have? We have someone with a
lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>onatello</strong>: Access to technology… and the means to
produce it to exact specs.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Not to mention having a keen interest in
these monsters… and them four stone jokers.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: If you ask me, it all somehow points to
Winters Corp.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: How do you figure that, Donnie?</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Hello? “Genius”? Well, that, and the fact
that this part has a Winters Corporation logo on it.</p>
<p><strong>eonardo</strong>: Do you think he’s trying to recreate the
events from back then?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Well, what would you do with an army of
monsters?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Well, aside from having your own
wrestling league, I dunno… MAYBE</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Do bad guys still try to do that?</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Yes, however they’re usually mortgage
re-fi companies.</p>
<p>****: What about it, April? You just finished working with the guy,
right? Does it make sense?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Guys! It’s a legend!</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Is that “legend” like the ginormous
freakin’ hairball that attacked us?</p>
<p><strong>aphael</strong>: Or “legend” like the moving statues and
flying creature that attacked me n’ Casey?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Okay. Fine. I’ll help for now… until we prove
you’re all insane.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Or until we prove Winters is up to
something more than collecting art.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: I’ll work with April and see if these
Stars of Kikin she told us about can give us any clues.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I say we just storm the castle and face
this jerk in person!</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Raph, that would be the worst idea yet. We
hang back. Analyze. Formulate a plan, THEN storm your castle. Are we
clear?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Raph. Don’t do it, man.</p>
<p>****: I spent my whole life running out of rooms ticked off at the
world. I wish I could take most of `em back. Sometimes, just takin’ a
breather is the best thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Yeah… whatever.</p>
<p><strong>pril</strong>: Think this is all of them, Donnie.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I cleaned out my archives on ancient South
America. Might have found something useful.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: A map of the stars, as recorded by an Aztec
Shaman. They pinpoint the location of the Stars of Kikin… even though
the names changed.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: For use in an Aztec calendar. So, if we
can cross-reference our current star field, positioning of the Stars of
Kikin and backtrack positioning based off of the Aztec</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: -along with taking into account the point of
origin of the first occurrence, we should know where another portal
could take place. Max, what are you up to?</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Leonardo, time cannot be moved faster by
wearing a groove in our floor.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Seriously, dude. We’re all stressed.
Try to chill.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: You’re playing video games on the possible
eve of Armageddon, Mikey.</p>
<p>****: But I never said I was having fun.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Where’s Raph?</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Leonardo, a true leader knows the virtue
of patience… and when to stop exercising it.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: We’re almost done, Leo. You might want to
go get him… If you can find him, that is.</p>
<p>****: Monay, monay, monay, MONAYYYY …monay!</p>
<p><strong>treasure hunter</strong>: Pfft. Figgers.</p>
<p><strong>treasure hunter</strong>: Lousy metal detector. “Happy
Anniversary” present, my big fat keister.</p>
<p><strong>inters</strong>: To picking up the pieces.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: Two creatures remain, my lord.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Well, by all means then. Let’s finish
it.</p>
<p><strong>nightwatcher</strong>: Hey there little fella. All that
commotion for just little ole y-</p>
<p><strong>wahh! ooof! aaaggh! ow!! whoaaa!!!</strong>: Plates, glasses
and utensils fly everywhere, smashing all over the diner as the Demon
pummels him. CLOSE ON NIGHT - The Demon is jumping up and down, slamming
his helmeted head repeatedly to the floor! It lunges forward, mouth open
as Night backhands it with a PLATE. The Demon jumps back and up, landing
on a rotating CEILING FAN.</p>
<p><strong>t</strong>: he creature lunges down again, but this time,
Night is ready. He fights back. Like fighting with a Chihuahua hopped up
on cocaine. A break in the fight. The creature has disappeared. Night
knows he’s there. He preps. Grabs his SMOKE PELLETS from his pocket. And
waits… until… …the Demon swoops in for another attack! Mouth open, fangs
bared as Night tosses the smoke pellets inside! WIDE - POOOMPH! POOOMPH!
POOOMPH! The pellets explode in its mouth, sending smoke shooting out of
it’s nostrils, ears and eyes! It shrieks, flying out of the Diner!</p>
<p><strong>nightwatcher</strong>: Yeah! That’s what I thought! Don’t
mess with the Nightwatcher!</p>
<p><strong>diner cook</strong>: Pl-pl-please don’t hurt me!</p>
<p><strong>nightwatcher</strong>: Whattaya talkin’ about? I JUST</p>
<p><strong>diner cook</strong>: Please, sir. I have kids.</p>
<p><strong>nightwatcher</strong>: There ya go, pal. Make sure this is
safe. HEY - YOU HEARIN’ ME?</p>
<p><strong>i just saved your stinkin’ life!</strong>: Sudddenly - SHINK!
- a THROWING STAR is lodged in the cash register till! Night jumps.
Looks out the window. CAM PULLS WAY WAY BACK, REALLY FAST - Out the
Diner and to the rooftop across the street… and over the green shoulders
of LEO. ll he sees is a panicked man and the large shape of Nightwatcher
standing over him, holding the register. CLOSE ON LEO - He’s fuming.
Staring down at Nightwatcher. The frustration of the last few days pent
up inside of him.</p>
<p><strong>b</strong>: ACK IN DINER - Night slowly lays down the
register. Trying to figure out his next move.</p>
<p><strong>nightwatcher</strong>: This night just keeps gettin’ better
n’ better…</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Nice try, amateur.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Oof! You’re a heavy boy, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Okay, someone’s been training pretty
hard.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: I want you to know that I appreciate your
intentions. But you can’t change the world like this.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: Oh god. He’s lecturing.</p>
<p><strong>eonardo</strong>: …so I’m going to give you one chance to
just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>nightwatcher</strong>: Okay, Leo. Wanna play?</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: What? How did you-</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Goodnight, dark prince.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: R-raph?</p>
<p>****: What?</p>
<p><strong>aaaaaaaaghh!!</strong>: He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles
back, still in shock. They yell at each other through the pouring
rain.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: You’re so friggin’ smug! You think the
world revolves around YOU, dontcha? That we couldn’t POSSIBLY survive
without the mighty and powerful Leonardo to guide us through our
problems, HUH?!</p>
<p>****: Well, I gotta newsflash for ya - we got along just fine without
you.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: I was training! Training to be a better
leader! For you! Why do you hate me for that?!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: …and whoever said I wanted to be led? I
shoulda gone on that training!</p>
<p><strong>y</strong>: OU WEREN’T READY! You’re impatient and
hot-tempered! And more importantly… I’m better than you.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Well, big brother, I’d have to disagree
with you on that one.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: The Foot report of strange activity five
blocks north of your location.</p>
<p><strong>general serpiente</strong>: The final creature.</p>
<p><strong>millimeters from his eyeball!</strong>: Tense. Raph shakes.
He looks like he’s going to do it… then stops. He collapses back. Almost
ashamed of what he’s done. Leo just can’t believe that Raph bested him.
They pant heavily. The rain dies down. Raph RUNS AWAY, across a few
rooftops. Away from his brother. He suddenly STOPS and looks back at
Leo, small in the distance. CLOSE ON LEO - A SHADOW suddenly falls over
him. He looks up to see the FOUR GENERALS surrounding him. He tries to
fight back… but is too wiped from Raph. GATO POV - “reading” Leo on the
ground. He frowns.</p>
<p><strong>general gato</strong>: It is neither monster nor human.</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: Then he shall perfectly serve our
purposes… let us inform our commander that the final creature has been
captured.</p>
<p><strong>leo!!!</strong>: Raph runs closer as the Generals lower to
the ground and drive off. Raph jumps from rooftop to rooftop to try and
catch his brother.</p>
<p><strong>l</strong>: eo!!! Hang on!!</p>
<p><strong>noooooooo!!!!</strong>: Raph gets weak and collapses to his
knees on the roof. The sun begins to rise. He has to return to the
sewer.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Raphael? What is the matter?</p>
<p>****: I was out, and did… something… something happened and I-
ARRRGH!!!</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Raphael! Kneel.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I did something… I did something really
stupid, Master Splinter.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Go on…</p>
<p>****: I know why you chose him now. I know that there’s a reason why
he’s the better son and I’m not.</p>
<p>****: And I think I made things worse tonight. A WHOLE lot worse… I
know you must be ashamed of me, father.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Raphael. You always bear the world’s
problems on your shoulders. It is an admirable quality when you are a
protector of others…</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: But you must realize that while, at times,
you may not be my favorite student, it does not mean that you are my
least favorite son.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: You are strong, passionate and loyal to a
fault. These are the merits of a great leader as well… but only when
tempered with compassion and humility.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: But Master Splinter, I messed up big
tonight… I mean BIG.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Leonardo? R</p>
<p><strong>aphael</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Well then, I believe your brothers may be
in need of a leader.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Thank you… father.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Dudes. I think you’re gonna want to
check this out.</p>
<p>****: Where’s Leo?</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: So, the first time that this portal was
opened, the Stars of Kikin aligned…</p>
<p>****: …and that’s why it occurred in that specific South American
region. Now if we take into account the continual rotation of the Earth
since then, as well as the gradual celestial shift that’s happened and
been recorded over… well, over the course of that mountain of books over
there… we now know our new location.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Precisely at 40.748 degrees latitude and
-073.985 Degrees longitude.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: New York City.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Winters Tower.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: And the alignment is due to occur in
precisely- - well… tonight.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: But without Leo… what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: We rescue our brother… and save New York
City.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Together.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Picked it up on my last trip to Japan. You…
like it?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Oh… oh yeah.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Where’s your mask?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Mask? What mask?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: No way…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I was saving it for our anniversary.</p>
<p>****: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: That’s our ride.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: You know I ain’t much on speeches.</p>
<p>****: But we can do this. Leo, or no Leo. Not because of our
individual strengths… but because of how we function as a team.</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: I love you man.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Don’t push it. April, this is going to be
dangerous. You sure you’re in?</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I feel responsible, fellas. I found the
Generals for him.</p>
<p><strong>r</strong>: Van in full view.</p>
<p><strong>aphael</strong>: Nice an’ incognito there, Mikey.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Well, I didn’t see you offering any
suggestions… besides- - a true ninja can hide in plain sight, my
son!</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: I heard that!</p>
<p><strong>bubbly weather reporter</strong>: Scientists are calling it
the fiercest storm of the new millennium, with Dopler Radar readings
coming in off the charts. Authorities are imposing a curfew to avoid
possible civilian harm. Stay tuned for more in minutes.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: As ordered - no one gets in. No one
interferes. No one bears witness.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Yeah, hey, I was supposed to drop this off
for Mr. Winters. If I don’t get this done, I am majorly in the doghouse.
You know what I’m sayin’, right? Right?</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: Please come in, then.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Really!? I mean, “but of course”.</p>
<p><strong>aphael</strong>: Let’s NEVER do this again. And who did
that?!</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: What?! Why does everyone always call
ME out?</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: I apologize my sons.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: I suppose this is where we all take out our
sharp and pointy things?</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: You suppose correctly.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I am SO gonna enjoy this…</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: I had the situation under control.</p>
<p>****: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Guys! Front door is open. Now!</p>
<p><strong>s</strong>: PACE - The final star drifts into position. A
LIGHT BURST EFFECT travels down each star, headed to Earth. BACK IN
LOBBY - The light burst flies into the lobby and hits the circle in the
middle of all the monsters’ cells. ON CIRCLE - The pieces suddenly start
to move around. Almost like a sliding puzzle. Then they start to
randomly SINK further into the ground. Light pours out of them, until
all of them give way to create THE PORTAL. POV OFFICE ABOVE - Each of
the Thirteen Cells LIGHT UP to acknowledge their contents. 1… 2… 3…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Finally… finally!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: What did you do?!</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: What do we do, dudes?!</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: We get ready for round two.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Nice work, Jones.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: I have my moments…</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Look!</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: And that would be the swirling vortex to
another world, I assume.</p>
<p>****: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Leo! Is that you?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: I guess that would be a “no”.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Out of the way, please.</p>
<p><strong>d</strong>: on places a small EXPLOSIVE on a key lock. Raph
pulls Leo out. LIFELESS.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Hey buddy! Come on, man. Leo, please wake
up!</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Wh-wh-what took you s-so long?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Listen, I - I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>smash!!!!</strong>: ANGLE UP - As WINTERS is thrown out the
window of his elevator office! He heads straight for a sword wielding
BRONZE STATUE… particularly the sword part. Closer… closer… and… ..just
misses it. WHUMP! He crashes onto the floor.</p>
<p><strong>motionless.</strong>: ON GROUP - They just stare at him. Back
up to the office, nearly 150 feet above them. ON BALCONY ABOVE - Aguila
looks down. Snarls.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Is he… is he dead?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Yup. He’s WAY dead, dude.</p>
<p>****: Raph can’t take it any more. He draws his sais and thrusts them
at Winters. THAT gets his attention. Winters looks up in awe at seeing
the mutated freaks in front of him.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Fascinating…</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Mister Winters. We mean you no harm.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: No harm?! Whatever! I’m about to give you
piercin’s in places you never imagined if you don’t tell us what’s going
on.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: We were so close… so close.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: This was our chance. We could have changed
it all.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: We know everything Max. We know you’re trying
to recreate what Yaotl started 3000 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>inters</strong>: There are things, Miss O’Neil, no one could
possibly know…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: It was I who stood on that battlefield all
those years ago.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: And we had to pay a price.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: We were cursed that day. My four
comrades-in-arms were turned into stone.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: My curse was to live… forever. To feel the
pain of losing love time and time again. Of boredom. The pain… of
time.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: We were doomed to live this way until, as
the Shaman put it, “you corrected the mistakes of your past”. That’s
what this is about. Penance, Miss O’Neil. Finally getting a chance to
right our wrongs.</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: Our master fails to include crucial
points in his tale.</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: He fails to discuss the petrified
agony of three thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>general serpiente</strong>: Of the torture of taking
CENTURIES to merely blink an eye!</p>
<p><strong>general gato</strong>: Of watching the erosion of your own
body throughout centuries.</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: So, while our great leader basked in
the warmth of the sun and the glory of fresh air… we rotted in the stone
hell that lasted throughout Wmillennia.</p>
<p><strong>inters</strong>: My brothers, I-</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: WE ARE NO BROTHERS TO YOU! Our
brotherhood was broken the day that you condemned us to this
eternity.</p>
<p><strong>general gato</strong>: And now, our Master has tired of
feeding on the nectar of life. Of loving his entire life. Of FEELING. So
he prefers to end it all. End HIS “misery” at the expense of ours.</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: But thanks to his cunning, his
technology, we are now capable of LIVING… we have now become- -
gods.</p>
<p><strong>general serpiente</strong>: And we shall finish what we began
all those years ago. We will finally have our victory.</p>
<p><strong>general gato</strong>: Even with one monster still free, the
curse can never be broken!</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: Join us. Join us Yaotl, and live a
life eternal with us at your side!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Never. This was our opportunity! We were
wrong! Don’t you understand?!</p>
<p>****: And you are weak.</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: Destroy them.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: What does THAT mean?</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: It means we’re going to help you.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: My soldiers will find the thirteenth monster.
And you will bring it back here. Hurry - we don’t have much time.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: I got shotgun!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: If you mess with one of us- -you mess with
all of us.</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: Challenge accepted.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: They must face them alone. As
brothers.</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Alright. We have more important things to
do!</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Help me push the cells into the portal!</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: This has got to be the suckiest vehicle to
save the world with.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: So… anybody from out of town?</p>
<p><strong>and casey/april monster chase…</strong>: LOBBY - The
combatants all pair off for their final battle. Utter commotion. Mikey
is paired with Serpiente. Donnie is paired with the General Mono. He
uses his quick speed and expert staff against the hammer-weilding
Statue. Leo fights with Gato. He can’t dodge him. He’s too fast. Leo
lands a lucky blow, but Gato recoils - BOOM! Leo’s knocked shell-first
into a large GLASS DISPLAY CASE filled with swords and bladed weapons of
all kinds.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Come to daddy.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Sensei! How you guys doing?!</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Wonderful, my son. WONDERFUL!</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: My troops have located the final monster. At
the harbor docks.</p>
<p><strong>asey</strong>: Oh, I got this one covered.</p>
<p><strong>i</strong>: NSIDE THE VAN - Everyone is in shock. The ninjas
look at each other.</p>
<p><strong>asey</strong>: Huh. Now there’s somethin’ you don’t see every
day…</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Well, I guess we have to figure out how to
get handsome here back to Winters’ Tower.</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: We should tie it to the van and drag it
back.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Wow. You’re… hard core.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Incoming!</p>
<p><strong>fast! go fast now!!!</strong>: Casey guns it, the 12-foot
creature mere inches away! STARS IN SKY - Karai sees the stars are
slowly moving out of alignment. Losing time fast. BACK IN LOBBY - CRANE
DOWN on Winters and Splinter. On the last full cell. ON PORTAL - A pair
of LARGE EYES are threatening to come out. In the BG, dozens of winged
DEMONS fly around inside.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: They better hurry with that last
monster!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I’m sure my man Casey’s got it all under
control…</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: That’s what I’m afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>best idea!!!!</strong>: WIDER - We see that he’s on top of
the Van, acting as LIVE BAIT to attract the creature! It’s working too!
The creature pounces along like an awkward greyhound run. April
drives.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: What are you doing in here?!</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Ran outta food.</p>
<p><strong>aphael</strong>: Listen. I’m the last guy to sound like a TV
cartoon, but I think we need to work together.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Teamwork. The more you know…</p>
<p>****: Why Raph, no solo act tonight?</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Yes. Yes, my sons.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: So who wants ta call it a day?</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: I’m in.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: Affirmative.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Roger dodger, dude.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: My sons, I am so proud of you all.</p>
<p><strong>general aguila</strong>: Silly children. We are immortals
made of stone! The Earth has only BEGUN to feel our wrath!</p>
<p><strong>look out!</strong>: Winters dives in and pushes the Turtles
out of way as the Creature flies in and knocks the Generals back into
the Portal! The Cloud Tendrils grab a hold of it and pull it back into
the Portal! ON STARS - The Stars move out of alignment, ending the
cycle. ON PORTAL - It begins to close. The Generals struggle to get out,
only now, we see they are HUMAN… their curse broken… and an eternity of
pain and suffering ahead of them.</p>
<p><strong>you cannot defeat us! we-</strong>: WHAM! - Raph and Leo
team-roundhouse him back into oblivion!</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I thought he’d never shut up.</p>
<p><strong>yeah! whoohoo! we did it!</strong>: The brothers high five
one another. Splinter smiles proud. ON VAN - Dusty and smoking. The door
clangs open. Casey piles out. Karai comes next and accidentally FALLS on
Casey in a very compromising position! She slyly smiles. April falls out
last beside them.</p>
<p><strong>casey</strong>: Oh. I, uh -</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: Don’t try to tell me for one second that you
didn’t enjoy tha-</p>
<p><strong>awwwwww….</strong>: Raph and Leo look at each other. A beat.
Then hug. Brothers again. Dialogue would just ruin this moment. Splinter
walks over to them. CAM ADJUSTS to show Karai and the Foot Ninja
standing there. Silence. Finally, Karai steps forward -</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: You are every bit the warriors I was informed
you were. You have passed.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Passed what?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: You know us?</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: I’ve known OF you for some time. Savor your
victory tonight. For soon we will have further business together.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: What kind of business?</p>
<p><strong>karai</strong>: The kind that involves familiar faces from
your past…</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: She doesn’t mean…</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Winters?</p>
<p><strong>ichaelangelo</strong>: I’m never usually that happy to be
bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>donatello</strong>: You would be if you were an immortal who
couldn’t bleed for three thousand years…</p>
<p><strong>winters</strong>: Thank you. Thank you from the bottom of my
heart. You’ve made a very old man, very very happy.</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: So, um, what happens now?</p>
<p><strong>michaelangelo</strong>: Okay… just a little bit creepy.</p>
<p>****: Oh gawd. I think he’s in my n-n-</p>
<p><strong>attchooooo!! oh gross!!!</strong>: CAM PULLS BACK, out of the
building, onto the street. See the destruction. The clearing skies. THE
SUNRISE.</p>
<p><strong>aphael</strong>: You wanted to see me Sensei?</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: Sit down, Raphael.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Thank you, Master Splinter, for your
guidance. I can only hope that one day, I will be able to begin the next
stage of my training like Leo.</p>
<p><strong>splinter</strong>: That, my son, you already have.</p>
<p>****: Our training works in mysterious ways. But the answer that lies
in all our questions… is family.</p>
<p><strong>plinter</strong>: Ahh. Double chocolate fudge.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: So we’re cool with the whole Nightwatcher
thing?</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Yeah, we’re cool. Our secret, bro. You got
rid of the stuff, right?</p>
<p><strong>eonardo</strong>: What about the bike, tho?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Okay, so I couldn’t exactly destroy the
bike.</p>
<p>****: Let’s just say it’s in good hands.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: I mean, it’s in good hands.</p>
<p><strong>leonardo</strong>: Oh, you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>whaaaaaaaaahoooooooooooooooooo!!!</strong>: As Casey roars
down the street on the black motorcycle of Nightwatcher, barely able to
hang on.</p>
<p><strong>april</strong>: …yes.</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: So what makes a family? Personally, it’s
more than sharing a roof or a bathroom. It’s sharing life… My father
taught me that, and I think it’s pretty much true… y’know, provided that
you don’t kill each other in the process. Or that no one touches your
stuff. Or makes loud noises when you’re trying to sleep. Or…</p>
<p><strong>raphael</strong>: Hey, nobody said it was easy.</p>
