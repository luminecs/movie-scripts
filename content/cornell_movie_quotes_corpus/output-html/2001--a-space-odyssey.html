You’re looking wonderful.</p>

friend, Dr. Heywood Floyd. I’d like you to meet Andre Smyslov…</p>
<p><strong>smyslov and the two</strong>: OTHER RUSSIAN WOMEN STAND UP
AND SMILE</p>
<p><strong>they shake hands</strong>: AFTER INTRODUCTION AND AD-LIB
‘HELLOS’</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: And this is Dr. Kalinan… Stretyneva…</p>
<p><strong>the russians are</strong>: VERY WARM AND FRIENDLY.</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Dr. Floyd, won’t you join us for a
drink?</p>
<p><strong>b20</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: I’m afraid I’ve only got a few minutes, but
I’d love to.</p>
<p><strong>there is a bit of</strong>: CONFUSION AS ALL REALISE THERE IS
NOT ENOUGH ROOM FOR ANOTHER PERSON AT THE TABLE. SMYSLOV OFFERS FLOYD
HIS CHAIR AND BORROWS ANOTHER FROM A NEARBY TABLE</p>
<p><strong>symyslov</strong>: What would you like to drink?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Oh, I really don’t have time for a drink. If
it’s all right I’ll just sit for a minute and then I’ve got to be
off.</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Are you quite sure?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Yes, really, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Well… How’s your lovely wife?</p>
<p><strong>b20</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: She’s wonderful.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: And your charming little daughter?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Oh, she’s growing up very fast. As a matter
of fact, she’s six tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Oh, that’s such a delightful age.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: How is gregor?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: He’s fine. But I’m afraid we don’t get a
chance to see each other very much these days.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Well, where are all of you off to?</p>
<p><strong>b20</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Actually, we’re on our way back from the
moon. We’ve just spent three months calibrating the new antenna at
Tchalinko. And what about you?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Well, as it happens, I’m on my way up to the
moon</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Are you, by any chance, going up to your
base at Clavius?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Yes,as a matter of fact, I am.</p>
<p><strong>the russians</strong>: EXCHANGE SIGNIFICANT GLANCES</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Is there any particular reason why you
ask?</p>
<p><strong>b20</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Well, Dr. Floyd, I hope that you don’t
think I’m too inquisitive, but perhaps you can clear up the mystery
about what’s been going on up there.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: I’m sorry, but I’m not sure I know what you
mean.</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Well, it’s just for the past two weeks
there have been some extremely odd things happening at Clavius.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Yes. Well, for one thing, whenever you
phone the base, all you can get is a recording which repeats that the
phone lines are temporarily out of order.</p>
<p><strong>b20</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Well, I suppose they’ve been having a bit of
trouble with some of the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Yes, well at first we thought that was the
explanation, but it’s been going on for the past ten days.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: You mean you haven’t been able to get anyone
at the base for ten days?</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Another thing, Heywood, two days ago, one of
our rocket buses was denied permission for an emergency landing at
Clavius.</p>
<p><strong>b20</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: How did they manage to do that without any
communication?</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Clavius Control came on the air just long
enough to transmit their refusal.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Well, that does sound very odd.</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Yes, and I’m afaid there’s going to be a
bit of a row about it. Denying the men permission to land was a direct
violation of the I.A.S. convention.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Yes… Well, I hope the crew got back
safely.</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Fortunately, they did.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Well, I’m glad about that.</p>
<p><strong>b20</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>the russians exchange</strong>: MORE GLANCES. ONE OF THE
WOMEN OFFERS AROUND A PILL BOX. ELENA AND ANOTHER RUSSIAN TAKE ONE AND
THE THIRD RUSSIAN DELCINES.</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Dr. Floyd, at the risk of pressing you on a
point you seem reticent to discuss, may I ask you a straightforward
question?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: Quite frankly, we have had some very
reliable intelligence reports that a quite serious epidemic has broken
out at Clavius. Something, apperently, of an unknown origin. Is this, in
fact, what has happened?</p>
<p><strong>a long, awkward</strong>: PAUSE</p>
<p><strong>b20</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: I’m sorry, Dr. Smyslov, but I’m really not at
liberty to discuss this.</p>
<p><strong>smyslov</strong>: This epidemic could easily spread to our
base, Dr. Floyd. We should be given all the facts.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Dr. Smyslov… I’m not permitted to discuss
this.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Are you sure you won’t change your mind about
a drink?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: No, thank you… and I’m afraid now I really
must be going.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Well, I hope that you and your wife can come
to the I.A.C. conference in June.</p>
<p><strong>b20</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: We’re trying to get there. I hope we can.</p>
<p><strong>elena</strong>: Well, Gregor and I will look forward to
seeing you.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Thank you. It’s been a great pleasure to meet
all of you… Dr. Smyslov.</p>
<p><strong>the russians all</strong>: RISE AND THERE ARE AD-LIBS OF
COURTESY</p>
<p><strong>floyd shakes hands</strong>: AND EXITS</p>
<p><strong>the russians exchange</strong>: A FEW SERIOUS PARA- GRAPHES
IN RUSSIAN</p>

FROM SPACE STATION</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The Aries-IB has become the standard
Space-Station-to-Lunar surface vehicle. It was powered by low-thrust
plasma jets which would continue the mild acceler- ation for fifteen
minutes. Then the ship would break the bonds of gravity and be a free
and indepen- dent planet, circling the Sun in an orbit of its own.</p>

<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Oh, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well, how’s it going back there?</p>
<p><strong>stewardess</strong>: Fine. Very quiet. He’s been asleep since
we left.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well, no one can say that he’s not enjoying
the wonders of Space.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Well, whatever’s going on up there, he’s
going to arrive fresh and ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>b22</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I wonder what really IS going on up
there?</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Well, I’ve heard more and more people talk
of an epidemic.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I suppose it was bound to happen sooner or
later.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Berkeley told me that they think it came
from contamination on a returning Mars flight.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Yes, well, whatever it is, they’re certainly
not fooling around. This is the first flight they allowed in for more
than a week.</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: I was working out what this trip must
cost, taking him up there by himself and coming back empty.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I’ll bet it’s a fortune.</p>
<p><strong>b22</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>co-pilot</strong>: Well, at ten thousand dollars a ticket, it
comes to the better part of six hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well, as soon as he wakes up, I’m going to go
back and talk to him. I must say, I’d like to find out what’s going
on.</p>
<p><strong>b23</strong>: ARIES-IB IN SPACE. MOON VERY LARGE.</p>
<p><strong>b24</strong>: ARIES-IB PASSENGER AREA. FLOYD FINISHING
BREAKFAST.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well, good afternoon, Dr. Floyd. Did you have
a good rest?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Oh, marvellous. It’s the first real sleep
I’ve had for the past two days.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: There’s nothing like weightless sleep for a
complete rest.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: When do we arrive at Clavius?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: We’re scheduled to dock in about seven hours.
Is there anything we can do for you?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Oh, no, thank you. The two girls have taken
wonderful care of me. I’m just fine.</p>
<p><strong>b24</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well, if there is anything that you wnat,
just give a holler.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can
have a word with you about the security arrangements?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well… the crew is confined to the ship when
we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit
- about twenty-four hours. And then we’re going to back empty.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: I take it this is something to do with the
trouble they’re having up at Clavius?</p>
<p><strong>b24</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: I’m afraid that’s out of my depart- ment,
Captain.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well, I’ll tell you why I ask. You see, I’ve
got a girl who works in the Auditing Department of the Territorial
Administrator and I haven’t been able to get her on the phone for the
past week or so, and with all these stories one hears, I’m a little
concerned about her.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: I see. Well, I’m sorry about that. I wouldn’t
think there’s any cause for alarm.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Yes, well, I wouldn’t have been too concerned
about it, except I’ve heard these stories about the epidemic and, as a
matter of fact, I’ve heard that ten people have died already.</p>
<p><strong>b24</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: I wish I could be more helpful, Captain, but
as I’ve said, I don’t think there’s any cause for alarm.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well, fine. Thanks very much, anyway, and I
hope you don’t mind me asking?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: No, of course, Captain, I can understand your
concern.</p>
<p><strong>pilot</strong>: Well, thank you very much, and please let us
know if there is anything we can do to make your trip more
comfortable.</p>

<p><strong>b29</strong>: ARIES-IB ORBITING MOON.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The laws of Earthly aesthetics did not
apply here, this world had been shaped and molded by other than
terrestrial forces, operating over aeons of time unknown to the young,
verdant Earth, with its fleeting Ice-Ages, its swiftly rising and
falling seas, its mountain ranges dissolving like mists before the dawn.
Here was age inconceivable - but not death, for the Moon had never lived
until now.</p>

<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The Base at Clavius was the first American
Lunar Settlement that could, in an emergency, be entirely
self-supporting.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Water and all the necessities of life for
its eleven hundred men, women and children were produced from the Lunar
rocks, after they had been crushed, heated and chemically processed.</p>

<p><strong>b35</strong>: LOW GRAVITY GYMNASIUM TRICK WITH CHILDREN.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: One of the attractions of life on the Moon
was undoubtedly the low gravity which produced a sense of general
well-being.</p>
<p><strong>b36</strong>: CHILDREN IN SCHOOL. TEACHER SHOWING THEM VIEWS
OF EARTH AND MAP OF EARTH.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The personnel of the Base and their
children were the forerunners of new nations, new cultures that would
ultimately spread out across the solar system. They no longer thought of
Earth as home. The time was fast approaching when Earth, like all
mothers, must say farewell to her children.</p>

<p><strong>floyd and welcoming</strong>: PARTY WALK THROUGH AFTER
EXITING ELEVATOR. HALVERSON, MICHAELS AND FIVE OTHERS.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: I must congratulate you Halvorsen. you’ve
done wonder- ful things with the decor since the last time I was
here.</p>
<p><strong>halvorsen</strong>: Well… thank you, Dr. Floyd. We try to
make the environment as earthlike as possible.</p>
<p><strong>b38</strong>: LOW CEILING CONFERENCE ROOM, “U” SHAPED TABLE
FACING THREE PROJECTION SCREENS. SEATED AROUND THE TABLE ARE TWENTY
SENIOR BASE PERSONNEL.</p>
<p><strong>halvorsen</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to
introduce Dr. Heywood Floyd, a distinguished member of the National
Council of Astronautics. He has just completed a special flight here
from Earth to be with us, and before the briefing he would like to say a
few words. Dr. Floyd.</p>
<p><strong>polite applause. floyd</strong>: WALKS TO FRONT OF ROOM.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: First of all, I bring a personal message from
Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all
of you for the personal sacrifices you have made, and of course his
congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the
most significant in the history of science.</p>
<p><strong>b38</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>b38</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: This is the view of the Council and the
purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the
situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and
how the news should eventually be announced. Are there any
questions?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can
be kept under wraps?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: I’m afraid it can and it will be kept under
wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of
course you know that the Council has requested that formal security
oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any
knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to
be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to
making a public announcement.</p>
<p><strong>b38</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>halvorsen</strong>: We will, of course, cooperate in any way
possible, Dr. Floyd.</p>

<p><strong>b41</strong>: TMA-1 EXCAVATION. AIR VIEW. ROCKET BUS

<p><strong>a small control</strong>: PANEL MOUNTED AT THE HEAD OF THE

ILLUMINATED.</p>
<p><strong>halvorsen</strong>: Well, there it is.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Can we go down there closer to it?</p>
<p><strong>halvorsen</strong>: Certainly.</p>
<p><strong>b44</strong>: THEY START DOWN WORKING RAMP</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Does your geology on it still check out?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Yes, it does. The sub-surface structure
shows that it was deliberately buried about four million years ago.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: How can you tell it was deliberately
buried?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: By the deformation between the mother rock
and the fill.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Any clue as to what it is?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Not really. It’s completely inert. No
sound or energy sources have been detected. The surface is made of
something incredibly hard and we’ve been barely able to scratch it. A
laser drill</p>
<p><strong>b44</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: might do something, but we don’t want to
be too rough until we know a little more.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: But you don’t have any idea as to what it
is?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part,
take your choice.</p>
<p><strong>halvorsen</strong>: The only thing about it that we are sure
of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond
the Earth.</p>
<p><strong>halvorsen</strong>: Four million years ago, something,
presumably from the stars, must have swept through the solar system and
left this behind.</p>
<p><strong>b44</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a
purpose?</p>
<p><strong>halvorsen</strong>: I suppose we’ll never know.</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: The moon would have made an excellent base
camp for preliminary Earth surveys.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Any ideas about the colour?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Well, not really. At first glance, black
would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone
deliberately bury a sun- powered device?</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: Has it been exposed to any sun before
now?</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: I don’t think it has, but I’d like to
check that. Simpson, what’s the log on that?</p>
<p><strong>b45</strong>: INSIDE MONITOR DOME WE SEE A NUMBER OF
TELEVISION DISPLAYS INCLUDING SEVERAL TV VIEWS OF FLOYD AND COMPANY IN
THE EXCAVATION.</p>
<p><strong>simpson</strong>: The first surface was exposed at 0843 on
the 12th April… Let me see… that would have been forty-five minutes
after Lunar sun-set. I see here that special lighting equipment had to
be brought up before any futher work could be done.</p>
<p><strong>b46</strong>: TMA-1 EXCAVATION</p>
<p><strong>michaels</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>floyd</strong>: And so this is the first sun that it’s had in
four million years.</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Excuse me, gentlemen, if you’d all
line up on this side of the walkway we’d like to take a few
photographes. Dr. Floyd, would you thand in the middle… Dr. Michaels on
that side, Mr. Halvorsen on the other…. thank you.</p>
<p><strong>the photographer</strong>: QUICKLY MAKES SOME EXPOSURES</p>
<p><strong>photographer</strong>: Thank you very much gentlemen, I’ll
have the base photo section send you copies.</p>
<p><strong>as the men slowly</strong>: SEPERATE FROM THEIR PICTURE POSE,
THERE IS A PIERCINGLY POWERFUL SERIES OF FIVE ELECTRONIC SHRIEKS, EACH
LIKE A HIDEOUSLY OVER-LOADED AND DISTORTED TIME SIGNAL. FLOYD
INVOLUNTARILY TRIES TO BLOCK HIS EARS WITH HIS SPACESUITED HANDS. THEN
COMES MERCIFUL SILENCE.</p>
<p><strong>b47</strong>: VARIOUS SHOTS OF SPACE MONITORS, ASTEROIDS, THE
SUN, PLUTO, MARS.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: A hundred million miles beyond Mars, in
the cold lonliness where no man had yet travelled, Deep-Space-Monitor-79
drifts slowly among the tangled orbits of the asteroids.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Radiation detectors noted and analyzed
incoming cosmic rays from the galaxy and points beyond; neutron and
x-ray telescopes kept watch on strange stars that no human eye would
eever see; magnetometers observed the gusts and hurricanes of the solar
winds, as the sun breathed million mile-an-hour blasts of plasma into
the faces of its circling children.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: All these things and many others were
patiently noted by Deep- Space-Monitor-79, and recorded in its
crystalline memory.</p>
<p><strong>b47</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But now it had noted something strange -
the faint yet unmistakable distrubance rippling across the solar system,
and quite unlike any natural phenomena it had ever observed in the
past.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It was also observed by Orbiter M-15,
circling Mars twice a day; and High Inclination Probe- 21, climbing
slowly above the planet of the ecliptic; and even artificial Comet-5,
heading out into the cold wastes beyond Pluto, along an orbit whose far
point it would not reach for a thousand years.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: All noticed the peculiar burst of energy
that leaped from the face of the Moon and moved across the solar system,
throwing off a spray of radiation like the wake of a racing
speedboat.</p>

<p><strong>poole</strong>: Dave, if you’ve a minute, I’d like your
advice on something.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Sure, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Well, it’s nothing really important, but it’s
annoying.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: It’s about my salary cheques.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Well I got the papers on my official
up-grading to AGS-19 two weeks before we left.</p>
<p><strong>c12</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Yes, I remember you mentioning it. I got
mine about the same time.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: That’s right. Well, naturally, I didn’t say
anything to Payroll. I assumed they’d start paying me at the higher
grade on the next pay cheque. But it’s been almost three weeks now and
I’m still being paid as an AGS-18.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Interesting that you mention it, because
I’ve got the same problem.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Yesterday, I finally called the Accounting
Office at Mission Control, and all they could tell me was that they’d
received the AGS-19 notification for the other three but not mine, and
apparently not yours either.</p>
<p><strong>c12</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Did they have any explanation for this?</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Not really. They just said it might be
because we trained at Houston and they trained in Marshall, and that
we’re being charged against differ- ent accounting offices.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: It’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Well, what do you think we ought to do about
it?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: I don’t think we should make any fuss about
it yet. I’m sure they’ll straighten it out.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: I must say, I never did understand why they
split us into two groups for training.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: No. I never did, either.</p>
<p><strong>c12</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: We spent so little time with them, I have
trouble keeping their names straight.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: I suppose the idea was specialized
training.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: I suppose so. Though, of course, there’s a
more sinister explanation.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Oh?</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Yes. You must have heard the rumour that went
around during orbital check-out.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: No, as a matter of fact, I didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Oh, well, apparently there’s something about
the mission that the sleeping beauties know that we don’t know, and
that’s why we were trained separately and that’s why they were put to
sleep before they were even taken aboard.</p>
<p><strong>c12</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Well, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: I don’t know. All I heard is that there’s
something about the mission we weren’t told.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: That seems very unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Yes, I thought so.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Of course, it would be very easy for us to
find out now.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Just ask Hal. It’s conceivable they might
keep something from us, but they’d never keep anything from Hal.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: That’s true.</p>
<p><strong>c12</strong>: CONINUED</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Well… it’s silly, but… if you want to, why
don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>poole walks to the</strong>: HAL 9000 COMPUTER</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Hal… Dave and I believe that there’s
something about the mission that we weren’t told. Something that the
rest of the crew know and that you know. We’d like to know whether this
is true.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’m sorry, Frank, but I don’t think I can
answer that question without knowing everything that all of you
know.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: He’s got a point.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Okay, then how do we re-phrase the
question?</p>
<p><strong>c12</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Still, you really don’t believe it, do
you?</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Not really. Though, it is strange when you
think about it. It didn’t really make any sense to keep us apart during
training.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Yes, but it’s to fantastic to think that
they’d keep something from us.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: I know. It would be almost inconceivable.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: But not completely inconceivable?</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: I suppose it isn’t logically impossible.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: I guess it isn’t.</p>

are we coming back, and… why are we going?</p>

statements are true or false.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I will if I can, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: Our Mission Profile calls for Discovery going
to Saturn. True or false?</p>

hibernation, the recovery vehicle will make rendezous with us and bring
us back. Is this true?</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: That’s true</p>
<p><strong>poole</strong>: There is no other purpose for this mission
than to carry out a continuation of the space program, and to further
our general knowledge of the planets. Is that true?</p>

COMPUTER.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Too bad about Frank, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I suppose you’re pretty broken up about it?</p>
<p><strong>c118</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Yes. I am.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: He was an excellent crew member.</p>
<p><strong>bowman looks</strong>: UNCERTAINLY AT THE COMPUTER.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: It’s a bad break, but it won’t substantially
affect the mission.</p>
<p><strong>bowman thinks</strong>: A LONG TIME.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Hal, give me manual hibernation control.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Have you decided to revive the rest of the
crew, Dave?</p>
<p><strong>c118</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Yes, I have.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I suppose it’s because you’ve been under a lot
of stress, but have you forgotten that they’re not supposed to be
revived for another three months.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: The antenna has to be replaced.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Repairing the antenna is a pretty dangerous
operation.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: It doesn’t have to be, Hal. It’s more
dangerous to be out of touch with Earth. Let me have manual control,
please.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I don’t really agree with you, Dave. My
on-board memory store is more than capable of handling all the mission
requirements.</p>
<p><strong>c118</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Well, in any event, give me the manual
hibernation control.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: If you’re determined to revive the crew now, I
can handle the whole thing myself. There’s no need for you to
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: I’m goin to do this myself, Hal. Let me have
the control, please.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Look, Dave your’ve probably got a lot to do. I
suggest you leave it to me.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Hal, switch to manual hibernation
control.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I don’t like to assert myself, Dave, but it
would be much better now for you to rest. You’ve been involved in a very
stressful situation.</p>
<p><strong>c118</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: I don’t feel like resting. Give me the
control, Hal.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I can tell from the tone of your voice, Dave,
that you’re upset. Why don’t you take a stress pill and get some
rest.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Hal, I’m in command of this ship. I order
you to release the manual hibernation control.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I’m sorry, Dave, but in accordance with
sub-routine C1532/4, quote, When the crew are dead or incapacitated, the
computer must assume control, unquote. I must, therefore, override your
authority now since you are not in any condition to intel- ligently
exercise it.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Hal, unless you follow my instructions, I
shall be forced to disconnect you.</p>
<p><strong>c118</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: If you do that now without Earth contact the
ship will become a helpless derelict.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: I am prepared to do that anyway.</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: I know that you’ve had that on your mind for
some time now, Dave, but it would be a crying shame, since I am so much
more capable of carrying out this mission than you are, and I have such
enthusiasm and confi- dence in the mission.</p>
<p><strong>bowman</strong>: Listen to me very carefully, Hal. Unless you
immediately release the hibernation control and follow every order I
give from this point on, I will immediately got to control central and
carry out a complete disconnection.</p>
<p><strong>c118</strong>: CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>hal</strong>: Look, Dave, you’re certainly the boss. I was
only trying to do what I thought best. I will follow all your orders:
now you have manual hibernation control.</p>
