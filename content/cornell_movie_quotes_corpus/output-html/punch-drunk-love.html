<p><strong>barry</strong>: …yes I’m still on hold…</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: And what was this?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m looking at your advertisement for the
airline promotion and giveaway?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: This is “Fly With Us?”</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: It’s hard to understand because it says in
addition to but I can’t exactly understand in addition to what because
there’s actually nothing to add it too…</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I think that’s a type-o then, that would
be a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: So, just to clarify, I’m sorry: Ten purchases
of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and
then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles
–</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Do you realize that the monetary value of
this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the
purchases?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I don’t know…I mean: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>oc distant sound of a car skidding to a stop, some
vague,</strong>: DISTANT SCREAMING IS HEARD…THEN SILENCE. Barry hears
this, gets distracted, then back to the phone call;</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Can I call you back if I have any further
questions…? Can I get your extension?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: It’s extension 215 if you want to try me
back.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….I’m not exactly sure what that means…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If they break or something. What is it,
plastic?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: It’s a plastic, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing
tomorrow, I’m gonna run the numbers, see what’s what and I’ll give you a
call back –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Did you have my home phone number?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: If you wanted to call me back I could…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m fine, I have your work number.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok…because of the time difference if you
needed to call me early?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s fine. I can just get you at your
office.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ok, bye, bye.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: They’re not open yet?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: They don’t get opened until eight.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Is it ok if I leave my car you think?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I thought they opened at seven. If I left my
car would it be ok?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Do you know them.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Not very well.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys
with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give
them to them?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You think it’s ok where I left it, right
there?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I think that’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: There’s a piano in the street.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ok. Maybe I’ll see you later. Thank you for
your help.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Maybe I’ll see you later, when I pick up my
car?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok.</p>

little bit, looks around, both ways, then casually picks it up and walks

nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah…..you got here early huh?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….yes…..</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t know. I think it’s a piano….a small
piano.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: That’s not a piano…..I have a piano at
home…..where’d you get it?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Well…..it was dropped on the street…..</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Why is it here? Barry….Barry?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: …it just….I don’t know….I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: You do guaranteed sale? etc.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: We back our plungers 100% and we do ask for a
30 to 60 day display on the floor…..</p>
<p><strong>rico</strong>: Barry, your sister’s on line one.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes…..we do ask for….30 to 60 days….</p>
<p><strong>customer</strong>: I think you have a call?</p>

<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok. Yes I’ll see you tonight.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Sorry about that: One thing I wanted to point
out, Dave, is that we’ve just received a large order from the Rio Hotel
and Casino in Las Vegas where we’re going to be supplying their hotel
rooms with the dice and money plunger, so these babies are really moving
well right now…</p>
<p><strong>rico</strong>: Barry, your sister’s on line two. Barry, your

<p><strong>karen</strong>: “chat?” Did you just say “chat?”</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Well, I can’t talk though –</p>
<p><strong>karen</strong>: You just fucking said “chat,” that is so –

You’d like her.</p>

you.</p>

be looking at me.</p>

if we want to.</p>

be myself if that happens.</p>

<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: So it’s ok if I bring her.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Please don’t.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: She’s really cute and she’s really
nice.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: …please, I just don’t want it….</p>

now? Why is it always about you?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah, no, it’s not, it’s just –</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’m trying to be your friend.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’m trying to get you a girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Well, yeah, thank you, but –</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: – but since you’re not going I guess none
of this matters and I’ll bring her anyway.</p>

friend.</p>

moment, looks around….he sees something outside, hesitates, then dodges
back inside the warehouse –</p>

Carlos, Carlos, this is really not supposed to be here. I don’t mean to

from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car
and we’re getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go?
We’re gonna go and eat, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah I can’t.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I have work, I can’t leave.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Seriously, though: We’re going to eat, I

easy on you – I already have your credit card number, your information,
address and stuff. This is so awkward asking like this, I’m sorry –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: This makes me very uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: I need help.</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: Should I just ask your girlfriend? Maybe
I should call back and talk to your girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t have a girlfriend –</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: – you said you did.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I know I did. But I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: You lied to me?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I didn’t lie.</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: Why did you tell me you did, then?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: This is….illegal….I’ll call the police.</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: No you won’t.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I’ll go pay for my car.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: He’s being weird, I’m sorry. I have no
idea why he’s being weird and dressed in a suit –</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: It’s not bad, it’s ok.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: – he’s so strange I don’t know if you
really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I’d
try, but it’s just –</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: It’s ok, it’s alright. I’ll come right back,
I’ll just go pay for my car.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: Come on, I thought we had fun, rich boy
–</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: This is not cool.</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: It was cool last night.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I have to go.</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: Are you telling me no?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No I’m sorry, now I have to get off the

<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: ….this is your mistake….</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Hey, hey, you should ask her out – what
do you think, she’s cute, right?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m gonna call you back.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: She is. I think, why did you come here like
this?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: It’s not cool?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: It’s fine, but –</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: – do you think you’ll ask her out?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I feel really on the spot now.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Are you gonna do it?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t do that. I don’t - things like
that.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You don’t do anything, why are you being
scared?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m not being scared, you’re just going to
rag me if I do this –</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’m not gonna rag you. Why would I do
this just to rag you?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’ll leave then, I’ll go to get something
from my car, go away so you don’t feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious
question:</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?
Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What’s wrong with you?
Are you ok?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I didn’t ask him that. He’s lying.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’re being weird again, see. Come on.
Please don’t be weird.</p>
<p><strong>angle, barry and elizabeth, moments later</strong>: They walk
out and as they do, Lena comes back in with her keys in her hand,
Elizabeth keeps walking past;</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I gotta grab something from my car….</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: We should be going –</p>

<p><strong>barry</strong>: – yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go
but I’m not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here – A lot depends on
this thing I might do here and if that happens I can’t go and if it

<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….Hi…..</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Barry, Line One, Telephone!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>sexy voice</strong>: You’ve just made a war that you cannot
afford.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I’ll do it.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: I’ll do it too.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: But it’s gotta wait until my knee is better.
I can’t risk it.</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: You have to do it now.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: If we drive there it’s a problem.</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: Dean will loan you one of his cars.</p>
<p><strong>jim</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: You have to talk to him –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: How do you know he’s rich?</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: Because I know, I just know. I mean, I
talked to him, I know.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: Where are you guys going?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: California. Los Angeles.</p>
<p><strong>nate</strong>: When are you leaving?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Right now.</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: Let’s go talk to Dean.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Hey guys.</p>
<p><strong>david/jim/nate</strong>: Hey, Dean.</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: So they’ll go.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’m only paying two of you guys.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: That’s cool.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: When can you leave?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: As soon as you want.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I want you to go right away, I think that’s
best. I also need you to check out a car for me down there that this guy
is selling.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You wanna fuck around, asshole? You wanna get
tough, wanna see me kick some motherfuck around here?</p>
<p><strong>regular joe</strong>: Take it easy, man, relax. Don’t –</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ll relax your fucking head – this is my
personal space, man, this is my personal fucking space, you don’t
violate that, you don’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>regular joe</strong>: I’ve got a glass in my hand why don’t
you chill out?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You’ve got a glass?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Take it easy, take it easy you guys in here, I
need to talk to you later, Tommy – I wanna know if you wanna book the
boys –</p>
<p><strong>man</strong>: I’ll talk to you later.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Your expenses are your own.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: I thought Latisha said you would –</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: – she didn’t know what she was talking about
–</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: It’s….whatever….that’s not cool.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: David, Don’t. Just. Seriously. It doesn’t make
sense if you think about it in a fair deal like sense. Ok? It’s
business. Seriously. One hundred dollars for two days work is a lot more
than your family is making sitting around your house. I’m serious now.
Ok. Please. Now. Just stop.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: …keys for the track. You have to gas it up and
save the receipts on that. His address. We have a business address too
if you need that – but hit him at his house first, see what this little
bad boy is all about and shake him up – give him a little doe-see-doe
–</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: Uch. Shut up, Dean.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: You don’t need to talk all macho, “shake
him out, little bad boy.” Whatever – you’re not an action hero, tough
guy, you’re not a gangster –</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Flinchy. That’s what I thought. Shut up. Call
me when you see this guy – check him out see what’s what. She asked him
for seven fifty when she was on the phone with him, so – just call me
when you get there.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: This is this place called Ace Vintage, you
gotta find it, I don’t know exactly where this is and I don’t understand
these maps so just go there and check it out. It’s a ’61 AC Cobra that
this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he’s only asking
23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it
seems alright then I’ll head down there and check it out.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Can we maybe ask for more money on this?</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: …because it’s California? I mean it’s like a
nine or ten hour drive. It’s not like going to Salt Lake and getting the
Mormon’s, it’s different…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: It’s Barry.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: So I want to tell you something, I gotta tell
you: I saw a picture of you guys, your sisters and you and I saw your
picture and I really wanted to meet you. I came to drop my car off there
on purpose, to try and meet you.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: …really? That’s nice…are you lying?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: …I thought I should tell you. I didn’t want to
get too far along on going out and be hiding something –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s very nice. Thank you. Thank you for
saying that. You’re friends with my sister?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: How long have you known her?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: About six months.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You like her?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah. Yeah we get along well. You didn’t get
along with her very well?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Did you really come to meet me on purpose or
are you lying about that?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: No, no. I did.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s nice. It’s nice. I’ve been looking
around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by
some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: So that pudding was bought, I bought that
pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that’s sponsored by
Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It’s designed to encourage airline
travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice
products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups
and ice creams, this sort of thing…..</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….I’m sorry….I lost my thoughts, what I was
saying….</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You were talking about the promotion –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: – the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy
Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for
purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice
their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at
$1.79 - that’s a pretty good deal….but then I noticed they had soup at
89 cents a can…..and you start to do the math and you start to notice
that it’s a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at
25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label.
That’s those little bar codes, you know? The universal product
codes?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s what’s used to redeem the mileage, so
in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code – in other
words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles.
Add in the coupon: it’s one thousand. You see?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You see?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah, no, I see –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on
pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: That’s insane. That is really, really crazy.
That’s just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….yeah….</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: So that was your pudding?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….No….</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I’m sorry. I thought you said –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I thought you said you bought all that pudding
–</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: My friend Carlos is doing it who works with
me. It’s his. It’s his pudding, he’s doing it. It’s not mine. He’s
crazy. I told him not to do it. He’s the one who’s insane. He only spent
about one hundred dollars so far though –</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Your sister was telling me a pretty funny
story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp
for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You
threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t remember that, she might be lying. I
have to go the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>lena &amp; barry</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sir, can I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Just have you for one second, please.</p>
<p><strong>angle, off to the side.</strong>: The Manager and Barry step
away, in a quiet section of the restaraunt, 2-shot, profile, in sotto;
SLOW ZOOM IN.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You didn’t just smash up the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Well who did?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You’re hand is bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I cut myself.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: On my knife.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I didn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Why? …what?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Your hand is bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sir, I have no way of proving that you
demolished the bathroom –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Alright, well you’re gonna have to leave.
You’re gonna have to go.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah, but I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’m gonna call the police then, sir.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Please don’t do this to me.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: The police are on their way.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our
drinks and salad?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Keep the change, please.</p>
<p><strong>angle, back at the table.</strong>: They walk back to the
table and Barry whispers down to her, very close, STEADICAM</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: We should go I think, I don’t like it
here.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Is everything ok?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I have a better idea of where we can go.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: There’s a better place for us to eat.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Did something happen; are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes I’m fine. Everything is ok. It’s fine.
Everything is fine.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: So….how is your harmonium doing?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Your portable reed organ….the piano.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Well, it’s fine. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Did you pick it up from the street?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Did you take it from the street in front of
your work?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: …yes I did…?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Are you learning how to play it?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes? I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Oh that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: So you must travel a lot with all that pudding
you bought?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes no not really.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok….well…I’m gonna go.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: …yeah…</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: It was nice to see you again, to see your
face again, to go out with you –</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I’ll be around and back in town in a few days
–</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: If you come to Hawaii –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah, I don’t know, we’ll see about that.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You don’t think you’ll go –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean,
I’ll call you when I get back. I’ll be back for three weeks and then I
go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time….</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok. Have a good trip.</p>
<p><strong>reception woman</strong>: Are you Barry?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>reception woman</strong>: It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: This is Barry.</p>

<p><strong>david</strong>: No, no, no, no c’mon man, don’t make it a

<p><strong>david</strong>: You have another house somewhere or

<p><strong>barry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>mike d</strong>: This is three hundred and twenty. Let’s just
go to your ATM and that’ll be it –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I didn’t promise her money. She said that it
was confidential, this isn’t fair –</p>
<p><strong>mike d</strong>: Shut up, be quiet. Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: – don’t –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now
you’re gonna pay. It’s not a big thing – just give us some money and
then it’s over – we’ll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out
–</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Alright, alright.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: How do you want to do this?</p>
<p><strong>mike d</strong>: Let’s just go to the corner, we saw a place
on the corner, you’ll just get your max out and that’s it – you get out
what you can and that’s it –</p>
<p><strong>angle, the brothers.</strong>: CAMERA SLOWLY PUSHES IN on the
three of them watching Barry.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ok. This is what you get when you’re a
pervert – you said you’d help someone out and you didn’t so we’re just
getting some money for her and that’s that.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You know, please, I just wanna say that I
didn’t say I would help her out; I was very clear about it….I don’t
think that this is fair…..wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch…..</p>
<p><strong>flash</strong>: Their UTAH license plate……</p>
<p><strong>mike d</strong>: You don’t challenge what my brother’s
saying, you don’t say that –</p>
<p><strong>angle, barry. - various alley way/street shots.</strong>: He
turns some corners…..makes his way down a side street and through an
alley or two….and then he’s running like a mad man as fast as he can
down the street……</p>
<p><strong>mike d</strong>: Where the fuck are you going?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: …what the hell?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I think I got in trouble. A little bit of
trouble….</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….I made a call….. ….and, uh….</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: …ok…..ok……I gotta get some pudding to go

<p><strong>worker</strong>: Telephone on Line One, Barry.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>rhonda</strong>: I need to talk to you about your behavior
the other night –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok. Well. I’m gonna go out of town. I’m going
to go out of town just for two days…</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Where you goin?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m going to go to Hawaii but you can’t tell
my sisters that.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Wow, you’re goin’ to Hawaii, that’s great –
you’re goin – ?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah but you can’t tell my sisters that.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Alright: And I have to go and buy some more
pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I’m
realizing it sounds a little strange but it’s not. So can you come and
help me out?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I saw the Teriyaki Chicken first and that was
$1.79 and then the Soup which made a real deal but then to come across
the pudding…it’s just tremendous when you think about how most people
just don’t look…they don’t….they’re not looking at the fine print,
Lance.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: They need to be scanned individually. They
each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and
every cup appears on the receipt…</p>
<p><strong>check out girl</strong>: What is this, man?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>check out girl</strong>: Are you serious with this?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>check out girl</strong>: Well….what do you want, then?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Each pudding cup has to be scanned
individually so that…it’s for a giveaway…a product giveaway by this
company…</p>
<p><strong>check out girl</strong>: This is a bunch of bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m sorry, I know. I know that it’s….</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Sorry. I’m sorry, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: God Damn They’re So Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You know you can get places in the world with
pudding. That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I guess they’re not open today.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s fine. I think I have enough.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I get really sick of myself sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It
doesn’t state anywhere about six to eight weeks.</p>
<p><strong>operator voice</strong>: It takes that much time to process
the order and make sure it’s valid –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I had this whole thing in my head, I was
gonna be able to get this to you today – I have to leave today –</p>
<p><strong>operator voice</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: How am I supposed to know what to do if you
don’t say it – if it’s not in your rules and regulations in your fine
print how am I supposed to know how to be with this –</p>
<p><strong>operator voice</strong>: It takes time to process –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Don’t do that. Don’t do that. That’s not
right. Calm down now, please. Please. Ok. Ok. Calm down now please.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok: the pudding is gonna take six to eight
weeks to process so that isn’t gonna work for today, I’ll just take a
bath on that today. Ok. But here’s the thing I gotta tell you:</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….now: this pudding?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Let’s just figure that out later – Ok. I
gotta go. I’m just gonna go now and I’ll call you from there, you’re in
charge ’till I get back. And don’t tell my sisters anything?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’ve never been on a plane before.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What’s that sound?</p>
<p><strong>cab driver</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Hey. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Nothing. I’m just at work and I’m wondering,
you know your friend Lena?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What about her? You didn’t ask her out,
you’re such a pussy –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….she didn’t, I didn’t ask her out?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You’re so scared.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Do you know where she’s staying in
Hawaii?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she
is, why?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ……she forgot her purse at my work and I
wanted to get it back to her.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: No she didn’t; that’s a lie.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I….please don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What? Tell me why you wanna know –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I just want to know where she’s staying.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Tell me why.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: There is no reason for you to treat me like
you do – you’re killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are
towards me –</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: – what are you talking about, come on
–</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: – all I want is the number of where she’s
staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me
this way, please – Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think
I will kill you if you don’t.</p>

this?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s not true. That’s not true at all. You

confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for
money, c’mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever
runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: Can you hang on a second?</p>
<p><strong>worker</strong>: Dean, line one….</p>

<p><strong>dean</strong>: Put him through.</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: No, no. This is bad, something might have
happened, we should just –</p>

matter, just shut up –</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: Ok, sir….I’m gonna put you through to my
supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Fine, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: Ok. You’re connected.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called
your service –</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Why don’t you shut the fuck up?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I said calm down and shut the fuck up. What’s
your problem?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I haven’t even told you what’s happened. Your
girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men
just chased me – extorted money –</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Go fuck yourself that shit doesn’t have
anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Now are you threatening me, dick?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a
bad person and you have no right to take people’s confidence in your
service –</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You better watch your mouth, cunt, you’re
gonna get hurt.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: I’ll say whatever I want –</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You just told me to fuck off. That wasn’t
good. You’re dead.</p>

<p><strong>barry</strong>: Somewhere in Utah.</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: What’s the listing?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: D&amp;D Mattress Man.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: May I help you?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m looking for the Mattress Man.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Whoever owns this.</p>
<p><strong>employee</strong>: In the back…..</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m a nice and reasonable man. I didn’t do
anything wrong. Please don’t make me hurt you. And I’m telling you: that
if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love…..I will hurt you
many, many, many times over…..because it’s not right to take people’s
trust.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: You came all the way from Los Angeles to tell
me that?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes I did.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Can we agree that that is that?</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s that.</p>

I’ll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Lena I’m so sorry. I’m so sorry that I left
you at the hospital….. I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex
line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me
and you got hurt and I’m sorry – and I had to leave because I don’t want
you to get hurt again and now I’m here and I’m back and I have a lot of
pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that
much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go
if you have to travel for your job because I don’t want to be anywhere
without you…..can you please let me redeem the mileage?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You left me at the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok.</p>

<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m looking at your advertisement for the
airline promotion and giveaway?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: This is “Fly With Us?”</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: It’s hard to understand because it says in
addition to but I can’t exactly understand in addition to what because
there’s actually nothing to add it too…</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: I think that’s a type-o then, that would
be a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: So, just to clarify, I’m sorry: Ten purchases
of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and
then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles
–</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Do you realize that the monetary value of
this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the
purchases?</p>

questions…? Can I get your extension?</p>
<p><strong>operator</strong>: It’s extension 215 if you want to try me
back.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….I’m not exactly sure what that means…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: If they break or something. What is it,
plastic?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: It’s a plastic, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Right. Alright, lemme call you first thing
tomorrow, I’m gonna run the numbers, see what’s what and I’ll give you a
call back –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Did you have my home phone number?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: If you wanted to call me back I could…</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: I’m fine, I have your work number.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok…because of the time difference if you
needed to call me early?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: It’s fine. I can just get you at your

them to them? BARRY Ok.</p>

there?</p>

be myself if that happens.</p>

<p><strong>barry</strong>: I feel really on the spot now.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Are you gonna do it?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t do that. I don’t - things like
that.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: You don’t do anything, why are you being
scared?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m not being scared, you’re just going to
rag me if I do this –</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’m not gonna rag you. Why would I do
this just to rag you?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: I’ll leave then, I’ll go to get something
from my car, go away so you don’t feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious
question:</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?
Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What’s wrong with you?
Are you ok?</p>

<p><strong>regular joe</strong>: Take it easy, man, relax. Don’t – DEAN
I’ll relax your fucking head – this is my personal space, man, this is

<p><strong>latisha</strong>: Uch. Shut up, Dean.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: You don’t need to talk all macho, “shake
him out, little bad boy.” Whatever – you’re not an action hero, tough
guy, you’re not a gangster –</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: Flinchy. That’s what I thought. Shut up. Call
me when you see this guy – check him out see what’s what. She asked him
for seven fifty when she was on the phone with him, so – just call me
when you get there.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: This is this place called Ace Vintage, you
gotta find it, I don’t know exactly where this is and I don’t understand
these maps so just go there and check it out. It’s a ’61 AC Cobra that
this old guy says is fine, but I need to figure out why he’s only asking
23 for it. So take a look, the whole thing, call me about that, if it
seems alright then I’ll head down there and check it out.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>dean</strong>: That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Can we maybe ask for more money on this?</p>
<p><strong>latisha</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: …because it’s California? I mean it’s like a
nine or ten hour drive. It’s not like going to Salt Lake and getting the
Mormon’s, it’s different…</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: It’s Barry.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: So I want to tell you something, I gotta tell
you: I saw a picture of you guys, your sisters and you and I saw your
picture and I really wanted to meet you. I came to drop my car off there
on purpose, to try and meet you.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: …really? That’s nice…are you lying?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: …I thought I should tell you. I didn’t want to
get too far along on going out and be hiding something –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s very nice. Thank you. Thank you for
saying that. You’re friends with my sister?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: How long have you known her?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: About six months.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You like her?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah. Yeah we get along well. You didn’t get
along with her very well?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Did you really come to meet me on purpose or
are you lying about that?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: No, no. I did.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s nice. It’s nice. I’ve been looking
around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by
some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: So that pudding was bought, I bought that
pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that’s sponsored by
Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It’s designed to encourage airline
travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice
products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups
and ice creams, this sort of thing…..</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….I’m sorry….I lost my thoughts, what I was
saying….</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You were talking about the promotion –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: – the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy
Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for
purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice
their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at
$1.79 - that’s a pretty good deal….but then I noticed they had soup at
89 cents a can…..and you start to do the math and you start to notice
that it’s a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at
25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label.
That’s those little bar codes, you know? The universal product
codes?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s what’s used to redeem the mileage, so
in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code – in other
words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles.
Add in the coupon: it’s one thousand. You see?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You see?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Yeah, no, I see –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You see if you spent $3,000 dollars on
pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: That’s insane. That is really, really crazy.
That’s just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….yeah….</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: So that was your pudding?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….No….</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I’m sorry. I thought you said –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I thought you said you bought all that pudding
–</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: My friend Carlos is doing it who works with
me. It’s his. It’s his pudding, he’s doing it. It’s not mine. He’s
crazy. I told him not to do it. He’s the one who’s insane. He only spent
about one hundred dollars so far though –</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Your sister was telling me a pretty funny
story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp
for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You
threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t remember that, she might be lying. I
have to go the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>lena &amp; barry</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sir, can I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Just have you for one second, please.</p>
<p><strong>angle, off to the side.</strong>: The Manager and Barry step
away, in a quiet section of the restaraunt, 2-shot, profile, in sotto;
SLOW ZOOM IN.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sir, the bathroom was just torn apart.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You didn’t just smash up the bathroom?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Well who did?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: You’re hand is bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I cut myself.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: On my knife.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the
bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I didn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Why? …what?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Your hand is bleeding.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Sir, I have no way of proving that you
demolished the bathroom –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I didn’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: Alright, well you’re gonna have to leave.
You’re gonna have to go.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah, but I didn’t do anything.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: I’m gonna call the police then, sir.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Please don’t do this to me.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: The police are on their way.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our
drinks and salad?</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: That’s fine.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Keep the change, please.</p>
<p><strong>angle, back at the table.</strong>: They walk back to the
table and Barry whispers down to her, very close, STEADICAM</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: We should go I think, I don’t like it
here.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Is everything ok?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: What did he want?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I have a better idea of where we can go.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: There’s a better place for us to eat.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Did something happen; are you alright?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes I’m fine. Everything is ok. It’s fine.
Everything is fine.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: So….how is your harmonium doing?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Your portable reed organ….the piano.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Well, it’s fine. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Did you pick it up from the street?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Did you take it from the street in front of
your work?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: …yes I did…?</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Are you learning how to play it?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes? I’m trying.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Oh that’s great.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: So you must travel a lot with all that pudding
you bought?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes no not really.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok….well…I’m gonna go.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: …yeah…</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: It was nice to see you again, to see your
face again, to go out with you –</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: I’ll be around and back in town in a few days
–</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: If you come to Hawaii –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah, I don’t know, we’ll see about that.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: You don’t think you’ll go –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>lena</strong>: Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean,
I’ll call you when I get back. I’ll be back for three weeks and then I
go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time….</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok. Have a good trip.</p>
<p><strong>reception woman</strong>: Are you Barry?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>reception woman</strong>: It’s for you.</p>

<p><strong>mike d</strong>: This is three hundred and twenty. Let’s just
go to your ATM and that’ll be it –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I didn’t promise her money. She said that it
was confidential, this isn’t fair –</p>
<p><strong>mike d</strong>: Shut up, be quiet. Be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: – don’t –</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now
you’re gonna pay. It’s not a big thing – just give us some money and
then it’s over – we’ll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out
–</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Alright, alright.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: How do you want to do this?</p>
<p><strong>mike d</strong>: Let’s just go to the corner, we saw a place
on the corner, you’ll just get your max out and that’s it – you get out

<p><strong>angle, the brothers.</strong>: CAMERA SLOWLY PUSHES IN on the
three of them watching Barry.</p>
<p><strong>david</strong>: Ok. This is what you get when you’re a
pervert – you said you’d help someone out and you didn’t so we’re just
getting some money for her and that’s that.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You know, please, I just wanna say that I
didn’t say I would help her out; I was very clear about it….I don’t
think that this is fair…..wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch…..</p>
<p><strong>mike d</strong>: You don’t challenge what my brother’s
saying, you don’t say that –</p>
<p><strong>angle, barry. - various alley way/street shots.</strong>: He
turns some corners…..makes his way down a side street and through an
alley or two….and then he’s running like a mad man as fast as he can
down the street……</p>
<p><strong>mike d</strong>: Where the fuck are you going?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: …what the hell?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: What’s up?</p>

my sisters that.</p>

you’re goin – ?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yeah but you can’t tell my sisters that.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Alright: And I have to go and buy some more
pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I’m
realizing it sounds a little strange but it’s not. So can you come and
help me out?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Ok.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I saw the Teriyaki Chicken first and that was
$1.79 and then the Soup which made a real deal but then to come across
the pudding…it’s just tremendous when you think about how most people
just don’t look…they don’t….they’re not looking at the fine print,
Lance.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: They need to be scanned individually. They
each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and
every cup appears on the receipt…</p>
<p><strong>check out girl</strong>: What is this, man?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>check out girl</strong>: Are you serious with this?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Yes. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>check out girl</strong>: Well….what do you want, then?</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Each pudding cup has to be scanned
individually so that…it’s for a giveaway…a product giveaway by this
company…</p>
<p><strong>check out girl</strong>: This is a bunch of bullshit.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m sorry, I know. I know that it’s….</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’m sorry, I’m really sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Sorry. I’m sorry, ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: God Damn They’re So Beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: You know you can get places in the world with
pudding. That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s funny.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I guess they’re not open today.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: That’s fine. I think I have enough.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I get really sick of myself sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It
doesn’t state anywhere about six to eight weeks.</p>
<p><strong>operator voice</strong>: It takes that much time to process
the order and make sure it’s valid –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I had this whole thing in my head, I was
gonna be able to get this to you today – I have to leave today –</p>
<p><strong>operator voice</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: How am I supposed to know what to do if you
don’t say it – if it’s not in your rules and regulations in your fine
print how am I supposed to know how to be with this –</p>
<p><strong>operator voice</strong>: It takes time to process –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Don’t do that. Don’t do that. That’s not
right. Calm down now, please. Please. Ok. Ok. Calm down now please.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Ok: the pudding is gonna take six to eight
weeks to process so that isn’t gonna work for today, I’ll just take a
bath on that today. Ok. But here’s the thing I gotta tell you:</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: ….now: this pudding?</p>
<p><strong>lance</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: Let’s just figure that out later – Ok. I
gotta go. I’m just gonna go now and I’ll call you from there, you’re in
charge ’till I get back. And don’t tell my sisters anything? He
exits.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I’ve never been on a plane before.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: What’s that sound?</p>
<p><strong>he wells with tears and a smile, cringes in his face and
we</strong>: SEE THE BUILD UP OF EMOTION, HIS VEINS POP FROM HIS FACE

<p><strong>barry</strong>: I….please don’t do this.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: What? Tell me why you wanna know –</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: I just want to know where she’s staying.</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: Tell me why.</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: There is no reason for you to treat me like
you do – you’re killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are
towards me –</p>
<p><strong>elizabeth</strong>: – what are you talking about, come on
–</p>
<p><strong>barry</strong>: – all I want is the number of where she’s
staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me
this way, please – Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think
I will kill you if you don’t.</p>
