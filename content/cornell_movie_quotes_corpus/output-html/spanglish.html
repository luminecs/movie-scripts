<p><strong>1 int. bedroom - medium close - male form - late afternoon
1</strong>: A shape fills the lower portion of the screen. It is a man’s
back….. a perfect back… good dark color, slim, muscular. LATIN MUSIC
PLAYS… a song…. if you understood the words you would hear love
confronted and considered in a very specific way…We are in a Mexico City
suburb. The day is hot; small beads of sweat are seen on the man’s back,
the first indication that we are in slow motion..Perfect red fingernails
come into view…and now a woman’s hand goes beautifully to work…part
sensual back scratch, part massage. The hand cups bits of the man’s
back, a strong thumb probes his spine, a long finger teases the very top
of his ass in a cute finger-pirouette and then continues down – and, as
the hand rises once more to the top of his back for another trip down
his upper body…</p>
<p><strong>main titles begin</strong>: Full titles, minute after minute
of titles with some key dissolves helping us to represent some 30
minutes of time passage as the hand continues to scratch and rub, the
man making sounds of pleasure. The hand is getting tired. Flirtatious no
more, this is getting to be work…The unseen woman shakes the hand
vigorously, the man says a single sound urging her to continue, the
exhausted hand complies, then stops, then the unseen woman changes hands
as TITLES CONTINUE…..The new hand, wearing a wedding ring, goes to work
then it too stops to rest..the man says something in Spanish…important
for us because it will establish that there will be no subtitles and yet
we understand perfectly that he is asking her to continue. She replies
in Spanish lightheartedly, with a small and pretty laugh, that her hands
are tired. We understand. The man tells her to continue. She continues,
the rub now desultory and resentful. She stops for another rest. The man
wants more and grabs forcibly at her hand – his own hand coming into
view for the first time. She says, in Spanish, with no particular anger,
“you said you would never push me around again. If you do, I will
somehow break your arm so you can rub your own back as high as you
want.” be worked hard to provide something extra for the Spanish For
now, the man’s tone changes, placating her to continue. Even as she
resumes the massage they begin to have a domestic argument in Spanish.
This is no longer a massage we envy. This back rub, going as it does
from sex and hope to discord and alienation, will be our only full
direct knowledge of their marriage.</p>
<p><strong>2 int./ext. bedroom / dusty road - other angle 2</strong>:
Showing us the room and beyond, through the window, a school bus
stopping at the corner on a dusty road. We now see the full figure of
the woman’s back as she looks up with excitement and stops rubbing with
the word,</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. dusty road - the bus 3</strong>: As CRISTINA, six
years old and adorable, waits patiently to step down. She sees her
mother and grins and waves excitedly, digging into her little pack to
pull out an English book which she displays with pride. Now she steps
down from the bus and, as she walks TOWARD CAMERA, narration begins. The
voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: To Princeton University’s Director of
Admissions: In considering me for a scholarship you have asked for, and
have every reason to expect, an essay from me about myself. And, as a
clever high school graduate, I of course realize the subtext of this
essay about who I am and why I want to enter Princeton, is actually to
make clear to you why you should have me. I have gotten tips, from
friends who have preceded me to college, that being a Latina, with my
grades, list of activities and relative poverty, I am as good as in if I
simply do the dance and work in a word like “bipolarization” every so
often. And while I love dances – this dance of self is one I am afraid
to master. I prefer to write about my mother.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. / ext. house - school girl’s pov - mom 4</strong>: A
drop-dead gorgeous Latin woman in her early 20’s. As mother and daughter
move inside, a car pulls up with an ominous man getting out. He nods in
another direction calling our attention to a police car parked off the
street. The woman does not notice - instead shepherding the child to her
father. The woman makes a big fuss over the text books the child
has..this is one supportive mom..again she is disbelieving that her
husband shows no interest, especially when the child seems briefly hurt.
The woman’s husband looks from the window and sees the ominous man
coming. The woman now does everything humanly possible to distract the
child so she does not see what is transpiring.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: For my mother, that afternoon eleven years
ago was a watershed not because of my father’s</p>
<p><strong>5 int. kitchen / husband’s room - late afternoon 5</strong>:
This room is directly across from the husband’s room. The woman looks up
to see her husband open the suitcase to show the man a huge store of
Mont Blanc pens and high-end watches. The man gives her husband some
money..all the time the woman is chattering to distract the girl.
Looking off –the woman grows wide-eyed as she sees her husband count
some money. The undercover cop begins shouting orders. The woman raises
her voice to cover the argument in the next room which puzzles her
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: There was never any pretense that the
gorgeous, vital, clever, temperamental animal that was my mother ever
for a heartbeat considered having any life of her own. She ignored all
her needs and was alive only for me. It was terrific. At the time.</p>
<p><strong>on mom.</strong>: As she watches her daughter chew a cookie.
Her daughter begins to tell about her day, her young mother taking on a
glow we have not yet seen. And all the while she eyes the action in the
next room. Her husband makes a break for the window. The other man
points a gun at the ceiling preparing to fire a warning shot. The woman
moves ever so quickly to a shelf of her favorite dishes, all the while
talking to her daughter, making much over the kid’s new school books. It
is an impressive charade.</p>
<p><strong>full shot - taking in both rooms.</strong>: And just as the
cop shoots at the ceiling, in perfect timing, she upsets the dishes, the
resulting noise covering the shot.. The woman asks her daughter what she
learned today..the daughter says she was taught a little English. Mother
is impressed as she watches the cop move her husband toward the front
door where other police await. Her daughter starts to follow her gaze
and she distracts her..brandishing the Spanish/English book and asking
her to say something.</p>
<p><strong>6 int. / ext. kitchen - on girl. 6</strong>: Standing
proudly, smoothing her skirt.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mother</strong>: Una l�grima…sola una sola…Haz la mejor
possible.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: “One tear..only one…so make it a good
one.” This was my mother’s instruction to me.</p>
<p><strong>on child.</strong>: Baffled by the edict..</p>
<p><strong>on mother.</strong>: Holding up one finger. That’s it..one
tear..she means it.</p>
<p><strong>on child..</strong>: As she complies..one great tear forming
and falling..Her mother’s thumb wipes it away..But now her eyes well
with more tears..her mother gestures she must have strength and
resolve..and so she does..a toss of her pretty little head…the eyes
clear.</p>
<p><strong>7 int. mother’s bedroom - night 7</strong>: As the mother,
lying in bed with her daughter loses her own fight with tears..managing
with difficulty to keep her convulsive sobs silent since her daughter
and she are intertwined like pretzels.</p>
<p><strong>8 int. girl’s room - day 8</strong>: The girl works on her
lesson plan..She is a study in beauty. Her mother’s daughter. Across the
small hallway her mother greets and deals with friends and family in
a:</p>
<p><strong>9 series of shots 9</strong>: As the girl works..her dress
changing as the days change while different visitors listen hard to her
mother across the hall.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: My mother dealt with our considerable
problems of survival by talking..Always she discovered her own best
thoughts by sifting through her own words.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Each night my mother promised me a
wonderful life.. Each night I looked for a new expressive way to tell my
mother how much I loved her.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I just played and did my lessons and every
time I looked up my mother was in the process of saving us.</p>
<p><strong>11 int. / ext. montage - various shots 11</strong>: Her
mother selling keepsakes..counting money..Friends and relatives bringing
food, clothing - toys.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Desperation in her hands was our
weapon.</p>
<p><strong>on mother..</strong>: We see her totally intimidating a
priest.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: With this weapon she had her marriage
annulled - usually impossible for the poor - and somehow convinced an
associate of my father’s to transport two Mexicans North in style.</p>
<p><strong>12 int. small airplane - magic hour 12</strong>: The mother
and daughter seating themselves. The mother is enormously nervous with
the prospect of flight. She sits, the daughter ignores an empty seat and
goes on her lap, mother hugging daughter, daughter hugging the hug.</p>
<p><strong>american pilot</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Hi. How are you? I am fine.. ..happy, merry,
joyful, glad, contented, frisky.</p>
<p><strong>american pilot</strong>: Are you her mother,
sister..what?</p>
<p><strong>13 ext. aerial shot.. 13</strong>: The plane crossing the Rio
Grande.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: My mother’s prayer for us, which she made
me repeat exactly, represented a stunning look into our future. “Please
God, let only the bad things change.”</p>
<p><strong>14 int. small plane - close on the two females.. 14</strong>:
Use this image if ever you want to strike a coin depicting the moment of
no return. The child aglow with happy anticipation..the adult brave and
enormously anxious.</p>
<p><strong>other angle.</strong>: The pilot taken with the mother’s
looks.</p>
<p><strong>american pilot</strong>: How can I reach you? Address?
Telephone? Por favor. Por favor.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: My mother had redefined her own passions.
Blaming herself for the father she gave me, she would never again be
lured by a man’s rough edges..She had decided that goodness would be her
catnip.</p>
<p><strong>on mother..</strong>: As she feels him looking at her and
turns. With some affection and regret, she shakes her head, “no.”</p>
<p><strong>the pilot.</strong>: As he mouths the word “ouch.”</p>
<p><strong>15 ext. field - night… 15</strong>: Plane landing on a dirt
and grass strip…</p>
<p><strong>16 ext. field - later - night - on mother and daughter..
16</strong>: Standing on the tarmac..Latin flavored music suddenly gives
way to a Texas country harmonica riff..The child tries to comfort her
apprehensive mother with the one wondrous fact she finds so
thrilling.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Texas…</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Texas.</p>
<p><strong>17 ext. elevated high shot…highway 17</strong>: The two of
them waiting, small figures.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Mam�, Texas..</p>
<p><strong>18 ext. highway - dusk 18</strong>: Bus traveling the
highway. The child looks out sadly.</p>
<p><strong>girl</strong>: Adios, Texas.</p>
<p><strong>19 ext. north valley street - early evening 19</strong>: As
they disembark…the mother studying a slip of paper…fearing she has made
the mistake of a lifetime. The child fascinated by all.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: At the time, I was oblivious to my
mother’s anguish. She loved and lived to talk. Now, as if by a witch’s
spell, words were no longer her bridge but her barrier. In a very real
sense she feared she had left herself behind.</p>
<p><strong>on the two females.</strong>: The mother sees something. Joy
returns.</p>
<p><strong>her pov.</strong>: A street full of stores with SIGNS IN
SPANISH..She begins walking the street asking passers-by for directions
in Spanish and is answered..her step lightens..she beams with relief. So
far so very, very good.</p>
<p><strong>20 ext. apt. complex - day - five months later.. 20</strong>:
An iron gate in front..small courtyard ringed by a second floor
horseshoe of apartments.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: We moved into a place managed by my
mother’s aunt. My mother worked two jobs in two local stores paying a
total of 450 dollars a week…</p>
<p><strong>21 int. apt. - day 21</strong>: As the mother enters.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: ..just ever so barely enough.</p>
<p><strong>22 int. apt. - kitchen - closer shot.. 22</strong>: Cristina
taking a newspaper from her book bag and seriously pondering - then
circling grocery coupons.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: But we were fine. We had it down. If only
I could have stayed six.</p>
<p><strong>23 ext. apt. complex - elevated shot - six years later.
23</strong>: The courtyard is lit with colored lights and candles..a
wedding reception is in progress -</p>
<p><strong>extreme close up - the bride.</strong>: Gorgeous round and
full cheeks stretched into a deep, explosive smile. BACK TO SCENE… music
plays and we focus on Cristina, now nearing 12 years of age..dancing
with her mother and some other smaller children.. The mother eyes the
muscular back of a Great Looking Man…who turns, and quickly oozes
quality sex appeal. She is turned on..They talk in Spanish…him saying
something hushed like, “I have been afraid to talk to you. I need oxygen
when I look at you.” She indicates the six children she is dancing with
and offers to include him in some ring around the rosey dance…He
indicates the magic of just the two of them…She quickly leads her little
flock away..</p>
<p><strong>other angle..</strong>: A reed-thin FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY is
staring at them…at first the mother thinks this is adorable…the child
eyeing her as if he were a man..she indicates he should join the rest of
the children for a dance..</p>
<p><strong>moving with the boy..</strong>: As he steps forward and it
becomes clear it is Cristina he is interested in… Before the mom can do
anything about it, he asks Cristina to dance and she readily
accepts.</p>
<p><strong>on cristina..</strong>: Satellite virginities falling with
alarming speed..the first time held by a male, the first time held
close, the first sexy gaze from half-closed male eyes which utterly
confuses Cristina. He begins to grind his hips into his dancing
partner.</p>
<p><strong>on her mother.</strong>: Not confused. It is exactly as if
she sees her daughter about to be run down by a car..only this time the
thing to do is scare the car.</p>
<p><strong>cristina.</strong>: Somewhat proud of her mom as the boy
leaves the scene.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: That quickly it was clear she could no
longer work two jobs and leave me to my own at night. The following
morning she did something about it. A boy I never saw again had changed
our lives.</p>
<p><strong>24 int. bus - day 24</strong>: The mother and her aunt,
MONICA, take their seats..the bus is filled with domestics..the mother,
nervous, looks over to see and greet… THE BRIDE from last night’s
wedding.</p>
<p><strong>bride</strong>: Este es Stone Canyon.</p>
<p><strong>26 ext. stone canyon - day 26</strong>: MUSIC CHANGE..as they
disembark and start walking, joining the busload of domestics into the
canyon and up the hill….they walk past a perfect country club fairway.
Grand trees from either side meet each other high over the road.</p>
<p><strong>on our gal..as they walk</strong>: She sees the stuff…the
dream that makes you migrate. She is not awed..she is jazzed. To her
aunt she does the Latin version of OH…..MY…GOD!!!!!!!!…At regular
intervals in the background, one black SUV after another has a mother
taking kids home from school.</p>
<p><strong>27 ext. attractive home security gate - day 27</strong>:
Monica presses the security intercom. The gate swings open.</p>
<p><strong>28 ext. house - day. 28</strong>: In the foreground an
expanse of turned up dirt…and huge rolls of sod ready to be laid down. A
catering truck stands in the driveway.</p>
<p><strong>29 int. / ext. house - great kitchen / pool - day
29</strong>: They enter..lots of glass French doors STAND OPEN to lawn,
pool and pool house. They look off.</p>
<p><strong>their pov.</strong>: DEBORAH NORWICH CLASKY, a cool beauty in
her mid 30’s, sits dominating this three generation portrait of the Good
Life. She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt..She is a
perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she doesn’t care, while
every article is a true and gifted find. She is drinking from a tumbler
which is also of the “don’t hold your breath while you try to find
something as terrific” variety. She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN,
60, who is drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year
old overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her grandmother idly
holding her hand..In the immediate area more rolls of sod wait to be
laid.</p>
<p><strong>the two latinas.</strong>: As they stand inside the kitchen
not sure what to do next. Then Deborah gestures that they should join
her at the pool..as they start out..</p>
<p><strong>their exit.</strong>: Boink..three stooges retro..those
French doors were not open after all. Monica hits first. The women at
the pool react. Deborah and Bernice running. Evelyn momentarily attempts
to join the rush.. she half rises and then thinks better of it..too late
in the day for sudden movements.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Gee whiz in heaven…How are you? Please?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Don’t worry..I’m not mad…I was looking for
decoration to put on the glass so people would stop walking into it and
instead of taking what they had in stock, which was awful, I special
ordered. I’ll design something myself which I should have done in the
fi…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: ..and what difference does that make when
your nose is bleeding. Shut up, Deborah.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Now you got it, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Here, take these. Was that strange to give
you money..I just felt badly that..</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>30 ext. house - backyard - day 30</strong>: Moments later. As
the group arrives at the outdoor table. Evelyn makes half-hearted
incomplete gestures of shaking hands, nodding, indicating a seat…each
simple act a test which she fails – every gesture a bit too late and
then some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under her
belt. In the background workers roll out sod, the yard becoming more
beautiful even as we look.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: She is my niece. She and her daughter live
in the apartment I manage. Yolanda, who worked for you, lived there
before she went back home. That’s how I heard about the job.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: So who am I interviewing?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Her.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You’re gorgeous.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Vistosos.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: She doesn’t mean it as a compliment. It’s
more of an accusation.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: This is my daughter Bernice and this is my
mother, Evelyn Norwich..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Excuse me…Glad you’re okay. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: No, stay..this involves you.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I wouldn’t want some kid around for my
interview. You understand, Mom.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Strength of character..empathy..big
heart..taste for futility - God I love you.</p>
<p><strong>mother!</strong>: Stop. It’s just a conversation - not an
interview. Please sit. Don’t you want to get out of the sun?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You guys want some lemonade? Let’s just
talk. I have two children. My husband works nights..he’s a chef and has
his own place.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Do you work?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I helped run a commercial design company
until ten months ago when</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: it was downsized to zip. Okay. I have two
children. I like the house to be like me in that I’m very loose and
meticulous at the same time. It’s all about first names and closeness
here but I care about the place, you know. It’s what they used to call
homemaker..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I’m not leaving time for you to
translate.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Too bad for you that it just never occurred
to you to check on how much Spanish I know.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: I’m sorry what I say about you…don’t hold it
against her.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Mom!!</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I don’t speak any Spanish. But I’m not an
idiot - I talk for an hour and you say two words. What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Never mind. You got your nose bopped. I got
my feelings hurt. Onward.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I will major in linguistics and make
sociology my sub- concentration. Because it has been my experience that
the barriers of</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What’s your name? Llamo? One of my five
Spanish words..</p>
<p><strong>our gal</strong>: Flor Moreno.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Flor.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Florrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Flor.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Florrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Flor.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Florrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Flor.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Florrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Flor..what I walk on?</p>
<p><strong>monica and evelyn</strong>: Florrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Florrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: It means flower, right?</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Yes. Flower. Florrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Florrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Florrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Is there some school of the ear I’m
flunking out of right now?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What did she say?</p>
<p><strong>close on flor…</strong>: She feels the tension but, so far in
her life, her own irrepressible personality has served her - so she
moves forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance. She
tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the first time, she
is, through Monica, talking directly to Deborah.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: She says..If you curl your tongue and let it
be loose you will have it..that it’s hard for Americans.. She says it’s
great that you try so hard. Many people wouldn’t bother.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: pronouncement/her</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You want some lemonade? Take some
lemonade.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Florrrrr.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Sublime.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Whew, dense but stubborn, right? Thanks.
What you just did with me is just what kids need..patience and
encouragement. Alright, money…</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Goodbye, really.. Look forward to seeing
you.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Love you… … the job is six days a week,
seven to seven..the kids and all housekeeping, how much a week would you
like?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: No.. This is an important question..if you
ask for too little it means you don’t value</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: One thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>other angle..</strong>: As Monica uses Deborah’s reaction
time to, in mid-laugh, flash four fingers to Flor..</p>
<p><strong>on evelyn.</strong>: Catching the gesture and secretly
indicating to Monica they should go for six.</p>
<p><strong>monica</strong>: Six hundred dollars.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Welcome to the family..</p>
<p><strong>31 ext. clasky house - day. 31</strong>: As Flor and Monica
exit and can finally show their full joy.</p>
<p><strong>32 ext. stone canyon - evening. 32</strong>: JOHN CLASKY
driving a smallish SUV. He is an upbeat, talented, successful man with
an ego as balanced as a high- end watch; who loves his wife, kids and
job. In other words, watch out, John.</p>
<p><strong>33 ext. clasky house - evening. 33</strong>: As John pulls
into the driveway next to a catering truck and exits his SUV carrying a
large wrapped tray..</p>
<p><strong>34 int. clasky house - evening. 34</strong>: As John moves
quickly through the downstairs, he puts the tray on a counter where food
servers are working.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I brought some dessert.</p>
<p><strong>caterer</strong>: She came down to check on the party and
realized the gardeners hadn’t finished rolling the sod.</p>
<p><strong>john’s pov - deborah and two female caterers.</strong>:
Deborah is wearing a party dress. They are rolling out the last huge
cylinder of sod, completing the now beautifully manicured backyard. It
is hard manual labor involving physical strength. The female caterers
are complaining that it’s too heavy but Deborah is undeterred.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: We can do it. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Why… do… I… care.. so.. much.. about….
CRAP?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Can you believe they left without
finishing?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Looks great, huh?…. You’re not looking.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was getting a kick looking at you look at
it.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I better get dressed again in case
anybody’s just a half hour late.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Okay..We’re okay here. Why can’t everything
be like sod? There’s no wait, no dung, nothing you have to do right and
yet it’s perfect. It covers up all your dirt and makes things
immediately pretty..then, the miracle, if you just give it time, it
roots and you can’t tell it from the real thing. No reaction. Nothing to
say.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Huh? Oh sure..I, uh..Well, no, I don’t have
anything particular to say.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh, John why don’t you just take out a
knife and kill me all together.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How’d you get there..Hey, wait a
minute..Deb..stop..come on. I’d like to figure this one out. What would
have been the great thing for me to say after you said the sod
sentence?..Really.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: That’s actually a good question.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There you go. I surprise sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I would have liked, if after I compared the
sod to life, if you had said, “Exactly!”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. But to say that and mean it I’d have to
think the same way you do.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: It’s worth a try…I had something else to
tell you…it’ll come to me..</p>
<p><strong>36 int. olive garden type restaurant - night 36</strong>:
Standing in a nicely decorated middle class restaurant, Cristina,
totally bilingual, speaks to the American hostess with a pronounced and
charming accent as her mother, standing beside her, bounces with energy
and joy.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Could we have a table for two, please?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: We’re celebrating.</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Smoking or non-smoking?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Dancing!</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Wow, expensive..</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: This is just for the starter?</p>
<p><strong>hostess</strong>: Uh-huh..And those men would like to buy you
a drink.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: This is very embarrassing but– “what’s
wrong with you? I’m with my daughter for God’s sake!”</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: And I would like to begin with the Jumbo
Shrimp.</p>
<p><strong>37 ext. stone canyon - day - 6:30 a.m. 37</strong>: Flor
smiling..enjoying the canyon..as she walks the mile plus from the bus
stop to work..one of a straggly line of domestics. Deborah jogs into
view.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Hi, Flor..See you up there.</p>
<p><strong>38 int. clasky house - upstairs - day 38</strong>: John
enters his son’s room..GEORGIE, age 9.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay…think SERIOUSLY about getting up. You
don’t have to get up yet but are you thinking seriously about it?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>39 int. clasky house - kitchen - day. 39</strong>: Bernice is
making French Toast, doing something novel with the filling and the last
cooking process. Some great idea which will have us making a mental note
to try it at home.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. clasky house - upstairs day - day 40</strong>: John
opens Georgie’s door again.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Now?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes..actual up..</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Morning, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, good morning.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: You as mad at me as Mom ’cause of what
happened?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, Georgie, I’m not.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Are you mad at me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Uh…okay, no..</p>
<p><strong>41 int. clasky house - kitchen doorway - day 41</strong>: As
Flor enters from outside.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Morning, good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Morning. Good too.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Try some.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Tough day.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I had an idea for a breakthrough in French
toast so I made breakfast. I don’t want to be teased about it.. No
sarcasm. No tough love. Just try it and if by any chance you have a
positive reaction…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Right..mean ol’ me. I can’t play right now.
I have to do something about your brother.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I had an idea for a recipe. When has that
happened? I got up early to do this. At least taste it, for God’s
sakes!</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh, it’s good…oh God, it’s rich – Oh God,
it’s good.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: By the way, you could do without this.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: NO..NO! FLOR!….Never do fetch.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I mean it, NEVER!</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I’m not mad. I’m thinking of you. This is
me being nice..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Just no taking ball from dog. Trust me on
that one.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You and me. We are fine. Just a tip.
Girlfriends. Could you make some coffee? Cafe?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>42 int. clasky house - upstairs - master bathroom - day
42</strong>: Deb in the shower…you have never seen so many shampoos,
conditioners and bath balms…never seen so huge a sponge..such fluffy
towels.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This isn’t an argument, honey.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Yes. Yes it is. So stop being so maniacally
calm.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No..it’s not. Because I understand your
side.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I can’t be wrong about that too. This is a
fight. We’re having a fight. Yo, I feel anger.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Can I have a moment?</p>
<p><strong>43 int. clasky house - master bedroom - day 43</strong>: As
John awaits his wife…a beat and she enters with two blue eyes. Even
though she is attempting reason and self-control her voice is filled
with tension and goes from loud to borderline yelling.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Okay..Let’s get someplace here.</p>
<p><strong>44 int. clasky house - kitchen - day 44</strong>: As Flor
works methodically - orienting herself..she is able to hear their
totally foreign words and though their volume registers on her a bit -
basically she remains blithe. Loading a dishwasher, memorizing where
everything is..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You, mister, are crazy making..I can’t take
this calm thing you’ve</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: started doing. It’s like this is your way
of letting me know there’s something deeply wrong with me because I’m
not calm.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let’s not go all over the place..Can’t we…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: If you’re going to talk to me please have
the decency to raise your voice.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: urgency and change of</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Just for a second.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We don’t have to be those people. Nobody’s
watching. They’ve been masquerading as us for a while here..I’ll
distract them - you make a break for it and I’ll meet you outside.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You’re ridiculing me because I care about
this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. I’m not. I mean this..let’s get away from
those two in case they’re as miserable as they look..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, baby.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Let me ask you a question..let me change
the subject..Forget for a moment that you won’t support me with
Georgie..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, I don’t think…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Here’s the question. It’s been on my mind
more and more. Do you do that calm thing for the purpose of infuriating
me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What? Why would … Why would anyone do
something to someone they love for the purpose of messing them up?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Deb, since high school we’ve been able to read
each other…take advantage of it..The answer to the question
is,“absolutely not.” Now take a look and tell me if you believe me.</p>
<p><strong>close on deborah’s eyes.</strong>: Studying, questioning,
probing, doubting, exhausted…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I don’t.. believe you. I think you just
want me to feel badly about myself..Sorry, honey.</p>
<p><strong>46 int. clasky house - kitchen - day 46</strong>: John enters
- not seeing Flor - goes to the Sparkletts water container and fills a
cup…He is shaken..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Great God in heaven save me.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Whoa…whoa…I didn’t know Deborah had found
someone… You work here? You’re going to help with the house and
kids?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Solo espa�ol.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You work here and you don’t speak any English
at all?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: All she has to do is dial 9-1-1 and press
two for Spanish. Flor…John. This is Flor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi, Flor.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look, I’ll take Georgie to school.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: No. I’m doing it..show Flor the ropes.</p>
<p><strong>47 ext. clasky house - driveway - day 47</strong>: The
biggest, baddest, BLACKEST SUV..there is some subtle custom work so the
vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite fathom. Deborah is wiping
away a tear as she gets in and shares a woman to woman moment with
Flor.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Fuckin’ hombres, huh?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: I just didn’t want to sing last night.</p>
<p><strong>deborah’s voice</strong>: Yeah. Well you said you would..You
said you wanted to. I asked you five times. Then when I have the whole
party paying attention you refused.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: It doesn’t do any good now, Georgie.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I’ve programmed it for Spanish.. Look, it
will take you anywhere and then back home. If you figured out how to
make coffee on that thing it’s all downhill.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: This is stop gap..You, kiddo, you’re going
to have to learn English.</p>
<p><strong>48 int. restaurant kitchen - late afternoon 48</strong>: John
cooking…the theory that nobody’s sexier than when they are seen doing
what they do best applies here.. In the BACKGROUND John’s number two,
PETER, the Sous Chef, being bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking
and GWEN, who spends most nights trying not to show her enormous
affection for John. At the moment, John’s work is a strange mixture of
art and cloddishness…..the hands blur with expertise…but he keeps
dropping items…..each time a Latin kitchen worker, ALEX, 20, dives on
the spillage..At one point they bump.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sorry…</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Not the best place to stand, fella.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. It’s me. You’re the new helper, huh..</p>
<p><strong>alex</strong>: I didn’t mean to…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No..no..it’s okay. It’s me being bugged.</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: You are going to be so happy..</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: I have something very important to tell
you.</p>
<p><strong>peg</strong>: Perfect cod this is John – John, perfect
cod..Best one I’ve seen all season and he was swimming twenty minutes
ago.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Knockout. You want to learn something? You
want to pack it away?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Cradle it…Put it in the cooler but not on its
side.. In the same position it swims. And check the ice pack..make sure
it can drain away..if it can’t the chlorine can hurt the flesh. Do all
that and nobody can put a fish in the fridge better than you…and that’s
a solid start.. First day and you already did something perfect.</p>
<p><strong>kid</strong>: Yes, I understand.</p>
<p><strong>maitre d’</strong>: Please. Now?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, sorry..I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Damn.. “ohhhh damn.”</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: What, buddy, what?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Victor spotted a food critic..</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: From?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: The New York Times..I’ll bet they sent her
out just for us. Here’s what she ordered.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Look, if you’re nervous take a walk..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t need a walk.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I’ll walk with you..I know a breathing
thing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you think I’m worried about… how I’ll
cook? That’s not the problem.. The lady wants fish. Get the fish.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I worked in a kitchen once in New York that
got four stars. It was like a line formed for the chance to become an
asshole. People’s accents changed. The heart went out of the place. You
understand.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>gwen</strong>: I agree with everything you’ve said. I admire
you for your feelings. I hope to adopt them as my own….</p>
<p><strong>on john.</strong>: As he works..Let’s be clear here…this is
that sequence that either kicks out or doesn’t..no food channel..no
simple knife stuff..something casually brilliant..meticulous…smart and
gifted as he prepares the critic’s meal.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know what to root for.. the thought of
one star makes me nauseous..but with four there’s no place to go but,
“Oh my God, they took away a star.” Three..three and a half. That’s what
you want..No. Wrong! Three and a half you feel disappointed that you
just missed out on four. You know what you want? Three and a quarter..
That would be perfect!! It would mean you’re good..but you’re not good
enough to feel disappointed that you just missed out on excellent..but
nothing truly bad happened, you still got your three and a quarter
stars. Which encourages you to try and improve..And you still get enough
respect so that you can get good people to work with you..Business is
good but not crazy. You’re right there underneath the radar where you
get to mind your own business. That’s a solid life.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Aw, man..this is amazing. No three and a
quarter here.</p>
<p><strong>49 int. clasky kitchen - day. 49</strong>: Evelyn, having a
glass of white wine and a sandwich, is talking to Bernice in the kitchen
also including Flor though she is only catching a word here or
there..</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Well, I’m in the vitamin section and this
little hip hop girl..what’s her name..Grammys - adorable – big
voice..subtle phrasing…oh, she’s famous..the kids know her…oh - little
blue shoes..darn me.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: God Bless the language barrier, it keeps you
from being bored with me.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Anyway, she said, “aren’t you Evelyn
Wright?” First of all, that she recognized me from the old covers and
then she …. Oh, please her name..it makes the story so much better…She
said, “Whenever I think everything is..” Pardon my French..pardon her
French “a mother hmmmhmmm…I put on one of your records..”</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Awwww. How sweet….</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Just such a lovely thing to come from the
blue….</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh, Mother…It’s not even noon.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: It’s almost two o’clock.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: God, where is this day going…Flor could you
come with me?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Grandma, tell Mom what happened.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. bernie’s room - late afternoon 50</strong>: John is
in Bernie’s room - helping her with her homework. They lay at right
angles to each other..He is testing her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is going to work.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I don’t know anything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Free your mind…the president whose policies
many consider responsible for the Great Depression…</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Name a vacuum cleaner..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Okay. Yes..thanks.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And this vacuum whooshed all this money out of
everyone’s pockets.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Got it. I no longer know nothing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: And Hoover was followed in office by..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I’m just drawing blanks. I’m embarrassed.
It’s my own fault I spent my time on math, which I’m lucky if I don’t
flunk anyway and..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: The guy we are looking for is not a ruse..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: What’s ruse mean?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Phony. So this president was not a ruse..He
was the real thing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ruse??</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Rusevelt..If I’d ever heard of the word
before - that would lock it in..It’s so stupid it might work anyway…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Surprise new clothes..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: What’d I do right?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Warehouse sale..</p>
<p><strong>on flor and john.</strong>: As they are COUPLED BY THE CAMERA
ANGLE as each catches on and is dumbfounded.</p>
<p><strong>on bernice..</strong>: Whose style, wit and grace should not
have to be used to deflect such trauma. But so be it, as, though
mightily stung:</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Thanks, mom..I’m glad you didn’t get here a
little earlier or else I wouldn’t be able to tell you that your gift is
a ruse. Please, excuse me..</p>
<p><strong>51 int. stairwell - early evening 51</strong>: Flor one step
behind John and Deborah who are moving quickly down the stairs…John
pissed..Deborah feeling the futility of anyone understanding her point
even as she makes it.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: She’s right between the two sizes..I
thought about it..what am I supposed to do encourage her…what is it? -
DENIAL? Or motivate her to get herself in shape.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Flor..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Me puedo ir?..go..can go?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Sure. Go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll drive you to the bus stop.</p>
<p><strong>52 ext. clasky house - driveway - day 52</strong>: As John
gets in his seat..then sees Flor approaching the door and hops out to
open her door…apologizing as he goes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sorry. I’m cracking.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Shiiiiiiit!</p>
<p><strong>53 int. john’s car - early evening.. 53</strong>: As they
drive down the canyon. He is wildly frustrated. Even if Flor were not
there, he would be talking to himself anyway, in the manner of bag
ladies and all of us.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I am running out of excuses for the lady of
the house.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But you know, you gotta watch out for the
times you think you’re absolutely right..But, man, Bernice has finals
tomorrow. She didn’t need this one..And just that look on her face when
she got the gifts– –like for a second she thought all her problems with
her mother had been solved…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: My mother did not understand her male
boss. His heart was good and he was rare in not flirting with her. But
they were starkly different. Privacy and dignity were the same word to
my mother. Naturally, when she found herself sitting next to a man who
cried over his child’s hurt she had no idea how to process the
event.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Gracias.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are you doing? Let me take you all the
way.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: How weird was this ride? Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No es nada.</p>
<p><strong>54 ext. bus stop - early evening.. 54</strong>: As Flor is
dropped off…the goodbye awkward.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The job was taxing her. She had no
template for confusion let alone frustration.</p>
<p><strong>55 int. flor’s apt. - evening 55</strong>: As Flor enters –
kisses her daughter..distraught and distracted. She walks immediately to
the refrigerator and takes out a chocolate cake and a bottle of milk…she
cuts a huge slice of cake and puts it in front of her startled
daughter..in Spanish riding her on being too thin..the daughter gestures
at her mother’s own slim figure.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: It was so unusual for my mother to ask my
help that I realized immediately she was losing her battle to be
uninvolved with the Claskys.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Try it on.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Please try it on?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Just try it on?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Just try it on.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Just try it on.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Just try it on…just try it on..</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Our culture embraces fullness in a woman.
You, the women of the admissions committee, as intelligent as you are,
have no idea how casual and complete such acceptance is back home, in
the land of the size 16 bikini.</p>
<p><strong>56 ext. bus stop - north valley - pre-dawn 56</strong>: Flor
is the only one waiting. An empty bus stops and she gets on.</p>
<p><strong>57 ext. street - near bus stop - high shot - first light
57</strong>: As we see Deborah cross Sunset Blvd., overtake and pass two
UCLA men running at a good clip as Flor’s bus stops.</p>
<p><strong>close on flor..</strong>: As she strides purposefully up the
street.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: This is one of the cultural differences
between us which I wish to explore academically at Princeton. American
women, I believe, actually feel the same as Hispanic women about
weight.</p>
<p><strong>58 int. clasky house - extreme early morning 58</strong>: The
house asleep. Flor walks carefully up the steps.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: ….a desire for the comfort of
fullness.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. bernie’s room - first light 59</strong>: Bernie
asleep on the bed…Kleenex abounds…the solid sleep earned by a few hours
of sobbing. She looks touchingly pretty and decidedly round. Flor looks
for, finds and carries out the new clothes Deborah had given her
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: And, when that desire is suppressed for
style and deprivation allowed to rule…</p>
<p><strong>angle on deborah &amp; killer hill:</strong>: Two young
athletic men and one woman considerably ahead of her on the steep
incline.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Left..left..</p>
<p><strong>on runners.</strong>: They turn and look confused at Deborah
who is so far behind them she has no need to pass..They turn away.
Deborah struggles to turn it on and does so…huffing to just behind them
where she utters one more strained:</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Left.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: …dieting, exercising American women become
afraid of everything associated with being curvaceous, such as
wantonness, lustfulness, sex, food, motherhood..all that is good in
life.</p>
<p><strong>61 int. clasky maid’s room - early morning. 61</strong>: Flor
at work on a sewing machine..opening seams, moving buttons, even
steaming where the buttons have been changed..etc.</p>
<p><strong>62 int. bernie’s room - morning 62</strong>: Flor is in the
room…having put the altered clothes back in place..Bernie’s alarm clock
rings..She wakes and sees Flor.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Hey..buenas dias, Flor..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Yes..Well, taste she has..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Just try it on.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Hey!!!! When did you learn to…</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Just try it on..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Too tight..it doesn’t fit.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Just try it on..Hey?!</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Just..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Okay. I’ll show you..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Lovely way to start the day. World’s most
trim Mexican learns her first sentence and uses it to watch me grrrrunt
my way into…</p>
<p><strong>into mirror.</strong>: To see Bernie in the foreground as
Flor looks on..nods approval and leaves.</p>
<p><strong>on bernie..</strong>: The fit of the clothes is as mystifying
as it is nice..she picks up another shirt..checks the size tag and then
studies it a bit.</p>
<p><strong>close up shirt..</strong>: As Bernie’s fingers find the
barely visible holes where the buttons have previously been.</p>
<p><strong>63 int. clasky house - kitchen - day 63</strong>: Flor at
work..Chum, ball in mouth, comes to her and nudges her.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Lo siento. No.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Hey..</p>
<p><strong>64 int. clasky house - day - fifteen minutes later
64</strong>: As John comes down the stairs..He looks apprehensive..From
the den comes the sound of singing..it stops him from going out the
front door as he turns to check it out.</p>
<p><strong>65 int. den - day.. 65</strong>: John finds Evelyn and
Georgie in their night clothes. They are singing an old song…something
like “LUSH LIFE” - something preposterous for a nine year-old boy..but
you can’t knock the quality of the voices..world class. They see him and
stop.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Every time he has a nightmare, I teach him
one of my old songs. That way the nightmares have a purpose.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: But I don’t have to sing it for anyone.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right. You’re clear on that..</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: How many did you sell of this song?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: He likes to know that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She was huge.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Seventy-six thousand..which is great for a
jazz album.</p>
<p><strong>66 ext. clasky house - day 66</strong>: As John, growing
tense, walks toward the front gate..Chum proffers a ball and accepts
defeat as he bends down to pick up the New York Times. John’s body
chemistry launches a surprise attack…anxiety and dread…He takes his
newspaper to a wire bench in the front driveway..He finds the
section..opens to the page..and just like that his life changes
forevermore.</p>
<p><strong>67 int. clasky house - day. 67</strong>: John enters..Georgie
is going up the stairs..Flor putting out breakfast food.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I am okay. Deborah around?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: She run.</p>
<p><strong>67a int. clasky house - upstairs - bernie’s room -
day</strong>: He looks in Bernie’s room. She is loading her backpack for
school..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, honey.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No..nothing…just that..</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: A kid offered me a trade..Let me show
you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Dad!!! He can wait.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No..It’s okay..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Let him wait..Yours is obviously
important.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: You don’t even know how important the trade
is..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let me just do Georgie…. Here.</p>
<p><strong>68 int. clasky house - georgie’s room 68</strong>: We MOVE
with John and Georgie to Georgie’s room where he goes to his
collectibles..He holds up a card..</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: He says he’ll give me any three silvers for
him.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know…This is the one you started
with..You really want to give up your first card?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: I know..that’s why I needed you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: ..this is your favorite..</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: I think he’d go higher.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: But it’s not numbers..it’s…..</p>
<p><strong>69 int. kitchen - day 69</strong>: Flor and Evelyn
jolted..they exit to follow the sound..</p>
<p><strong>70 int. bernie’s room - day 70</strong>: As they enter
holding the paper. She has been smacked in the heart by gleeful and
prideful emotions…It is disorienting for her to experience the rush of
pleasure.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: For God’s sake..why did you…</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: WHY?!!? CRAZY FATHER, WHY?!? Why aren’t YOU
screaming?..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m getting there..just the stunned thing has
to get dealt with…</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: John Clasky, who at 25 made his mark on the
New York restaurant scene when JAMMED lived up to and survived its silly
name, has re- emerged as a young and confident veteran taking chances
with his combinations in so subtle a manner..”</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: If he gave me six…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Wait a minute, your sister’s talking.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: “…beginning with the succession of
appetizers, each one with its own stunning and fully realized agenda, is
constantly yet casually daring.” Ah, Dad…this is so great… Now here’s
the thing…</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: “Eating at this perfect smaller, passionate
restaurant inspires one’s own abandonment of caution. To wit: John
Clasky is the best chef in the United States.”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look how great you read it.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Perfect, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: John..John…Oh, my God you even look
different to me….</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I wonder what mom will do?</p>
<p><strong>71 int. bedroom - late afternoon 71</strong>: Deborah is
ripping John’s clothes off..buttons fly..shreds of cloth..John is
laughing - happy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oooohhch!</p>
<p><strong>72 ext. north valley - day. 72</strong>: Flor walks to the
news stand - as if to buy something – changes her mind and LEAVES THE
FRAME only to RETURN A HALF- BEAT LATER where she reads to the dealer
from a note.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: New York Times..</p>
<p><strong>73 int. flor’s apt. - night… 73</strong>: Cristina, standing,
translating the review into Spanish for her mother…as she comes to the
last sentence.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Wow…“John Clasky es el mejor chef en Los
Estados Unidos..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Ah, bravo…</p>
<p><strong>74 int. clasky master bedroom - day. 74</strong>: The Claskys
are engaged in sex. John’s brief sounds are exuberant..they shift
position so that Deborah is on top BRINGING DEBORAH INTO A CLOSE SINGLE.
Suddenly her smile fades - she hits the skids.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh, damn it — what am I going to do?
Everything seems so surely pointless…</p>
<p><strong>on john.</strong>: This IS WEIRD. And then the small,
distinctive sound of Deb’s climax…then, in a relatively small voice.</p>
<p><strong>deborah’s voice</strong>: Okay here…okay there…good, good,
good.</p>
<p><strong>on john.</strong>: Puzzling over what just happened..a few
false starts forming his thought…then finally..hesitantly…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, Deb?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You know, I guess I got used to you getting a
little blue after intercourse…But DURING..??</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Something else I do wrong.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’ve gotta stop walking away.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: If I stay, I will say awful things to you
that I might not even mean..You pick.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: See ya.</p>
<p><strong>75 int. john’s car - day. 75</strong>: Very upset as he
drives. Then comes to the red light at the end of the street and sees
Flor walking with others. An awkward beat as he waits for the light to
change and they acknowledge each other..the light remains red..she
confers with another woman.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Yo le� la cr�tica buena.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I read your good review.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: It’s nice.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Not so far…How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I do fine.</p>
<p><strong>76 int. restaurant - day 76</strong>: As he enters….the phone
is going off the hook..As he passes the maitre d’s desk. Their
conversation is strangely hushed and very, very quick.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Should I stop answering? We’re booked for
two months solid.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, no, no, no, no….I want to keep some
walk-in business..I want this to stay neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Impossible. There would be riots..You should
hear the desperation in their voices..Best day of my life.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: We’ll serve a full menu at the bar then.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Then where do I put the people waiting for a
table? It won’t work.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do this for me.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: There’s no way.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Do this for me or I’ll set my hair on fire and
start punching myself in the face.</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah..you’re right…that was an unusual way for
me to make myself understood..But you’ll do the bar thing?</p>
<p><strong>victor</strong>: Yes, of course, John..</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ah, man..Okay.</p>
<p><strong>78 int. restaurant - cooling room - day 78</strong>: Again
there is a kind of strange rapidity to the conversation sparked by
John..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s up? What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ve gotten a fantastic offer for my own
place..Everybody wants to back me since the paper came out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s your reaction?</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: Honestly? Because I’ve had this very unusual
reaction.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>peter</strong>: I’ve had a hard on almost all day and it
won’t go away. Like I’m riding on the back seat of a bus with bad shocks
and every other passenger is a gorgeous woman with a yellow sports top
whose leaning over. It’s like every dream I ever had and some even I
didn’t have the balls to dream..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So you’re considering taking it?… Okay, here’s
the thing. I can’t lose you and still keep the hours I’m keeping. I
can’t do my life unless I can hold onto you. I think I just gave you an
incredible bargaining position.</p>
<p><strong>79 int. clasky bedroom - night 79</strong>: As John and
Deborah lay next to each other.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: So you gave away twenty percent of the
restaurant without talking to me about it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah. If I didn’t do it - I’d have been coming
home just to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Remember the other day when you asked me
the perfect response to something I said?…I’m asking you now..what would
you like my response to be to your giving away twenty percent of the
business without asking me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: “You’re ma man!”</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Okay! So that would be???</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My dream response from you, yes.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I’m not quite there..Actually, I just had
this flash that the reason women in the old days used to faint was to
avoid doing acts of violence against men. And I was all worried about
figuring out the timing just to talk to you about renting a place for
the summer.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, I think you got your timing.</p>
<p><strong>80 ext. clasky house - day 80</strong>: A man is parked at
the gate in an open convertible..He is great looking…We HEAR Deborah’s
excited voice over the gate speaker…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Be right out…</p>
<p><strong>81 ext. clasky driveway - day.. 81</strong>: As Deborah calls
behind her as she opens the door…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Mom, you want to come?..the realtor’s
here..Okay, see you later.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: I’m Mike..there’s one great rental that
just came on..so we’re starting at the top..</p>
<p><strong>82 ext. convertible - day.. 82</strong>: Deborah’s hair whips
across her face…it’s bothersome.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I’ll never be one of those girls whose hair
blows perfectly in a convertible.</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: Move your seat forward..</p>
<p><strong>realtor</strong>: A little more..just..good.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh, you must be trouble.</p>
<p><strong>83 ext. clasky rented beach house - day. 83</strong>: As they
move toward the house…seeing the beach beyond.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Gorgeous, huh..Pretty, fabulous, beautiful.
What word is the same in Spanish?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Fabuloso.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. clasky rented beach house - day. 84</strong>: As
Deborah, Flor and Evelyn enter. They carry boxes of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I don’t care if it’s a rental..this place
is getting a fixing.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: This will be yours..</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Did you ask her if she could live in?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Come on…there’s no buses from her to here.
There’s no question. Double come on…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: The Barrio - Carbon Beach..The Barrio -
Carbon Beach. What to do? Don’t worry. I’m putting nicer stuff in here
too.</p>
<p><strong>85 ext. clasky - beach rental - day 85</strong>: As they move
through a little courtyard area toward the street.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You must learn English. Why won’t she learn
English? I’m going to have to learn, “you must learn English,” in
Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I think Flor is perfect and we should do all
we can to keep her from changing.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Gee, you took the words right out of my
mouthay.</p>
<p><strong>86 ext. pch - day 86</strong>: As she leads Flor along the
highway side of Carbon Beach - passing houses until she sees a Hispanic
man washing someone’s car in a driveway. Evelyn is many steps back.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh, good. Do you speak English?</p>
<p><strong>hispanic man</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Would you translate for me?</p>
<p><strong>hispanic man</strong>: Sure…forever.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Wait till I say something before you start
in.. I rented a house here for the summer and now she must sleep at the
house because of the bus schedule.</p>
<p><strong>on flor.</strong>: Stricken. She turns to Deborah.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No.. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>hispanic man</strong>: She can’t because of her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You have a daughter? You have a whole
daughter you haven’t mentioned..How old?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Twelve.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: It’s a little crazy that I don’t know
that.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Don’t translate asides.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>hispanic man</strong>: She can’t live here. Her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Okay.. Her daughter can also live with us
for the summer..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>hispanic man</strong>: I don’t know. She just doesn’t want
to.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Will you please just tell me what she
said.</p>
<p><strong>hispanic man</strong>: She said, “I just don’t want to.”</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: If she didn’t tell us about her child she
has to have a deep sense of privacy. We can figure out how she can still
live at home. Hell, I don’t mind driving her at night.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Let’s spare the world you on the roads.
Well, what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I’m sorry, my friend, this is what I need.
It’s just for the summer. I don’t want to lose you. But ….</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Yo vivo aqu�.</p>
<p><strong>hispanic man</strong>: She’ll live here.</p>
<p><strong>hispanic man</strong>: I said, “God protect you from that
boss.”</p>
<p><strong>87 ext. flor’s apt. complex - day 87</strong>: As Cristina,
trying to suppress her grin, skips quickly down the stairs moving
towards a truck from John’s restaurant. Flor follows tight lipped -
resolved. They each carry many clothes on wire hangers. A group of girls
on the balcony literally cheer Cristina on.</p>
<p><strong>mal—–i——bu!</strong>: Cristina grins hugely back at them.</p>
<p><strong>88 int. malibu tunnel - day 88</strong>: The two women in the
truck and then..</p>
<p><strong>89 int. truck - day. 89</strong>: As the truck leaves the
tunnel and all is cliffs, sand, and waves..Cristina taking it in,
unaware that her mother’s eyes never leave her.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The first time one sees natural beauty
which is owned by others confounds the senses.. I had never imagined the
word “money” could be associated with anything but the anxiety of not
having enough. I didn’t know God had a toy store for the rich.</p>
<p><strong>90 ext. clasky beach house - street side - day 90</strong>:
The truck in the driveway..the women walking through a front door into a
court yard.</p>
<p><strong>91 ext. clasky beach house - beach side - day 91</strong>:
Georgie, in a swim suit, talking to CHUM in the manner of people trying
to excite dogs.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Who wants to go swimming?..Yes, who wants
to go swimming?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Who wants to go swimming?..Huh..</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Not now..But I promise I’ll go in the summer
after next.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want to go swimming?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Oh yeah, you’re off.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you think, wet suits?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Wet suits are for wimps..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, you’re right..let me get mine..</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: You’re good.</p>
<p><strong>92 int./ext. hallway / patio - day 92</strong>: Behind Flor
and Cristina as they move toward the Claskys and their destiny….Flor
behind her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>reverse - close on cristina.</strong>: As her eyes pop on
seeing the Clasky beach house.</p>
<p><strong>very close on deborah</strong>: As her eyes pop on seeing the
stunning twelve year-old enter her home, haloed by the sun. Again, Flor
less distinct in the background. Bernice, just outside the open patio
door, is putting on a shirt over her bathing suit as she looks at
Cristina and emits a small, prescient moan.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Look at this child..Flor, you could make a
fortune at surrogate pregnancy….</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Que?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi. I’m John..It’s good to see you.
Great..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Hi. This is my daughter, Bernice..I’m
Deborah..And out there…are Georgie and.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I’m so glad to meet you. I’m a fan of your
mother’s.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: I’m Cristina.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: No comparisons, please, no comparisons.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: My mother says it’s best if we get out of
the way and put our things away.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Have you ever been to the beach here?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: I’ve never been anyplace but Mexico and
Texas…..before today.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here’s the most important place in the
house..grab this stuff whenever you want.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Thank you..thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Very little accent?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Que?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Sin acento.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Thank you..there’s an A.P. total fluency
class where they work you pretty hard at sounding American.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Cristina..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Right. Settle in..</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Thank you. I am thrilled to be here.</p>
<p><strong>93 int. maid’s room - afternoon 93</strong>: Deborah has
re-decorated the room with casual brilliance…Flor is
tense..distraught…her daughter giddy…excited over the sheets, the tv,
the pile of towels..a chaise..She goes to work on her mother to go
swimming….wanting her to appreciate the fun element of being here…the
spirit of the kid such that Flor relents….</p>
<p><strong>94 ext. beach - evening 94</strong>: Flor and Cristina, two
sea nymphs, lit by the floodlights from the beach homes.</p>
<p><strong>other angle.</strong>: John and Georgie in the waves..body
surfing…they get to shore…John sees the two females..dashing in the
water in their bathing suits..He remains hidden in a very shallow wave
as they run in…then once they are in he starts taking off his wet suit
hurriedly…</p>
<p><strong>on john..</strong>: As he suffers the cold – Georgie enjoying
every moment.</p>
<p><strong>95 ext. clasky beach rental - dawn’s early light 95</strong>:
Wave lights still shining..On a dune sits Cristina, looking out.</p>
<p><strong>96 int. master bedroom 96</strong>: As Deborah steps out on
the deck and sees Cristina.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Hey, Cristina…hey…hey..What are you doing
up?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Oh, hi..so beautiful..I was just
excited.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I know..Would you believe I had to talk my
husband into this? Would you believe I had to talk my husband into
it?…do you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Yes…I just .. I didn’t know what to
say?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Do you want to come with me? – I’m going to
the flea market.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: I don’t know what that…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: It’s the Rose Bowl… miles, actual miles, of
great things for sale for God’s sake…We can have brunch in Pasadena.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: I don’t want to wake my mother so
early.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I’ll leave her a note…I’ll</p>
<p><strong>97 int. flor’s room - morning - two hours later 97</strong>:
As Flor wakes..looks around.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Cristina?</p>
<p><strong>insert..the note</strong>: Dear Flor,</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: With great energy born of bottled fury,
Flor begins to go through her daughter’s things…finding her backpack and
extracting a Spanish/English dictionary.</p>
<p><strong>insert dictionary.</strong>: As her finger points to:
“Steal…robar” And then she flips some pages feverishly..Her finger
indicating: “daughter …. hija”</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Stop thanking me. I love having the
company.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: It was an adventure which I’ll
remember.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Your English is genius. Do you dream in
Spanish or English?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Just recently I’ve had a dream in
English.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What was it?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: I am so sorry. I – uh..I’d ..I uh, can’t
tell ..This is so uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You could have just said you didn’t
remember.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: I, uh, guess so..but I do.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Look who’s sensational.</p>
<p><strong>99 ext. clasky rented beach house - day. 99</strong>: Evelyn
is sitting on the patio making sangria..Flor enters. She is pissed.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: She’s wild-eyed over this..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Aw, shit.. Sorry about the word,
Georgie.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: You want to know what happened?</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: No thank you.</p>
<p><strong>100 int. living room - day 100</strong>: John enters..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, Flor..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sorry..very sorry..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: They should be back soon..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, Flor..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Deborah made a mistake. I understand how you
feel…Do you understand me at all, generally? Is simp�tico the word?</p>
<p><strong>close on flor..</strong>: Is he coming on?..</p>
<p><strong>her pov..</strong>: His kind eyes.</p>
<p><strong>full shot..</strong>: This is real eye contact..two vaguely
humiliated people finding real company for an instant. Without thought,
she duplicates his gesture and pats his back.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Simp�tico, yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Un momento, huh?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m really sorry this is happening. I just
want you to know that. I am real sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I didn’t mean..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I meant..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, the good thing about being an idiot is
that every once in a while you cheer people up..Got to get to work.</p>
<p><strong>camera stays with flor</strong>: As he exits…thinks about
John’s demeanor, smiles again, shakes it off as her mind fills with
concern for Cristina.</p>
<p><strong>101 ext. clasky rented beach house - sunset. 101</strong>:
Deborah’s SUV loaded at the curb..She and Cristina begin to carry things
in…</p>
<p><strong>102 int. clasky rented beach house - day 102</strong>:
Evelyn, Bernie and Flor are gathered in the living room. All staring at
her.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What? Something bad happen?</p>
<p><strong>on cristina..</strong>: Enormously anxious on reading her
mother’s mood.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Cristina, tell your mother I just played
around with your hair..she can put it back..no hurt feelings.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Not right now.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What? –</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You can’t just take someone else’s…..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Nuh-uh, Mom..don’t go there..or I’ll go
there and you know where “there” is.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Can you believe what Flor is making this
into..Shoot me if I ever get that hard to deal with.</p>
<p><strong>103 int. flor’s room - evening 103</strong>: MUSIC IN:
Action, purpose, energy.. Flor is dictating in Spanish as Cristina
writes it down in English on a pad. Cristina enormously
uncomfortable.</p>
<p><strong>insert - the pad.</strong>: The pad, in effect, lends
subtitles to Flor’s words. Cristina winces with the words she records
even while punctuating perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>pad writing</strong>: You cannot take my child without my
permission..And, if you had asked me I would not have given permission.
Is this why you did not ask? Because you knew this. You have no rights
over my private life.</p>
<p><strong>on flor..</strong>: Reaching a decisive conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>pad</strong>: If you have any disagreement with this, I no
longer wish to work here.</p>
<p><strong>on cristina’s look</strong>: This is awful news.</p>
<p><strong>on flor.</strong>: For a decisive nod of affirmation. She
adjusts her daughter’s hair to the way it was, takes the note and
exits.</p>
<p><strong>104 int. clasky rented beach house - living room - day
104</strong>: Flor enters in something of a fury and holds the letter
out to Deborah, who hates being cornered in this manner. She actually
places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What’s this?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: For you.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: From?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You are not yourself…This was written in
anger. You sleep on it and then if you still want me to have it –
fine..I don’t think you will once calm and rational thought returns.
Just sleep on it.</p>
<p><strong>105 int. clasky rented beach house - bedroom - morning
105</strong>: Deborah surreptitiously finishing putting on her running
clothes and is making for the door when the alarm clock goes off and
John awakens.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She didn’t even want us to know she had a
daughter - then, on the first day, you take the kid without asking. I
think that’s…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What!?! Insensitive? Elitist?
Irresponsible? Perverse? Dizzy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Dumb.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: When is anyone in this damn house or this
damn life going to consider my feelings? I just tried to make a lovely
kid feel welcome. There’s no reason to rake it over…I let it go..and
gave Flor the room to let it go. Which I’m sure she has! It’s over!! So
get on board.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I slept.</p>
<p><strong>106 int. clasky beach rental - den - day 106</strong>:
Deborah stands over Cristina, who is writing in Spanish a note Deborah
is dictating. As John passes through the room.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I am deeply and sincerely sorry to have
upset you. Especially in light of the deep connection, as women, I
believe us to have.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: And to think I was worried about Flor living
here with her kid?</p>
<p><strong>107 ext. clasky beach rental - patio 107</strong>: John is
talking to all three kids in an effort to lift the overall atmosphere.
IN THE BACKGROUND we see Deborah handing Flor her letter..Cristina
taking sidelong glances…relieved to see them shake hands , hug .</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So here’s the idea..I want to make a serving
platter for serving fish using sea glass like this..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I used to hunt for this stuff every free
minute when I apprenticed in Italy. This is bits of broken glass that
the ocean sand blasts over the years..great looking, huh? So you guys go
hunting and I’ll pay 50 cents for any piece, a dollar for anything as
big as this and five dollars for any color that isn’t brown, clear or
green.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Do we have to do this?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Oh, come on…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Come on, Cristina - go get em.</p>
<p><strong>108 ext. beach - day - various shots 108</strong>: The kids
combing through pebbles. Georgie becoming bored and stopping.. Bernie
stopping.</p>
<p><strong>109 ext. beach - same scene - sunset.. 109</strong>: Lots of
people on their decks..hot-tubbing, sunning, partying..rich people
forming New Yorker cartoons in the background as Cristina continues to
doggedly collect her sea glass. At one point, she comes upon a teenage
couple making out near a mass of pebbles, and politely asks them to roll
over so she can search the area.</p>
<p><strong>110 int. flor’s room - pre-dawn 110</strong>: Cristina
arising..</p>
<p><strong>111 ext. beach - pre-dawn.. 111</strong>: Cristina collecting
sea glass.</p>
<p><strong>112 ext. beach - same scene - night. 112</strong>:
Illuminated by the surf lights of the beach homes, Cristina plugs
away.</p>
<p><strong>113 ext. clasky’s rented beach house - late afternoon.
113</strong>: John exits his door and steps to his car..as he is about
to get in..</p>
<p><strong>cristina’s voice</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hi..what’s doing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m broke.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: No..you don’t have to pay..I’m sorry.
Don’t worry, please.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. I’m kidding..Instead of a platter – I’ll
just build a sea glass building and serve fish inside… Great,
Cristina..Why don’t you count it and..</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: I have… Many times..I didn’t sleep. I
counted.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So what’s the damage…total?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: It depends on whether you consider these
four a color other than green, brown or clear..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, this one is borderline.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: I agree.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh my God, you found a blue..Nobody finds a
blue..You know how a blue happens? I mean, before the ocean blasts it
for 30-40 years. Somebody had to throw away an old Milk of Magnesia
bottle. You know what Milk of Magnesia is?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So how much for the whole deal?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Eleven hundred and one dollar.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. We’ll finish dealing with it when I get
home from work.</p>
<p><strong>114 int. flor’s room - one a.m. 114</strong>: Flor asleep –
Cristina awake, alert..footsteps. She hears John enter. She moves slowly
so as not to awaken Flor.</p>
<p><strong>115 int. hallway - one a.m. 115</strong>: As she enters from
the back room and sees that John is walking into the kitchen. Her eye
goes to the hall table on which there sits a fat envelope with her name
on it.</p>
<p><strong>116 int. clasky bedroom - one a.m. 116</strong>: John enters
the bedroom to find a note from Deb that she will be late. He is
disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>117 int. flor’s room - night - on cristina 117</strong>: Not
aware of being observed..opens the envelope and takes out a thick wad of
cash..almost swoons..as she goes about hiding it..she is jolted by her
mother’s whispered incredulity…</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Cristina..</p>
<p><strong>118 int. pocket kitchen - late night 118</strong>: The best
chef in America has just fixed himself a snack as a salve to his
spirits. It’s a little like Dagwood Bumstead as a culinary genius..This
is a snack we will remember and copy…John is approaching a perfect
moment…and this is a guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the
fullest…</p>
<p><strong>119 int. clasky house - living room 119</strong>: He carries
the brilliant snack to the living room and is just about to take his
first bite when he hears emotional Spanish voices approaching. He looks
up.</p>
<p><strong>angle on flor and cristina</strong>: As they enter. Cristina
translating her mother’s words.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: My mother wishes me to represent exactly
what she says, nothing else.</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: May I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You mean your mother….</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure you can talk to me..</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: I don’t have to sleep first?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: Did you give this money to my
daughter?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I made this little deal..with all the kids
to…</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: Please..</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: You don’t tell or ask the mother
when you give a child a fortune for looking on the beach for
stones..what is the word for this..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sea glass?</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: No..not a name for the stones..a
name for the act..what you did..</p>
<p><strong>on flor..</strong>: As she spits out the word to her
daughter.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Engre�do.</p>
<p><strong>on john..</strong>: As his eyes shift to Cristina fearing the
word he will hear.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, no..engre�do’s going to be rough.</p>
<p><strong>on cristina..</strong>: Reluctantly taking the emotional
stance of her mother to deliver the word.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: It’s hard to translate.</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: Smug.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I had no idea it would amount to that kind of
money..I thought — sort of tops fifty dollars.</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: Fifty dollars is a lot of
money..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay. Right.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ah, shit..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sorry….I get why you are upset. It might
not look it but I am good at getting things. Doing something about it is
something else..I was going to talk to you before I actually gave her
the money..but maybe I should have checked before I started the whole
thing. I know what it’s like when you feel your kid is being messed
with..I get the message. It won’t happen again. It’s late..I’m sure we’d
all like…</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: To what..sleep? If this was small
enough to be helped by some little apology, I would be a fool to bring
it up..I need to say more no matter what the result. I need to be
impolite. You leave someone else’s child alone. It’s simple, no? It is
too easy for children to feel contradictions..It encourages questioning
their parents..and that makes them less safe. Your wife takes her for
rides and changes her hair..You give her money. Here.. Take back the
money????????????</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: I did not mean to be angry to you
- only emotional..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What about hypocritical?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah, you heard me. It’s not like you didn’t
do the same thing…</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, yes. So go lecture yourself..you won’t
need a translator for that one…I mean what am I lately… A recycling
bin?..just anyone dump in your garbage and hope I make something useful
out of it…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, you did the same thing…you think I didn’t
know about altering those outfits for Bernie..She tells me her
stuff….So, am I missing something? Is there a real difference between
that and what you are complaining about?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Sin diferencia. Yo interfer�.</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: No difference. I interfered.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay……I’m still not sure I did the right thing
keeping it to myself. It felt disloyal to Deborah..but my daughter
really needed someone to be kind to her right then..so..so.</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: I am very embarrassed. You are
very right. Hypocrisy..yes.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll tell you, it’s pretty wild to say
something and have the other person just concede the point. I’m dazed
here.</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: I will leave whenever it is good
for you and…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No..no..come on, man..</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: But how can I work for you after
we talk like this?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You can’t quit even if you want to and you
know why.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes, you do..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because then Cristina will blame herself for
costing you the job…and that guilt…I don’t know if you know about
guilt..</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Culpa, guilt, s�. We know. We are
Catholics.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Culpa, si..Por Dios, Si.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: We know.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: We know.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, welcome back.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Good night, Mr. Clasky..</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Good night As they exit..their backs to
John, daughter following mother…Flor speaks to her daughter.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No te puedo tener haciendo esto por mi. Ahora
tengo que aprender ingl�s.</p>
<p><strong>cristina as flor</strong>: I can’t have you doing this for
me. I must learn English now.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No, dije eso por ti - no por John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You have a wonderful mother.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Que?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Nada.</p>
<p><strong>120 int. flor’s room - night 120</strong>: A Spanish
commercial for learning English in a hurry is on television..Flor on the
phone ordering it..</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Learning English would cost five hundred
and ninety nine dollars down and 15 monthly payments of one hundred and
ten dollars…which represents 48 percent interest..Mexicans marketing
Mexicans. But not a penny was wasted.</p>
<p><strong>121 ext. mail box - day 121</strong>: As Flor takes a package
from the box.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: My mother showed an extraordinary facility
for learning the language.</p>
<p><strong>122 int. beach house - laundry room - day 122</strong>: Flor
listening to the tapes as she does laundry.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: ..as well as a totally committed,
obsessive work ethic, which blocked out all else..She was her daughter’s
mother.</p>
<p><strong>123 ext. beach - late at night 123</strong>: Flor sitting on
the sand…listening to her tapes..continually forced by Chum’s obsessive
persistence to throw him the ball.</p>
<p><strong>124 ext. beach house - late night 124</strong>: As John
arrives…He bumps the walls on entering.</p>
<p><strong>125 int. beach house - late night 125</strong>: As John
enters the house, clearly drunk. There is the sound of skittering paws
as CHUM approaches.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, boy, I can use some up company.</p>
<p><strong>126 int. beach house - den - late night 126</strong>: As John
enters the room to find CHUM proffering the ball to Flor who is watching
one of video language tapes. She tosses the ball without a look or a
thought..then starts when she sees John standing there. He cheers,
seeing her predicament.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You gotta do something about Chum..Your arm’s
going to go.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Don’t you sleep anymore?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No..You get more if you keep at it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re doing fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Now I am like a three year-old. Your wife go
out.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: She say where?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Listen..I just forgot she was going out..don’t
be a smart ass. Uh-oh..well, you and I communicate mostly in apologies
anyway..I’m sorry. I should be whipped. I should be stoned- it’s been a
while - I meant to say, I think, don’t be smart, don’t be kind, don’t be
sensitive, don’t be beautiful. I meant to say, “hi, Flor, good night
Flor..that show you’re watching is going to be a hit.”</p>
<p><strong>127 ext. p.c.h. - la salsa fast food place - day.
127</strong>: Cristina and Bernice waiting in line at the Mexican fast
food place on P.C.H. with the towering signature Mexican male figure on
its roof. Deborah is parked curbside in the SUV.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: How’d you get your mother to let you go
with my mother?</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Well, your mother just said she could use
my help on a few errands while you’re in class…</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: No. Just that I hate summer school.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Why do you go then?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I’m not sure I can explain to you the
concept of not doing well in a class..in this case math…and the system
kind of insists on the illusion that you’ve learned math – so they make
you go to summer school..It helps them avoid facing that they have
failed in their mission.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: What do you mean they failed?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Joking.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Oh. I see. Forgive me, I don’t have a real
sense of humor.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Thank you, God. Joking…</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: The joke is?</p>
<p><strong>128 int. suv - day. 128</strong>: As they get in..Deborah
privy to the conversation now.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: That you’re better at everything than I
am…and I was thanking God for there being this one thing where I might
have my nose in front.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: And that thing is???</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Sexual experience..</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: That one even she knows is funny.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Look at you girls.</p>
<p><strong>129 int. beach bedroom - day 129</strong>: Deb working an
outfit..her mother eyeing her..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Cristina’s already read, on her own,
everything on Bernice’s summer reading list..And she’s two grades
behind..Imagine if she went to Bernice’s school..And they’d kill to give
her a scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Talk to Flor…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Yeah..she’s so open to new things.</p>
<p><strong>130 ext. gorgeous private school -day. 130</strong>: Deborah
and Cristina standing in a grass bordered parking lot…Deborah, feigning
upset, tearing into her bag but her focus is elsewhere as she
periodically looks off. She is clearly stalling.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Can’t find my keys..</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Deborah…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Hi, Arlene.. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Hi. This is Cristina..the girl I’m always
raving about..This is Arlene Folsom..the school director.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Hi..</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Hello..a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Folsom.
I couldn’t believe how beautiful the grounds were as we drove in. I just
think the balance of the buildings to open ground is so wonderful and
must have been very difficult to achieve.</p>
<p><strong>arlene</strong>: Would you like a little tour?</p>
<p><strong>moving camera..</strong>: First showing Cristina in
foreground and her POV of this Drop Dead Gorgeous Rich Kids School in
the background and then we MOVE CLOSER ON CRISTINA. We see lust in her
reaction.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The experience was literally mind
boggling. My mind did boggle. My cranial cells stunned. Even if I had
enough sense of wonder to imagine such a school existed; my sense of
fairness made it unthinkable that any school could offer this much more
than my own..</p>
<p><strong>131 int. beach living room - day 131</strong>: This is the
last day of the summer rental - many packed cartons on the floor.
Deborah, Flor and Cristina engaged in a momentous conversation.. quite
beside the point, we see Flor periodically make the motion of throwing
the ball. But we do not cut to Chum, rather we just hear his claws
skittering after the ball as we</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Nuh-uh, Flor you are not pinning this one
on me. I’ve got to finish packing up.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I just don’t….Out of space this school wants
her to go for free?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: We ran into the school head. They want
diversity…Cristina knocked her out…I had nothing to do with it. By the
way, the scholarship is worth twenty thousand dollars. And early
registration is tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: It is too far from our home.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You could move in with us in town.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Never, thank you…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Okay, then don’t..By the way..the phrase is
“NO, thank you.”</p>
<p><strong>132 int. flor’s room - night 132</strong>: Flor has her
earphones on listening to her English tapes..but she is enormously upset
as she watches her daughter passionately pray in English..soon taking
off the ear phones.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Please, dear God..Enter my mother’s heart
and make her understand what this school would mean.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Alright. I look.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Amen.</p>
<p><strong>133 ext. l.a. public school - flor at cristina’s school - day
133</strong>: Summer session - L.A. public school..ninety percent
Hispanic. Through Flor’s POV, the place is seen not as crowded and worn
but as vibrant with community.</p>
<p><strong>134 ext. private school - flor at bernice’s school - day
134</strong>: Highly anxious and out of place, she sees the upper-scale
students..five percent Latino…No brochure can do it justice. Overwhelmed
by the implications, Flor’s eyes tear.</p>
<p><strong>135 int. flor’s room - late night 135</strong>: Cristina
sleeps. Flor sits on her bed - no thought of sleep.</p>
<p><strong>136 int. beach house - late night 136</strong>: John enters,
home from work … as he passes Flor’s door it opens and she steps out.
Before she can continue on, she sees Evelyn at the foot of the stairs,
carrying a glass of port.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Hi, Flor, want some port?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No, thank you, Evelyn.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Thanks for never judging me..Love you. Love
everybody. That’s what’s killing me.. Sleep well.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn’s pov.</strong>: She sees Flor approach John. Evelyn
looks thoughtful.</p>
<p><strong>137 int. den - late night 137</strong>: John is about to pour
himself a stiff drink. Flor startles him.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: May I talk with you?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Me? Deborah will be home soon. I just talked
to her.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I need real talk..Is it okay?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Outside? Private?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Sure….. You have me a little worried…</p>
<p><strong>138 ext. beach - night 138</strong>: He sits..she stands,
gorgeous..The wind gusts periodically blowing her dress against her
body. He tries not to notice.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: You know about Cristina and your great
school?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, it’s happened. Is it driving you nuts?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Yes, nuts. I have no idea what to do. Such an
important thing.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: It’s a good school?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tops. It’s tops.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: So you like it?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. I hate the damn school. But that’s because
they keep sending my daughter home anxiety-ridden, mostly over
geometry..I mean you “get” Bernice..In a decent world her school should
let her know how great she is, right?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Very right.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So, don’t ask me..I’m worried about my own kid
there.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: You don’t have to worry about Bernice. Nothing
is going to change that heart.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Um…..yeah..thanks… It’s great to hear someone
else say that out loud..Hard to explain.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I “get” it.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ah, man..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: It will be okay.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No, I was thinking about you..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Your, “Ah, man” was for me? You think I am in
trouble with Cristina?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s just tough to be sane.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: ….I never know a man who can put himself in my
place like you do. How do you become that man?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know…You introduce two Jews in the
desert and wait five thousand years. Then, bingo, somebody else who can
see trouble coming but can’t do anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I want to.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing. I don’t know what I’m talking
about..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Will you sit down.. Get out of the damn
wind.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: So you going to send her?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I don’t know. But it does not feel good. I
think if she goes there it will be one of two things..either she will be
odd…or she will make herself the same as them.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: That is EXACTLY the way I felt about Bernice
going there..Exactly.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Yes, you gotta.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This was a crummy summer.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Not all crummy.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Thank you, good night. I go sleep.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good night..Hey?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You speaking English…It’s, uh..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing. Just…. Nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>139 ext. big blue bus in motion - morning. 139</strong>:
Through the unusual center window we see Flor and Cristina. Flor, at
this moment, is assimilating against every fiber in her body. Cristina
is excited, certain her life is taking an incandescent turn. Quite a
contrast.</p>
<p><strong>140 ext. stone canyon and sunset - morning 140</strong>: As
the bus stops…Bernice is across the street, along with some other kids
and Deborah, who is wearing her running clothes..Flor and Cristina exit
the bus…</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: You just made it…I was getting
worried..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I picked up your books yesterday.. This is
one of Bernie’s old..ancient backpacks.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Oh, thank you..</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: This is a great school.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I got you a little first-day-at-a-
new-school present…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: It’s from me and….Bernice. Okay? It is a
big day.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: What did we get her?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: It’s from ALL of us. Your mother too.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: It’s not from me…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Have a great year, girls.. This is so
great. It fills your heart, doesn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>141 ext. street - hill - angle on flor… 141</strong>: Walking
up the hill, blinking in disbelief at her own fury..Deborah in the
background feeling a bit abandoned..Flor keeps walking toward the
camera..</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: There is a terrible crisis which comes
when your own personality is not equal to the challenge you face. When
being who you are no longer works.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Left…left.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Left…left…</p>
<p><strong>left!</strong>: Suddenly, Flor breaks into a run..She is
lithe and quick.</p>
<p><strong>on deborah…</strong>: A blink of confusion…then something
resembling innate satisfaction as she quickens her gait and…the Race is
on.</p>
<p><strong>angle as deborah draws abreast of flor.</strong>: Strangely,
she is interpreting this as closeness. She is genuinely warm.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Why am I not surprised you’re
competitive?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh, they’re delivering my table.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You are fast.. Better pace yourself
though..</p>
<p><strong>on deborah..</strong>: Realizing she may not be a certain
winner…she is concerned as she goes after the rabbit.</p>
<p><strong>other angle.</strong>: Showing the delivery truck as finish
line in the distance…</p>
<p><strong>various shots..</strong>: Flor fueled by desperation.
Deborah, relentlessly gaining, exhilarated.</p>
<p><strong>the finish..</strong>: Decidedly anti-climactic..Deborah
draws even – passes her– arrives at the house with a large margin of
victory.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I love you for trying.</p>
<p><strong>142 ext. clasky house - day 142</strong>: She exits into her
home.</p>
<p><strong>on flor..</strong>: Bent over, hands on knees, sweaty,
gasping for breath. Flor finally straightens up and, there being no
other course, continues her walk up the hill, to work.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: When people exist under one roof, a tiny
society forms..the stuff of</p>
<p><strong>143 int. clasky home - night… 143</strong>: As John moves
past Evelyn on his way to work. She looks at him a little wild-eyed as
they both stand in the doorway. Straining a bit for breath.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You feel okay?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No. I’ve given up drinking. I had to do it
John..I need every brain cell to watch out for all of us..given the
current climate. Anyway. John, I think you’re great and I’m going to act
accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Good deal.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Let’s hope.</p>
<p><strong>144 int. flor’s apt. - late afternoon 144</strong>: Flor
cooking alongside Monica — a table is set for ten..A banner proclaiming
BIENVENIDA, MAM�.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: My great Aunt Monica had finally managed
to get her mother to Los Angeles and my mother was making a party.</p>
<p><strong>145 int./ext. deborah’s car / clasky home - day 145</strong>:
Bernice sitting amidst Cristina and two other golden girls as they
arrive at the Clasky home.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I was with my friends who had helped me
understand real optimism.</p>
<p><strong>146 int. clasky house - night 146</strong>: As Deb finishes
dialing a call..Cristina looking on…her two friends watching a movie in
the family room. A clock prominently reads nine p.m.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Flor? Deb..Look, sorry to call you so late,
but they’re still studying and I’m going out but I promised to get her
back so if you want me to cut off the school work, fine…whatever you
want me to do. Well, okay..you think about it.. And hey, if you’re
tired, or want to play, let her sleep here and I’ll get her back there
tomorrow. You still want to think about it? Okay..</p>
<p><strong>147 int. flor’s apt. - night 147</strong>: As Flor hangs
up..</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: Though it is possible to judge harshly my
conduct toward my mother in my first year at school; almost all
professional literature excuses my behavior as developmental, since I
was entering an age where rebellion and narcissism were to be expected.
And I was being mentored.</p>
<p><strong>148 ext./int. clasky front driveway..night 148</strong>: As
Evelyn stands there…a little in the shadows..</p>
<p><strong>her pov…</strong>: Deborah somewhat dolled up moving through
the interior of the house..</p>
<p><strong>149 ext. clasky driveway - night… 149</strong>: As Deborah
leaves the house in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Wait!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I need to talk to you privately, honey.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: “Honey?”– Can’t now, Mom…I’m late..I was
looking all over for you…keep an eye on the kids. You know my secret
cell number.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Just give me a moment to talk here..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What is it? Are you buzzed?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No. I gave up drinking weeks ago. Yes.
Nobody noticed – which shows I probably conducted myself pretty well as
a drunk. But duty called and I’m sober so may I say just one thing.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: One thing..go ahead…</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Thanks..Deborah, you’re going to lose your
husband and you’ll never find someone as good. There will only be men
who you know are cheap and shallow and have no real warmth in their
souls. You may have gotten by on those surfaces once but now you’ve been
spoiled by a good man and you can no longer glide on such thin ice. If
you do not act quickly you will soon cement an awful fate for yourself.
A life, with no hope of repair, which has already begun to turn
desperate and dumb. That’s it. Drive safely.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: If we’re out of coffee, it’s over for
me.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You’ve done it again, Mom, made me hate
myself..One of the things I can count on..</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Honey, lately your low self-esteem is just
good common sense.</p>
<p><strong>150 ext. stone canyon - late night… 150</strong>: Flor
walking from the beginning of the hill……..She looks off to see John’s
vehicle approaching..She brightens..</p>
<p><strong>on john..</strong>: Who doesn’t see her..We can see his car’s

<p><strong>151 int. clasky home - night… 151</strong>: As John
enters..Evelyn, in an adjoining room, moves to intercept him.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: John, better wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What the hell’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Nothing. In all futility, can I urge you not
to go up there.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Denouement.</p>
<p><strong>152 int. master bedroom - night… 152</strong>: John enters
the room on the double…passes Deborah without knowing it.. . As he
passes….camera HOLDS ON DEBORAH..she is a mess…goopy tear stains..seeing
him and his concern brings her grief to a higher ground…a sinner humbled
by goodness..a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Deb..Deb?..where are you?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Here I am.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Baby, what?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: “Baby?” Stay there, John…Sit down..I
suddenly get what I have to do…I just have to get the guts.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Is it absolutely necessary to make it
this…this scary..can you just say it?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Not so easy.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah..come on..it’s me. We can talk.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Do I ever hope so…I’ve been seeing another
man for the last eleven weeks and it was nothing and I ended it
tonight..At first it was just keeping an eye on the real estate
market..Then it was…what? Me being insecure and looking for some
ridiculous vali…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Go – hold on…hold on…I’m missing what you’re
saying..You can’t just keep talking and expect me to follow it when you
start the way you did…….</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Just what did you hear?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well there was the crack in the planet. That
was noisy…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: There’s an actual noise in my head…..no
kidding..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I met him about…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I met him..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: If you talk that fast…I’ll never hear
you..there’s a lot going through my mind….Have you said yet whether you
slept with him?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: So far I’ve just been talking about a
flirtation because the really important thing for you to know…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Have you said yet whether you’ve had sex with
someone else? Because I really am missing most of your words. So help me
out here..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I’ve been trying to explain that for the
first ten weeks there was almost nothing to …</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You still haven’t said, right?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Is this your way of…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is my way of…this is my way of asking you
whether..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh man, once I ask it…give me a second. I’m
just trying to figure out whether there’s any way to avoid knowing..no,
damn There’s not… Okay, you’re on..real short answer, huh? Have you had
sex with another..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I know you’re very angry?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ahhhh…I’m getting there, yes.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: John? I think if you let me tell you the
full everything of this we’d be in a position to deal with it
better..because eleven weeks ago when…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You don’t believe that I miss your words..I
get three or four tops…and then just see your mouth moving with nothing
coming out and then I spin out and there’s this noise…But there’s no way
to miss a “yes” or “no.”</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Yes..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I made up my mind that I would answer every
question you had..I’ll answer anything and everything and more.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What other questions could there be?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Are you really that much nicer than me?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, you don’t set the bar real high.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: No. Please, please, please..I think if you
listen to exactly what happened and then do whatever you need
to…we’ll..just let me tell you everything..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh, it’s just Flor.</p>
<p><strong>153 ext. stone canyon night.. 153</strong>: As Flor enters
the Clasky House…</p>
<p><strong>154 int. clasky house - late night 154</strong>: Flor sees
Evelyn in the living room.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I want Cristina. I want to talk to
Mrs. Clasky. I want to quit.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I don’t think you can do any of it right
this minute..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Oh, yes..Where’s Cristina?</p>
<p><strong>155 int. master bedroom - night 155</strong>: Deborah can
barely look at him…</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: …then, when I was driving back tonight
after I ended the whole yuck thing..I was feeling human. I’m done with
what’s his name..a relief… ..and now it can be like it never happened
and then I thought that the only hope was that I own that it did happen
and that I take my medicine here..because if I’m walking around with
what I did and you don’t know what I did..there is a real limit to how
close we can be..you’re with me and I’m this person who has this bad
secret and we aren’t really on the same page ever again..so the reason I
took this chance in telling – is because I want us to be good..I want us
to be close. I want to feel like you’re not nuts to be in love with
me..So what I think is we should talk till we pass out .. Talk till
we’re so sick of each other that there’s nothing left to do but take the
first step out of hell..So please let’s not leave this room until you’ve
heard and said everything..please say, okay..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: John..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ve got to get out of here..because you keep
talking. Stay put!</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You’ve got to say something.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You are a terrible wife.</p>
<p><strong>156 int. maid’s room - night… 156</strong>: Evelyn stands in
the doorway with Flor..they are looking at Cristina and her two friends
sleeping together.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I don’t think you want to wake her when
you’re this upset and the other kids are right there and…</p>
<p><strong>157 int. entrance hall - night 157</strong>: As they arrive
at the interior entrance, John comes down the stairs just as Flor opens
the front door.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I’m leaving….I have finally..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Me too..I’ll drive you.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes..come on…it’s past midnight here.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: If you truly don’t know why I say “no” let me
at last say the reason. At least that will be a relief. Have you no idea
that I….</p>
<p><strong>other angle.</strong>: As Chum, now the only happy creature
in the house, fetches it and returns.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look I have to get out of here right now..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Go..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Goodbye, Chum.</p>
<p><strong>on chum.</strong>: No longer happy. He has lost his only easy
mark. He stares at the closed door..the ball drops from his mouth to the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>158 ext. clasky driveway - night… 158</strong>: John is at
the car but Flor heads for the gate.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m taking you.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Why?!?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because if I don’t – I’ll worry about you and
I can’t handle that right now, okay?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Ahhhhh. I never made that sound over a man
before..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Please!?! Mandil�n.</p>
<p><strong>other angle..</strong>: Deborah watching them…</p>
<p><strong>her pov.</strong>: Her cuckolded husband closing the door
behind her gorgeous, soon-to-be ex-housekeeper.</p>
<p><strong>close on deborah..</strong>: She trembles under the force of
imminent justice.</p>
<p><strong>159 int. john’s car - late night 159</strong>: Two pissed-off
people..jaws set…breathing labored..As the car starts and Flor looks
back, she lets out a guttural and explosive shout…</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Arrchhhhhyeeeeiii!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes! Exactly! Well put! Teach me that word
sometime. I can really use it.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I quit this job!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I quit this job!!!!!</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: That’s the bus stop.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’ll take you home.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No. Drop me at a bus.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, shut up and stop telling me what to
do.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Okay…then let’s do something besides driving
me home where my daughter isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay..we’ll do something.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: And I’m supposed to figure out what because
I’m a housekeeper and you don’t have to think.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Oh, don’t do the class thing, man..You don’t
know where I come from.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Alright, I know. But I can’t be responsible no
more for making sure nothing happens. That’s another terrible job I
quit.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are you talking about? I take
responsibility for anything within a block. You have nothing to worry
about. That’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Excellent. So you’re going to figure out what
we do, right?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yes. Okay. Big man figure out!</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Stop there.</p>
<p><strong>160 ext. mall parking lot - late night. 160</strong>: As she
leaves the car and goes into a drug store. John, sober faced, looks at
Flor making an attractive and zestful beeline toward an Hispanic market.
This could be where it hits him that he’s on a date…If so..it’s too late
to duck..</p>
<p><strong>161 int. mexican market - late night. 161</strong>: As Flor
enters the market..She calls to the young shop girl as Marine medics for
morphine.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Maquillaje!</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: The shop girl directs her to the make-up
counter where she starts shopping..lip gloss, blush, eye stuff..She
starts applying it at the check out counter.</p>
<p><strong>162 ext. outdoor mall - late night 162</strong>: As she runs
back to the car.</p>
<p><strong>163 int. john’s vehicle - 163</strong>: As she enters, there
is a fury to her which he almost matches.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: This is me when I’m not working.. You have
never seen me!</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, you look familiar.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: So, “man,” where we heading?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t think I can handle public..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Yes, no…lots of people right now is..</p>

<p><strong>164 int. john’s restaurant - night… 164</strong>: As they
enter the main restaurant…</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I’ve never seen your place. Very perfect.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m going to cook, Beautiful. I’m going to
cook beautifully.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Hey..please..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: We both were not normal because we are angry
and we act like we are angry with each other and we are not..I am not. I
am glad to be with you. It feels comfortable to be with you. If I just
left the job and never spoke with you it would have been sin. You
understand?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Ummmmmmmmm…Yes.</p>
<p><strong>rear angle..the pat on the back.</strong>: The pat is
becoming a rub..he cups her back..slides his hand..she responds just a
bit..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I think I’m inventing a horrible new way of
making out..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Not so horrible…..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: My hand is the only sane part of my
body..every other part wants to jump off a cliff.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: If the other hand could cheer up, you could
lift me up and carry me off.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t know how to handle that one. I think I
already broke my record for smooth.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s me. I’m not making sense. But I can get
you fed.</p>
<p><strong>165 int. restaurant kitchen - night 165</strong>: As John
starts cooking up a storm…there is some velocity to his cooking…he still
seethes. Then reacts as Spanish Music starts to play. He clears his
throat as if he must make a speech. Then does so again..some vocal spasm
paying tribute to the increasingly intoxicating tension he feels.</p>
<p><strong>166 int. restaurant - dining area - night… 166</strong>: Flor
is lighting the candle at each of the twenty tables.</p>
<p><strong>167 int. restaurant kitchen - night… 167</strong>: He is
cooking..He is talking to himself.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Nothing to be nervous about. You are not on a
date… Hey, Flor?</p>
<p><strong>flor’s voice</strong>: Yes, John.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Just lighting candles and picking music.
Oooh.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I, uh…don’t think you should either.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Then excuse me, because if I had the equipment
I’d inject the vodka.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Wait! I think it is so important that we are
each clear-headed.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: It is very good that you did not ask,
“why?”</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Keep things real, right?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I wouldn’t have put it so well.</p>
<p><strong>168 int. restaurant kitchen - half hour later - night
168</strong>: They sit at a small table in the kitchen..finishing the
greatest late-night meal in the history of Western man.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I will remember every taste..forever.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Tell you the truth..I wanted a shot at cooking
for you. I’m very glad you liked it.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: It’s something watching you.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Well, if it’s anything at your end imagine
over here…scratch that..the last thing you want to hear is somebody
going off on your looks.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Don’t be crazy. Tell me every detail.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Okay, Flor, yes I will…They should name a
gender after you..Looking at you doesn’t do it..Staring is the only
thing that makes sense..and trying not to blink so you don’t miss
anything.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Look..forgive me..I’m…..It’s just that you are
drop-dead, crazy- gorgeous..so much so that I am really considering
looking at you again before we finish up here.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Soon, please.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Right now….immediately..we have to dance or
kiss.</p>
<p><strong>his pov..</strong>: Her face..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No contest.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: You sure you’re not Mexican.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I meant you talk like a Spanish song.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You kiss like a Spanish fly.. Joking around. I
don’t know what I’m talking about…</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Yes you do.</p>
<p><strong>169 int. restaurant - dining room. 169</strong>: As Flor
rummages for another CD, enjoying every minute. She places the disk in
the player and exits.</p>
<p><strong>170 int. restaurant kitchen. 170</strong>: As she
returns…</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: This song…You see what a good thing to tell
you how you talk like a Mexican song.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: When I kiss you, entire oceans rush through my
veins.. Gardens of flowers blossom in my body.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: And you wander along my fertile soil, picking
its ripe fruit..A nightingale undresses on my tongue..And under its
wings..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m sorry. I don’t know what I just took out
of you but tell me how to get it back in there..I’m sorry. Flor..I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>close on her..</strong>: The downcast eyes rise to see
him..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Then respect this.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Here’s something I never asked anyone..Did
nightingales undress on your tongue?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Did they on yours?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: reflection/then sincere</p>
<p><strong>171 ext. restaurant - some time later 171</strong>: Moving
camera…the small house turned restaurant..little flickers of light…</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: My mother never told me the details of her
visit to the restaurant. But she often referred to it as the greatest
conversation of her life.</p>
<p><strong>172 int. restaurant - very late night… 172</strong>: They are
lying post coitally in each other’s arms on a sofa just inside the
dining room..They are covered by a table cloth. They hold hands above
the cover…each private but still somehow in contact.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Oh, Johnny, why is everything so damn
confusing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Culpa.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Is your mind racing?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I would say my mind has evaporated…but that
there are remnants still standing waiting to fall. It feels pretty
good.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Like happy?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like happy.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: You think that will last?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s already gone.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I understand what you mean.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I don’t understand what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: That it’s getting late. That responsibilities
have entered your brain. Don’t hide that from me. And really, one large
reason we are here is because you respect me as a mother and I respect
you as a father..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re a great and wild mother.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: You are a beautiful father.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: When Cristina was young, I would say I want to
take any man who wants me to the park and I will tell whether I want him
from the way he is with Cristina. I wish you had been in the park then.
Any reaction?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Exactly!..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: You know, I always think about when you…Oh,
there’s no point. I talk too much… …because I don’t know if we ever talk
again.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Hey, hey..How do you get there? Wait.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Yes you do. Be honest.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I’m being honest. Look at us - I think I call
it honesty.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: What are we going to do – go home, let our
hearts go back in our bodies, see each other a few more times. Make a
tragedy out of us..</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Ahhhhhhh. There are some mistakes you cannot
risk when you have kids…Please, are you ready to go?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: No. I’m not. No. Stay put for a second. Stay
here. Once our feet touch that floor, I’m going to get too many brain
cells back. So don’t be in such a hurry. That floor, Flor, is going to
eat us alive. So you think it was a mistake up to now. That’s rough.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: The mistake….I love it.</p>
<p><strong>173 int. clasky home - master bedroom - late night.
173</strong>: Deborah’s face is bleached from crying…the tear ducts of
her now brown eyes are parched dry..Evelyn sits eyeing her as she looks
through the window at the pre-dawn emptiness of Stone Canyon. In her
current shape she would give pause to a staff worker at Promises..a
shock victim walking through the rubble after the bomb has dropped.
Deborah’s voice is scratchy when she speaks.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Tell me again why I can’t call him on the
cell.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Besides that he turned it off?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Forty messages start to look needy.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Mother, you’re enjoying this.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No..Definitely not in the way you think.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You are enjoying it?!?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: I am enjoying actually being of use to my
daughter. I am enjoying the fact that I really know how to advise you
and the miracle that you are so deeply disoriented that you are gobbling
up everything I say.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: There’s one thing I’d like to say to you
about you and me.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You don’t have to.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I want to.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You were an alcoholic and wildly
promiscuous woman during my formative years so that I am in this fix
because of you. It is your fault. I just needed.. ..that moment for
us.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You have a solid point, dear. But right now
the lessons of my life are coming in handy for you.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: There’s a car coming….</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: It’s him…he’s got to tell me
everything..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Do you know that right now you are your own
worst enemy..that you can’t trust one thought in your brain?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Duh.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Then trust me and only allow yourself to say
one thing to him..One thing…“I’m so glad you’re back.”</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: But I’ve got to know whether he touched her
- where he touched her - how he touched her - if they broke a sweat —
what they said - who made the first move - how they left it – if anyone
loves anyone or has an intention of making contact in the future - what
she wore - how he felt afterwards - whether anyone mentioned me..
..whether they held hands when they left..</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Just those words I said. If you want a
prayer of coming out of this.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I know you’re right..But..</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I forgot the sentence you said I should
say.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: “I’m so glad you’re back.”</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Okay..do I have to wait here?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: No..he may not come up here..go to him.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Why wouldn’t he come up here?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Just go.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Do I need a little makeup?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You need a hose but you don’t have the time.
It’s fine that you look like that. It’s genuine..You can use
genuine.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Thank you, mom.</p>
<p><strong>174 int. stairwell 174</strong>: She pauses at the top of the
stairs..a breath..then unable to help herself runs down them at
breakneck speed.</p>
<p><strong>175 int. downstairs.. 175</strong>: John turning a light on
when Deborah bursts into the room.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I’m so glad to see you ..that you’re
back.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: It’s late, Deborah.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Well, I just wanted to say.. what I
said..</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Uhhhh..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I can’t sleep upstairs with you.. Just can’t
for now.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I’m just so glad you’re back.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Yeah..okay.</p>
<p><strong>176 int. master bedroom - night 176</strong>: Evelyn, who has
been standing close to the doorway, stands clear to let her enter. As
Deborah flies in wildly vulnerable - her breath racing.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I am literally choking on unsaid
words..seriously. If this were a restaurant ten people would have their
knuckles in my sternum.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: The fact that you didn’t just make things
worse should fill you with hope..</p>
<p><strong>177 int. maid’s room - night… 177</strong>: The first time
we’ve seen this room since Flor was working the sewing machine…John
enters. He is down, longing and finality make for a brutal cocktail..He
rubs his head and sits near the sewing machine..He glances over and sees
Flor’s Spanish/English dictionary..There is a knock on the door.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Deb, I’m done tonight. I don’t think we can
jam anything else in.</p>
<p><strong>bernice’s voice</strong>: It’s me, Dad.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: What’s up, honey?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Just thought I’d check that you were back
and okay and all.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Because?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Mom was crying for six hours straight and
Grandma was in with her all that time mostly saying, “he’ll be
back..he’ll be back.” I’ve got to get back to Georgie.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I just hate that you had that kind of a
night.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: It’s good for me to worry about something
that really matters instead of the stupid stuff that’s usually on my
mind…</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Like?</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Surviving.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re fantastic, Bernie…I love you.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: It’s a slant… Hey..I know there’s a lot you
went through but I knew all along that Grandma was right about you
coming back..I mean totally knew it so I wasn’t that worried. But still
I… I really appreciate it, Dad. Thanks….Stop staring at me..what? You
don’t know what to say?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Right. I don’t know what to say.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Just what you taught me..You’re
welcome.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>178 ext. stone canyon - morning. 178</strong>: Flor
purposefully walking up the hill..</p>
<p><strong>179 int. clasky house - day. 179</strong>: As Flor
enters…walks through a few empty rooms..then once in the kitchen she
sees the children and Evelyn are swimming in the pool…she opens the
glass door Monica bumped into on interview day.</p>
<p><strong>180 ext. clasky pool - day. 180</strong>: Evelyn, Bernice and
Georgie are in the pool..Cristina, wearing a bathing suit, is on a
chaise reading…</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Hey, mom…Is it okay if we don’t leave
right away?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No… No..and we must say “goodbye.” I don’t
work here anymore.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Do I have to get out?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No, Georgie..Stay. I think you are a wonderful
boy..be good..like you are. There are no monsters.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Thanks..thanks. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I can’t believe you didn’t get out.</p>
<p><strong>georgie</strong>: Flor said.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: I don’t want to get you wet.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Get me wet.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: You…are…a…trip.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: You’re a beauty. Amazing girl.</p>
<p><strong>bernice</strong>: My last chance to have some of you rub off
on me.. I’m sorry you’re so sad but this could have been so much
worse.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>evelyn</strong>: Why don’t you run upstairs and say goodbye
to Deborah?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I’ll be in front.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Please come see me.</p>
<p><strong>deborah’s voice</strong>: It’s okay, honey..we’ll see each
other at school..I’m going to keep an eye on you..I will.</p>
<p><strong>181 int. kitchen - day. 181</strong>: She stands
waiting..walks to the hallway and cranes her head to see into rooms,
wondering if John is there. Finally, as she passes the stairwell, she
sees Cristina on an upper landing and says, in Spanish, that Cristina
should get her things and meet her out front. Cristina, agitated, moves
off to comply…then Deborah appears in the same spot.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Please stick your head in here for a
minute.</p>
<p><strong>182 int. master bedroom - day 182</strong>: Deborah holds
open the door while Flor walks inside..then closes it.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: What’s with avoiding me, am I this horrible
person?</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: I know. It’s a ridiculous question but
sometimes I’m ridi…</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No. It’s a good question. A fine question.
Complicated. I was just thinking to answer.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Oh stop. Come on. Weren’t we close?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Well, I’m very, very disappointed to hear
that. It makes me feel like a fool.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: We weren’t close..but we were connected…in a
bad way.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: You know something, I think we’re saying
the same thing…Look as long as we’re doing closure..What did you and my
husband, John, do last night?</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I can only tell you what I did.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: That will be sufficient.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: I became sure of what an incredibly lucky
woman you are and I must make myself not envy you which is hard. No,
it’s not hard. It’s impossible. Now please..I am exhausted.</p>
<p><strong>deborah</strong>: Same here - believe me.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Cristina, ap�rate.</p>
<p><strong>183 ext. clasky house - day 183</strong>: As she exits the
house and moves to the gate where she punches in the exit code…</p>
<p><strong>angle on gate</strong>: As it swings open to reveal John…</p>
<p><strong>184 ext. street - day. 184</strong>: As she moves alongside
him and the gate closes behind her.</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: I was hanging out here waiting. Can’t give you
guys a lift?</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: This is killer. Incredibly hard.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Yes, Cari..</p>
<p><strong>john</strong>: Let her have it..party favors.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Cristina..</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: Goodbye, Mr. Clasky..I am very sorry we
will not see each other as frequently.</p>
<p><strong>flor</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>shot - stone canyon</strong>: The women walking toward
camera, John briefly in the background…As they begin their walk Flor
begins talking in Spanish.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: The first minute we were alone, my mother
told me that I would no longer go to the private school.</p>
<p><strong>cristina</strong>: No. No..You can’t. I won’t be able to
forgive you..It will be the end. I won’t let you.</p>
<p><strong>closer shot..</strong>: So we can see their faces in the
struggle.</p>
<p><strong>185 ext. bus stop.. 185</strong>: As they wait…Flor talks
sharply to Cristina to control herself.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: My mother changed our lives once more.
This time because she saw in me, to her great alarm, a character flaw of
some size. She has taught me to be a watch dog of my character, to
control my ambition. I am not quite there.</p>
<p><strong>186 int. bus - day. 186</strong>: Almost empty - it’s
Saturday. Mother and daughter sit together by the giant window in the
center of the bus. Cristina eyes her mother who is bearing her own
heartbreak with stoic dignity. The girl is becoming less inconsolable
and more in need of mothering.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: For that reason should you choose to grant
me your scholarship my mother, at my request, will be relocating to the
New York Metropolitan Area so that she can stay close during my time at
Princeton.</p>
<p><strong>narrator</strong>: I hope my essay has done her justice. I
love her with all my heart.</p>
