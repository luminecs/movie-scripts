minute later. BOURNE moves out onto the veranda.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Where were you, Jason?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: In the car. Conklin up front.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I’ll get the book.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: No. There’s nothing new.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: You’re sure? We should still – we should
write it down.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Two years we’re scribbling in a notebook
–</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: – it hasn’t been two years –</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: – it’s alwa ys bad and it’s never anything
but bits and piece s anyway! You ever thi nk that maybe i t’s just
making it wo rse? You don’t wonder that?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: We write them down because sooner or later
you’re going to remember something good.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I do remember something good. All the time.
I remember you.</p>
<p><strong>4 int. cottage bedroom – night</strong>: MARIE getting BOURNE
into the bed. Turning down the light. Getting him settled. Waiting for
that pill to kick in. What would he do without her?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I’m trying, Marie, Okay?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I worry when you get like this.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: It’s just a nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I don’t mean that. I worry when you try to
ignore it.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Sleep. Sleep now.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I should be better by now.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: You are better. And I think it’s not memories
at all. It’s just a dream you keep having over and over.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: But it ends up the same.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: One day it will be different. It just takes
time. We’ll make new memories. You and me.</p>
<p><strong>5 ext. beach – goa/beachtown – day</strong>: BOU RNE running
in the sun. A punishing pace along the san d. Moving strong. Effortless.
Deep into it. Focused. The stunning conjunction of sun and scenery are
lost on him .</p>
<p><strong>moving with him as</strong>: BOURNE follows THE SILVER CAR on
foot – natural – cruising the BUSY SIDEWALK – blending into the mix –
chugging on that water bottle and –</p>
<p><strong>back to</strong>: BOURNE slowing as he reaches the corner
–</p>
<p><strong>mr. mohan</strong>: And your question, sir?</p>
<p><strong>kirill</strong>: She’s my sister. There’s been a death in the
family. This is the last place we know she called from.</p>
<p><strong>rapid time cuts</strong>: – BACKPACKS thrown open on the bed.
– HOUSE CASH pulled from a lamp base. – CREDIT CARDS taped under the
counter.</p>
<p><strong>18 ext. beach – goa/beachtown – day</strong>: Crowded with
tourists – sunbathers – MARIE at her favorite spot. Talking with TWO
WOMEN, laughing with them - - happy.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: We gotta go, Marie. We gotta go, now.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: We’re blown.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: No… How?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: The Telegraph office.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: But we were so careful.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: We pushed it. We got lazy.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: But you’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: He was at the campground yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: So…</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: It’s wrong. Guy with a rental car and
hundred dollar sneakers sleeps in a tent?</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: That’s crazy.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: No. Not thi s. This is real. And he’s rig ht
there…</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Where –</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Back there – at the corner – Hyundai –
silver –</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: …but you’re not – you’re not sure…</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: We can’t wait to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I don’t want to move again…I like it
here.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Loo k, we clear out, we get to the shack, we
get safe. We hang there awhile. I’ll com e back. I’ll check it out. But
right now we can’t –</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: – where’s left to go? –</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: – there’s places – we can’t afford to be
wrong!</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: You drive.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Switch! You drive!</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: – where? –</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: – make the left – toward the bridge –</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: – Jesus! – – is he back there? –</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: – not yet –</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: – it’s just him? –</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: – yeah – one guy – I don’t think he was
ready –</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: – hang on –</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: You keep going to the shack. I’ll meet you
there in an hour.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I’m going to bail on the other side and
wait. This bridge is the only way he can follow.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: What if it’s not who you think it is?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: If he crosses the bridge, it is.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: There must be another way!</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I warned them, Marie. I told them to leave
us alone.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Jason, please don’t do this…it won’t ever be
over like this.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: There’s no choice.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: At the end make the left, when I roll out do
not slow down.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Tell me later.</p>
<p><strong>b34 ext. low wall – day</strong>: KIRILL. Eye to the
scope.</p>
<p><strong>38 ext. river bottom – day</strong>: Mud plumes as the JEEP

<p><strong>teddy/radio</strong>: He’s inside.</p>

<p><strong>76 int. cia situation room/langley, virginia – day</strong>:
THREE MEN – CIA MANDARINS – sit around a round table. MARTIN MARSHALL,
Deputy Vice-Director, he’s in charge. All is tense.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: I’m here. So is Donnie and Jack Weller. We
understand you’re using the full allocation for this buy?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: That’s where we came out.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: It’s a lot of money, Pam.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: We’re talking raw, unprocessed KGB files.
It’s not something we can go out and comparison shop.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Still…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: For a thief. A mole. I ve tted the sou rce,
Marty. He’s real. If it does not hing more than narrow th e list of sus
pects, it’s a bargain at ten times the pri ce.</p>
<p><strong>mandarin #1</strong>: Pamela, Jack Weller here. It’s the
quality that’s at issue…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Yes, sir. I ’m in total agr eement. If
they’re fake s, they’re expe nsive. Gentlemen, I ’ve got the sel ler on
site and in play. Qu ite honestly, t here’s not much more to talk
about.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: All right Pam, your game, your call…</p>
<p><strong>cronin/radio</strong>: “Final Green. You are go. Repeat, you
are go for Final Green.”</p>
<p><strong>vic/radio</strong>: “On my way up.”</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: Here?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Now. Show now.</p>
<p><strong>caspiex-petroleum</strong>: Cherbourg – Moscow – Rome –
Tehran</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: This is everything?</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: Is there. Is all there.</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: – what the hell is that? – alone – you said
alone –</p>
<p><strong>ivan</strong>: – no! – not me! – no other people! –</p>
<p><strong>vic</strong>: – shut up! – just shut the –</p>
<p><strong>85 int. berlin hq/command post – night</strong>: As they
were. Waiting. But only a moment before –</p>
<p><strong>teddy/radio</strong>: “Hub? – we just – we lost power – the
building ! – the whole place just went dark! - -”</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: “– repeat – who is dark? – the target
building or your location? –”</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: We need to get in there.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: I’m working on it.</p>
<p><strong>a93 int. shack – goa – day</strong>: BOURNE is bailing.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: – so there were two of the se explosive
charges plac ed on the power lines. One of them failed. The fingerpri
nt… That’s from the one that di dn’t go off.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: And the Germans can’t match it?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Nobody’s got it. We checked every database we
could access. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: Show her the other thing.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: This is a KG B file that must’ve fallen
somehow and then slipped under, I guess, a desk there, or…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Do we know what this says?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Yup… The main word there, the file heading,
translates as: Treadstone.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: What the hell is a “Treadstone?”</p>
<p><strong>97 int. c.i.a. headquarters – day</strong>: A long, bright,
sterile hallway. PAMELA and CRONIN walking briskly alongside A UNIFORMED
S.P.S. OFFICER.</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: Ward?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: Pamela Landy.</p>
<p><strong>abbott/phone</strong>: What can I do for you, Pam?</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: I was hoping you had some time for
me.</p>
<p><strong>abbott/phone</strong>: Time for what?</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: I’m free right now actually.</p>
<p><strong>abbott/phone</strong>: That sounds ominous. Let me check my
schedule.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Treadstone.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: That’s not gonna fly.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: With all due respect, Pam, I think you
might’ve wandered a little past your pay- grade.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Tha t’s a warrant from Director Marshall gra
nting me unrestricted access to all per sonnel and materials associated
with Tre adstone.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: And what are we looking for?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I want to know about Treadstone.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: To know abou t it? It was a kil l squad.
Black on black. Closed down two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Nobody wants to know about Treadstone. Not
around h ere. You better t ake this back to Marty and make sure he knows
what you’re doing.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: He does. I’ve been down to the archives. I
have the files, Ward.</p>
<p><strong>naples</strong>: FERRY – BOURNE at the rail. Unchanged from
India. Staring ahead as Europe looms.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Let’s talk about Conklin.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: What are you after, Pam? You want to fry me?
You want my desk? Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I want to know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: d? Jason Bourn e happened.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Bou rne was h is number one - - guy went out
to work, scr ewed the op and never cam e bac k. Conkl in couldn’t fix
it, could n’t fin d Bourne, couldn’t adjus t. It all went sid eways. F
inally there we re no opti ons lef t.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: So you had Conklin killed. I mean, if we’re
cutting the crap…</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: I’ve given t hirty years and two marri ages
to this agen cy. I’ve shove led shit o n four contine nts. I’m due t o
retire n ext year and bel ieve me, I need my pensio n, but if you t hink
I’m gonna sit here a nd let you dang le me with this , you can go to
hell. Marsh all too. It had to be done.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: And Bourne? Where’s he now?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Dead in a ditch? Drunk in a bar in
Mogadishu? Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: It hink I do . We had a dea l going down in
Berlin la st week. Durin g the buy, both our Fie ld Agent and th e
seller were killed. We pulled a finger print from a timing charg e that
didn’t g o off. They were ki lled by Jason Bourne.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: They’re ready for us upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>int. c.i.a. relay station – bethesda, maryland – day
116</strong>: 116</p>
<p><strong>117 int. ferry building customs hall – sunset</strong>:
Looking up from his computer, the IMMIGRATION OFFICER gestures BOURNE to
one side.</p>
<p><strong>pamela’s</strong>: Seven years ago, twelve million dollars
was stolen from a CIA account…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: …in Warsaw. This is…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: … Ivan Meve dev – senior f inancial man ager
– w orked for one o f the new Rus sian petr oleum companies , Pecos Oil.
He claimed t o know where th e money landed. We believe t his could have
only happened wit h help fr om someone insi de the Age ncy… T his…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: …this is Conklin’s computer.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: … At the ti me of his death, Conklin was sit
ting on a personal account in the amo unt of se ven-hundred and sixty
tho usand dol lars.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Do you know what his budget was?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: We were throwing money at him. Throwing it
at him and asking him to keep it dark.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: May I finish?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Conklin migh t’ve been a nut , but he wasn’t
a mol e. You have me his calendar for a couple of days, I’ll prove he
killed Linco ln. This is supp osed to be defi nitive?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: What’s definitive, is that I just lost two
people in Berlin!</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: So what’s yo ur theory? Conklin’s re aching
out from the grave to protect his good name? The man is d ead.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: No one’s disputing that, Ward.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: For crissake, Marty, you knew Conklin. Does
this scan? I mean, at all?</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Okay, cut to the chase, Pam. What are you
selling?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I think that Bourne and Conklin were in
business. That Bourne is still involved.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: And that wha tever information I was going
to buy in Be rlin, it was big enough to make Bourne come out from
wherever he’s been hiding to kill again. How’s that s can?</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: Hey… Look, you’re not gonna believe this, but
Jason Bourne ’s passport just came on the grid in Napl es.</p>
<p><strong>nevins</strong>: …what can I do? I can’t. I’ll call you when
I know what I’m into… I don’t know , some guy’s name came up on the
computer . So start wit hout me, if I can get there, I will. Later …</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: Looks like he’s been detained.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Who’s going? Us?</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: There’s only a Consulate, they sent a field
officer out half an hour ago –</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Then get a number, they need to know who
they’re dealing with.</p>
<p><strong>nevins</strong>: Alright, Mr. Bourne, is that your name?
Name’s Nevin s. I’m with the US Consulate. Could I see your
passport?</p>
<p><strong>nevins</strong>: So, Mr. Bourne…</p>
<p><strong>nevins</strong>: What are you doing in Tangiers?</p>
<p><strong>nevins</strong>: Are you travelling alone?</p>
<p><strong>nevins</strong>: Look, I don’t know what you’ve done. But,
you’re gonna need to play ball here.</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: This is Pamela Landy, a CI Supervisor
calling from Langley, Virginia. Are you with a Jason Bourne now?</p>
<p><strong>nevins</strong>: Yes…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Then use extreme caution. He can be very
unpredictable and violent. Use whatever means necessary to…</p>
<p><strong>127 int. ferry/security holding room – night</strong>: NEVINS
stirring, the CARABINIERI still out. A phone starts to RING. Nevins’
phone. Finally sitting up, he answers.</p>
<p><strong>nevins</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>130 int. c.i.a. situation room – day</strong>: PAMELA at the
other end of the line.</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: Mr. Nevins?</p>
<p><strong>nevins/phone</strong>: Who’s this?</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: Pamela Landy, again. Where do we
stand?</p>
<p><strong>nevins/phone</strong>: I think… I think he got away.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Have you locked down the area?</p>
<p><strong>nevins/phone</strong>: Ah, we’re in Italy. They don’t exactly
“lock down” real quick…</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: How long have you worked for the
agency?</p>
<p><strong>nevins/phone</strong>: Me? Four years.</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: If you ever want to make it to five,
you ’re gonna listen to me r eal close. Jas on Bourne is armed and e
xtremely dan gerous. A week ago, he assassinated two men in B erlin, one
of w hom was a hig hly-exper ienced field of ficer…</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: I want that area secured, I want any
evidence secured and I want it done now. Is that clear??</p>
<p><strong>nevins/phone</strong>: Yes, sir – ma’am…</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: I’m getting on a plane to B erlin in
45 min utes, whi ch means you ar e going to call me back in 3 0, and
when I a sk you where we sta nd, I had better be impr essed. My mob ile
numbe r is…</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Berlin!</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I’ve already got a team there. I doubt
Bourne’s in Naples to settle down and raise a family.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: You don’t know what you’re getting into
here.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: And you do? From the moment he left
Treadstone, he has killed and eluded every person that you sent to find
him…</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: Enough. I want both of you on that
plane.</p>
<p><strong>marshall</strong>: And we are - - all of us – going to d o
what we were either too laz y or inept to do the last time around –
you’re goi ng to find this so nofabitch and t ake him do wn before he de
stroys any more of this agency. Is that defi nitive enough for you?</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: – Kurt’s reopening all the wyfi and sat
links –</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: – uplink al l relevant files to Kim – – and
I wan t them to contact anyone who had anything to do with Treadstone
–</p>
<p><strong>pamela/tape</strong>: “Jason Bourne is armed and extremely
dangerous…”</p>
<p>****: “…a week ago he assassinated two men in Berlin, one a
highly…”</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: So your cover at the time was what?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: That I was an American student in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: What exactly did your job with Treadstone in
Paris consist of?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Ih ad two re sponsibilities. One was to coo
rdinate l ogistical operations. Th e oth er was to monitor the health of
th e age nts, to m ake sure they were up to date wit h their m
edications.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: Health, meaning what?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Their mental health. Because of what they’d
been through. They were prone to a variety of problems.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: What kind of problems?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Depression. Anger. Compulsive behaviors. They
had physical symptoms – headaches – sensitivity to light –</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Amnesia?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Before this? Before Bourne? No.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Were you familiar with the training
program?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: The details? No. I mean, I was told it was
voluntary. I don’t kno w if that’s true or not, but that’s wha t I was
told. Look, they took vulnerable subjects, okay? You mix that with th e
right pharmacology and some serio us behavior modification, and, I don’t
know, I mean, I guess anything’s possible .</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: The jet’s ready. There’s a car for you.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: You were his local contact. You were with
him the night Conklin died. You’re coming with us.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I’m curious about Bourne. Your int erpretati
on of his condi tion. You have spe cific training in the ide ntificati
on and diagnosi s of psy chologica l conditions?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Am I a doctor, no, but…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Are you an expert in amnesia?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Look, what do you want me to say? I was
there. I believed him.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Believed what?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I believed Jason Bourne had suffered a severe
traumatic breakdown.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: So he fooled you.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: If you say so.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Not good eno ugh. You’re the person who flo
ated this amnesia story. Eve r feel so rry for him? For what he’d bee n
through ?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You’re making it out like we’re friends here
or something. I met him alone twice.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: You felt nothing? No spark? Two young people
in Paris? Dangerous missions? Life and death?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You mean, did I want a date?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: These were killers. Conklin had them all
jacked up. They were Dobermans.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Some women like Dobermans –</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What do you want from me? I was reassigned.
I’m out.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: See , that’s a problem for me, Nicky. Wha
tever he’s doing, we need to end it. Thi s isn’t the kind of mess you
walk away fro m.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: – so far Bourne’s had no contact with any one
on the list – Langley pulled an ima ge out of Naples, it’s uploading
right now .</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Coming in now…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Is it him?</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: He’s not hiding, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: Why Naples? Why now?</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Could be random.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: Maybe he’s running.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: On his own passport?</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: What’s he actually doing?</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: What’s he doing? He’s making his first
mistake…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It’s not a m istake. They don’t m ake
mistakes. And they don’t do random. There’s always an objective, always
a tar get. If he’s in N aples, on his own passport, there’s a re
ason.</p>
<p><strong>d138 int. the peugeot – night</strong>: BOURNE driving hard.
Pushing the car through the night. Mission Bourne. As the MUSIC KEEPS
JUST BUILDING AND BUILDING, taking us into –</p>
<p><strong>142 ext. anonymous munich neighborhood – day</strong>:
Discreet and chilly. A car pulls up. A MAN gets out.</p>
<p><strong>munich</strong>: We don’t see his face as he heads in.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I emptied it.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: Felt a little light.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Drop it.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: Sorry. Old habits.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: Word in the ether was you’d lost your
memory.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: You still should’ve moved.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: I like it here.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: Last time I saw you was Greece. You had a
good spot.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: I had the gi rl. I had her lined up that
whole aftern oon. Waiting for you, that was the prob lem. You ever do
two targets? It’s tough.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: So why didn’t you kill me then?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: She wouldn’t let me. She’s the only reason
you’re alive.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Conklin.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: He’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Try again.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: Shot dead in Paris. Dead the night you walked
out.</p>
<p><strong>bourne/phone</strong>: Then who runs Treadstone?</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: Nobody. They shut it down. We’re the last
two. It’s over…</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: You’re lying. If it’s over, why are they
after me?</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Who sent you to Greece?</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: A voice. A voice from the States. Someone
new.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Pamela Landy?</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: I don’t know who that is.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: What’s going on in Berlin?</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: I don’t know! Why would I lie?</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: What the hell did you do? You must have
really screwed up.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: She really d id that? Told you not to kill
me? I had a woma n once. But after a while, what do you talk about? I
mean, for us. The work. Y ou can’t tell them who you are…</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: I thought you were here to kill me.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: How long? How long do I have –</p>
<p><strong>jar #3</strong>: – it’s a red flag file! – so fix it, call
them back ASAP! –</p>
<p><strong>jar #1</strong>: What? What’d they do?</p>
<p><strong>jar #3</strong>: She called Munich local.</p>
<p><strong>jar #2</strong>: It’s probably just a drill anyway.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: – car keys?</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: – my coat – but we should –</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: – what? –</p>
<p><strong>jarda</strong>: – take the back – get another car –</p>
<p><strong>147 ext./int. jarda’s kitchen – day</strong>: Seen from
inside, glimpsed through the glass outside.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: So he beats a man within an inch of his
life, strang les him, then blows the place up? For someone with amnesia,
he certainly hasn’t forgo tten how to kill, has he?</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: – hey! – they’ve got him boxed in! –</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: Forget it. They lost him.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: What’re you talking about? They’ve got a
three block perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: You can’t see him? He’s not in front of you?
Forget it. He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: It’s not gonna be like last time.</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: You better start listening to someone. Cause
we’ve been there.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Okay, enough… Take a walk, Danny. Get some
air.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: I don’t think we need to keep looking for him
anyway.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: And why is that?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Because he’s doing just what he said he’d do.
He’s coming for us.</p>
<p><strong>165 ext. hotel brecker – berlin – night – rain</strong>: It

NEEDLE-LIKE TOWER dominates the skyline, lights flashing through the
dark and wet –</p>
<p><strong>b167 ext. autobahn – night</strong>: Berlin 75 KM.</p>
<p><strong>pamela/phone</strong>: Hello –</p>
<p><strong>conklin</strong>: Neski. Vladimir Neski… He’s at the Hotel
Brecker. Get the papers. Say it.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Neski. Hotel Brecker. Papers.</p>

<p><strong>screen</strong>: Landy, Pamela 413.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Anything?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: No. Munich’s a bust. He’s loose.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Are we locked up?</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: I told everyone they had an hour – eat,
sleep, shave, whatever they want, but once we’re back, we’re back for
good.</p>
<p><strong>his pov</strong>: As they pile out of the van, start inside.
Acknowledged by a SECURITY DETAIL pretending to loiter outside. As we

<p><strong>pamela</strong>: – Munich to Berlin, check everything –

know.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Pamela Landy.</p>
<p><strong>bourne/phone</strong>: I was at the Westin this morning. I
could have killed you.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: It’s me.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Bourne?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I want to come in.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Okay, how do you want to do it?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I want someone I know to take me in.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: There was a girl in Paris. Part of the
program. She used to handle the medication.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: What if we can’t find her?</p>
<p><strong>bourne/phone</strong>: It’s easy. She’s standing right in
front of you.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Okay, Jason, your move.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Alexanderplatz. 30 minutes. Under the World
Clock. Alone. Give her your phone.</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: Here’s the clock – shit – he’s put her in the
middle of everything.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: – it’s a nightmare – we’ll never get her
covered.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Call a Mayday into Berlin station. We need
snipers, DOD, whatever they got.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Snipers? Hold on – he said he wants to come

<p><strong>abbott</strong>: My ass he do es. You’re pla ying with fire,
Pam ela. Mar shall said nail him to the wal l. I don ’t know how you
interpreted tha t, but I don’t think he meant rep atriate h im.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Don’t you want answers?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: There are no answers. Ther e’s either Jason
Bourne alive or Jason Bourne dead. And I for on e would prefer the
latter. And what abo ut her? You just sen d her out to th is lunatic
with no protectio n?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: What do you think? Is he coming in?</p>

<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Alright…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: …make the call. Get a wire on her. If it
starts to go wrong, take him out.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: They got the number. Bourne’s calls came from
Nevins’ phone. The field agent in Genoa.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Nevins is Bourne?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Are you an idiot?! Bourne must’ve cloned his
phone!</p>
<p><strong>in quick succession – nicky – binocular pov –

<p><strong>bourne</strong>: See that tram coming around the corner?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Get on it.</p>
<p><strong>k187 ext. alexanderplatz – day</strong>: The yellow TR AM

<p><strong>bourne’s voice</strong>: What the hell is she doing?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What’s she doing?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Why is she trying to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: They know! They know yo u were here. T hey
know you killed these two guys. The y know you and Conklin had something
on th e side. They don’t know w hat it is, but they know!</p>
<p><strong>delta v.o.</strong>: Where are they? Anyone?</p>
<p><strong>t187 int. pedestrian subway – day</strong>: Still walking.
BOURNE knowing he must be driving them nuts.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: How do they know that? How can they know any
of that?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What is this, a game?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I want to hear it from you.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Last week an Agency field officer went to
make a buy from a Russian national.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: A Russian?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: It was Pamela Landy’s op. The guy was goi ng
to sell-out a mole or something. I hav en’t been debriefed on exactly
what it was .</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Last week? When?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: And you got to him before we could.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I killed him???</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You left a p rint! There was Kel that did n’t
go of f! There was a partial print, the y tracked it back to Treadstone!
They kno w it’s yo u!</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I left a fingerprint! You fucking

<p><strong>pamela</strong>: That phone has a locator on it.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Why are you here, then?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Please – I’m only here because of Paris –
because they can’t figure out what you’re doing – I’m here because of
Abbott –</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Abbott?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: He closed down Treadstone – he took care of
me after Paris…</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: So when was I here?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: For Treadstone. In Berlin. You know my file.
I did a job here. When?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No. You never worked Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: My first job.</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Your first assignment was Geneva.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: That’s a lie!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: You never worked Berlin…</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: No…Jason…please…</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I was here!</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: … it’s not in the file…I swear…I kno w your

<p><strong>cronin</strong>: Got it, yeah . Hang on… Oka y, they’v e got
three guys out front and another two taking the back stairs. No word on
N icky.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Even if she’ s still got your phone, it might
take a while – signal’s hard to trace down t here.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: So what’s he doing? You believe him?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: It’s hard to swallow. The confusio n – the
amnesia – but he keeps on kil ling? It’s more calculated than sick. What
about N icky? She’s the last one to see Bourne i n Paris. She’s the one
he asks for. T hey disappear…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Well, whatev er he’s doing, I’ve had enough
– th is is now a search and destroy miss ion. I want the B erlin police
fully briefed and – – get this out to all the agencies.</p>

<p><strong>abbott</strong>: What do you have, Danny?</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: You put a fo ur-gam Kel on h ere and it’s gon

is if it’ s gonna b low the room wi th it.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: The re were t wo charges, they were supposed
to go off si multaneously. The second one, the one that didn’t go off,
was down her e… Fir st of all , this is nothi ng, it’s a sub- lin e for
the breaker above. Second, why put the char ge all the way down here? If
you ’re good enough to get i n here and han dle the g ear, you’re goo d
enough to kno w you don ’t need this. Bou rne would know.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: It was staged?</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: Is it a slam dunk? No, but…</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Jesus…</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: Oka y. What if someone decided to cover the ir
tracks by blaming Conklin and Bou rne. Wha t if Bourne didn’t have any
thing to do with this?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Keep going…</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: Something’s been going on here in Europe. And
it’s still going on. Post Conklin. Who’s been in Berlin?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Lots of people…</p>
<p><strong>zorn</strong>: Including Landy… She had access to the

<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Who else knows about this?</p>

<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Guten Abend.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: No. Sorry. I just got in… I – Is room 645
available? I stayed the re before. My wife and I.</p>
<p><strong>clerk</strong>: I’m sorry, that room is occupied. Would room

doing here?</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: Maybe he just needed a place to spend the

<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I want to look at the room. Check it
out.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: They missed him?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: So far. But they found Nicky. She’s back at

<p><strong>cronin</strong>: He went out the window in here…</p>

instead. Now they’re onto Nes ki. They’re at the Brecker Hotel even as
we speak.</p>
<p><strong>gretkov</strong>: Will it track back to us?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: No. The files are spotless. Whatever they
find, it’s just going to make Conklin look worse.</p>
<p><strong>gretkov</strong>: And the Landy woman?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: She’s done everything I wanted. She bit on
Conklin so fast it was laughable. She even found his bogus Swiss
account…</p>
<p><strong>gretkov</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: The re’s a bo dy in the basem ent. Dann y
Zor n. He’s got to disappea r. For go od. Cle an and fa st. I’ll put h
im in bed with Con klin and Bourne. Even t he girl, N icky. Giv e me
twen ty-four hours, I’ll think it up. But get the goddamn bo dy out of
the re.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Neski was a roadblock. Without me, there’s
no company, no fortune. You owe me, Uri. One last push.</p>
<p><strong>gretkov</strong>: One last push. One.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Mr. Abbott?</p>
<p><strong>248 int. lobby – hotel brecker – night</strong>: As PAMELA
and CRONIN exit the elevator, they are met by</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Here’s what I’ve got. Remember Vla dimir
Neski? R ussian politician? Seven years ag o, he was due to speak to a
group of Euro pean Oil ministers he re at the hotel . He never did. He
was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: By who?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: His wife. In room 645. Then she shot
herself.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Alright…I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on
Bourne, track everything that’s out there…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: And I want y ou to go through and cross
reference ou r buy that went bad, the Neskis, and Treadstone –</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: – they have to be related.</p>
<p><strong>251 int. berlin train station men’s room – night</strong>:
Bag slung – limping out – BOURNE has changed clothes. A big overcoat,
knit cap.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: We’ re lookin g at all Berlin outbound. Goo d
news is , every train s tation in Ber lin has t hirty to forty fixed,
digital sec urity cam eras. Common f eed.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Are we hacking or asking?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: Yes. In that order.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: And what about you, anything?</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: It’s starting to link up – the hijacked
money – the leak – Pecos Oil – one last bit is Treadstone.</p>
<p><strong>257 int. moscow train/passenger car – night</strong>:
CONDUCTORS moving quietly through the dark cars. Checking tickets and
visas and –</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: Does it look like he’s faking?</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: On the way in? Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: The leg’s definitely hurt.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: Well, there’ s no window in the men’s room,
folks, so le t’s find somebody coming out with a bad l eft leg.</p>
<p><strong>kurt</strong>: Maybe he’s still in there.</p>
<p><strong>teddy</strong>: I’ve got a limping guy, but it’s the right
leg.</p>
<p><strong>kim</strong>: Walking away, or walking toward you?</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: That’s him. It’s the coat! What train is
that?</p>
<p><strong>260 int. moscow train/passenger car – dawn</strong>: BOURNE –
asleep in his chair – rocked by the rhythm. But something wakes him
up.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: Hey…</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I wanted to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: But you found another choice.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: It wouldn’t have changed the way you
feel.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: It might have.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I know it’s a dream.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: I only dream about people who are dead.</p>
<p><strong>bourne</strong>: God, I miss you. I don’t know what to do
without you.</p>
<p><strong>marie</strong>: Jason. You know exactly what to do. That is
your mission now.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Sorry to wake you.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: I wasn’t sleeping. You OK?</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Yeah, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: What’s up?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Bunch of stuff.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: We tied the room Bourne visited tonight to a
murder/suicide seven years ago. A Russian couple, the Neskis.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Neski. The reformer. I remember that.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: He champione d the equal dis tribution of
oil leases i n the Caspian S ea. When he die d, they w ere all release d
to one pet roleum co mpany, Pecos Oi l. Guess wha t? – the CEO, Uri
Gretk ov, is ex-</p>
<p><strong>nicky</strong>: Someone was using Treadstone as a private
cleaning service.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Conklin… It’s – I’m sorry, Pamela. I guess
you were right all along.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: There’s something else.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: They found Danny Zorn’s body. Dead in the
basement at the building where my people got hit the first time.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Oh, God… It must have been Bourne.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Did he say anything to you?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: No… It must have been Bourne.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: We’ll know for sure when we get the security
tapes.</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: But we can relax. We tracked him. He’s on a
train to Moscow.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Moscow? What the Hell’s he going to Moscow
for?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Jesus… I, Zorn… I have to call his family.
Tell them…</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I’m sorry, Ward.</p>
<p><strong>gretkov</strong>: Da…</p>
<p><strong>abbott/phone</strong>: You didn’t stay, Uri.</p>
<p><strong>gretkov</strong>: This is not a clean phone.</p>
<p><strong>267 int. westin grand hotel lobby – dawn</strong>: Everyone
still here. CRONIN answering his cell phone – motioning to them, he’s
got news –</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: You’re sure?</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: What? The tapes?</p>
<p><strong>cronin</strong>: Hold on… Yep. And Ab bott just direct dialed
Moscow from his roo m…</p>
<p><strong>gretkov</strong>: Leaving was a business decision. We’re both
rich, come enjoy it.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>gretkov</strong>: Go to the airport. Get a plane. I’ll have a
brass band waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Save it for Bourne.</p>
<p><strong>gretkov</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: He left yest erday on the night train. He’s
probabl y just getting in now. You’ll have to hurry.</p>
<p><strong>gretkov</strong>: Bourne comes here? Why?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Open it.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: They go. You stay.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: Yes. Now…</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: I’d rather stand if it’s all the same to
you.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: I don’t exactly know what to say – I’m
sorry.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: ‘Why’ would be enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: I’m not a traitor. I’ve served my
country.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: And pocketed a fair amount of change while
doing it.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Why not? It was just money.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: And Danny Zorn, what was that?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Had to be done.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: No good options left?</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: In the end, honestly, it’s hubris. Sim ple
hubri s. You reach a point in this gam e when th e only satisfaction
left is to see how c lever you are.</p>
<p><strong>pamela</strong>: No. You lost your way.</p>
<p><strong>abbott</strong>: Well, you’re probably right. I guess that’s
all that hubris is.</p>
