<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Fuck! Fucking-shit-fuck-fucking-
fuck!</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Watch it, old man!</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: What the fuck? You’re doing it wrong.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: The needle is doing what the needle
does.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: What’s that supposed to mean?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 2.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo master</strong>: The irezumi does not hide the skin,
the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble
professions in the Book of Five Rings: the Warrior, the Artist, the
Merchant, and the farmer. If there is a conflict between the needle and
the skin, between the mark and the man, then perhaps the path you have
chosen is not the path for which you are suited.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: What did you just say, old man?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: I know you didn’t just disrespect me, did
you? You that fucking stupid? You disrespect me, and I’ll tattoo this
ceiling with your fucking brains!</p>
<p><strong>tattoo master</strong>: No disrespect.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: You’re lucky. I can’t kill you ’til you
finish this thing. Gimme that mirror! How’s it looking?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Not bad. Not bad. For an old fuck.</p>
<p><strong>yakuza one</strong>: Hey, boss. This just came for you.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 3.</p>
<p><strong>yakuza one</strong>: A letter.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: So open it, dumb ass.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: What? What is it?</p>
<p><strong>yakuza one</strong>: Looks like sand.</p>
<p><strong>yakuza one</strong>: Yup. Sand. Black Sand.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo master</strong>: No…</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: You know what this is?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Wanna let us in on the joke?</p>
<p><strong>tattoo master</strong>: Years ago, I watched a man open an
envelope like that one.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo master</strong>: There were many with him and they
laughed like you laugh now. Then it came from the shadows and their
laughter was drowned in blood. You cannot bargain with what is coming.
You cannot reason with it. Because it is not a human being. It is a
demon sent straight from hell that will never stop until you are
dead.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 4.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: What came out of the shadows?</p>
<p><strong>tattoo master</strong>: I cannot say the word.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: What word?</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: That night, one of their blades
struck here. I should have died, but for an accident of birth. My heart
is here, on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: What the fuck is that?</p>
<p><strong>yakuza one</strong>: Looks like a Ninja, boss.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: A ninja? Are you kidding me? That’s the
word you’re afraid to say? Ninja?</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Ninja-Ninja-Ninja!</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: You old fuck! You had me going! Ninja.
That’s some good shit.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 5.</p>
<p><strong>hollywood</strong>: Listen… you don’t have to do this!
Whatever you’re getting paid, I’ll triple it! You hear me! I’ll pay you
whatever you want! Just name your price!</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: But you are real, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: For fifty-seven-years, I’ve told your
story…</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 6.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: No one ever believed me.</p>
<p><strong>tattoo artist</strong>: But you are real, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>checker</strong>: That’s a lot of noodles. Are you a student?
Tourist? Here on business?</p>
<p><strong>checker</strong>: When was the last time someone cooked you a
real meal? I get off at seven.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 7.</p>
<p><strong>checker</strong>: You could come by, let me make you a proper
dinner!</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I don’t think so. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>checker</strong>: So if you’re not a student, and you’re not
a tourist, and you’re not here to work… what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Waiting.</p>
<p><strong>checker</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: For the wheel to turn.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Wherever you are, wherever you may go….</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: …you must never, ever forget who you are, how
you came to be. You are Ozunu. You are a part of me as I am a part of
you.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 8.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: This is the truth of your lives and it will
remain true after death.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: This is my new son. I have given him the name
Raizo. Welcome him as your brother.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: What’s all this for the Delgata case?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: No. This is Delgata-</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: And the rest?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …evidence.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: For?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Oh no. Not again.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You said you’d take it serious when I had
serious evidence.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 8A.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Does that evidence include photos of the
Loch Ness monster as well?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You’ve trusted my research before, what’s the
problem now Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: What’s the problem? Come on Mika, it’s like
one of those questions on an IQ test, which of these doesn’t belong;
laptops, space shuttles, nanotechnology, ninjas.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: All I’m asking for is an hour. That’s all.
Give me an hour and if you still think I’m chasing UFO’s, I’ll walk out
and you’ll never hear another thing about them.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Why do I think I’m going to regret this?</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Oh, Mr. Nan, good, you’re back.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: We had a heating problem, and I had to go
into your apartment.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Is everything all right?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 8B.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: Yes, fine, it’s all fixed. You keep it
very dark and spare in there.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Ms. Ali, my privacy is very important to me.
If you enter my apartment again without my permission, I will leave your
building.</p>
<p><strong>landlady</strong>: I just –</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 9.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Good day.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You should have died.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: On the street. Abandoned by your parents.
Without a home. Without people to care for you. You should have done as
most children do, and gone quietly from this world, to the next. But,
instead you fought. As you did here today. You fought. And you won.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Scars are the calligraphy of violence, Raizo.
They inscribe the story of one’s life.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 10.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You survived because you are different. You
are special. That is why you are here. That is why the Great Current,
which flows beneath all life, carried you to me.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: It’s a pattern, like the currents of the
ocean.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Some people see money as the root of all evil,
but to me it looks like a fingerprint. Whether we’re talking about 19th
century Korea, or 21st century Iraq, the game is the same. If you want
to understand why certain things are happening, you have to understand
the flow of money.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: You’re excited, Mika. You know I get nervous
when you’re excited.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You remember the Eulmi incident?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 11.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Korean queen, late eighteen- hundred’s.
According to you, she was off’d by one of these ninja clans.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Ozunu. I think. I’ve been going through some
of the original transcripts of the trial of Kunitomo Shigeaki. The
prosecutor questioned him about a payment of 100 pounds of gold.
Shigeaki answered that he didn’t know what the prosecutor was talking
about. The question was never brought up again. But what pinged for me
was the amount- the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the Hattori
Clan for the assassination of Lord Sanda.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: So you start to wonder, in this ever
changing world, if the cost of a man’s life has remained constant.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Exactly. I figure these clans are like a
thousand years old. They probably don’t change a lot.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I started looking at international wire
transfers, targeting banks in the regions of several high- profile
assassinations and bingo-</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Minister Zhang. The day before the
assassination $1,555,999.90 was transferred from the bank of Shanghai.
The exact market value of one hundred pounds of gold.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Highly circumstantial.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 12.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I thought you might say that so I checked how
often this particular bank transferred that market equivalent to a
hundred pounds of gold in the last three years.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Let me guess.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Not once.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Okay you got me. This is interesting.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: The clans are real, Ryan. They steal children
and turn them into assassins. They’ve been doing it for years and
nobody’s doing a damn thing to stop them.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Look, no one’s denying the historical
record, Mika. But the whole idea just doesn’t fit in with a modern
world. It’s like one of those questions on an IQ test: which of these
doesn’t belong in this sentence: laptops, space shuttles,
nanotechnology, ninjas.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: They’re real Ryan. You can call them spooks,
or assassins, or whatever you want if it makes you feel better, but
they’re out there. They’re killing people and nobody is doing a damn
thing to stop them.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 13.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Our enemies are everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You must move without trace or footprint.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You must become shadow; Your scent nothing
but wind through trees.</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: Hi… excuse me…? Would you mind?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: …sorry?</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: If it’s not too much trouble, could
you help me with this?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 13A.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: What clan are you from?</p>
<p><strong>pretty woman</strong>: I… don’t understand…</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You came alone. The Ozunu clan would never
make such a mistake.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 14.</p>
<p><strong>manager</strong>: What is going on-</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: And two cokes, please.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: How long have you been here? And you can’t say
“zwei cola bitte”?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Course I can, but you tend to hear more
interesting things if people don’t know you can understand what they’re
saying.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Do you ever stop being a cop?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Not the way I was raised. My dad always
said, being a cop has nothing to do with a clock. It’s a consequence of
consciousness often interpreted as desire.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 15.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Desire?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: For justice. And doughnuts.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: So you got something else?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I think so. Same template as before. The
transfer was made the day before a multiple homicide in Osaka. The
police and newspapers are calling it a gangland slaying.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: How do you know what the police report says?
You’re not still requisitioning evidence with my clearance codes, are
you?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What about the bank audit?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Denied. It was a long shot at best.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: But you said you found something.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: A report. A friend of mine in Moscow, tipped
me to it.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: It was written during the height of the Cold
War by a high ranking KGB agent named Aleksei Sabatin. In it, he raises
the possibility that several political assassinations were conducted by
an ancient but very sophisticated network he calls the Nine Clans.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 16.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Mind you, he doesn’t call them ninjas.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What happened to him?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Same thing that’s going to happen to me, if
I keep hanging around with you- booted out of the service for mental
instability.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Is he still alive? We need to find him.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Working on it.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You believe it now, don’t you?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Ninjas? Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Then why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: No idea-</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: But I can guarantee you that it has nothing
to do with the fact that you’re the most attractive researcher that I’ve
ever worked with.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 17.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: The body must obey the will.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Hunger and thirst, your bowels and breath,
even the blood in your veins, are the body’s weaknesses.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Master them, and you master the self.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: This is the power of the Ozunu clan.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: This is the way of the ninja.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Eat tonight and you work twice as hard
tomorrow.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 18.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: The world feeds on the weak.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Suffering exists only because weakness
exists.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You must hate all weakness. Hate it in
others, but most of hate it in yourself.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 18A.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 19.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 20.</p>
<p><strong>sabatin</strong>: Historical evidence suggests that
Ibn-Battuta’s journey through the far east brought him into contact with
what might be one of the oldest of the Nine Clans. He travels with a
group of orphans that are being taken from a city devastated by war to
the Shido of the Ozunu clan. The people of the surrounding province
refer to the Shido as “The Orphanage.”</p>
<p><strong>sabatin</strong>: Battuta describes a ceremonial dinner
followed by a display of martial skill. The combatants were children
neither beyond the age of ten.</p>
<p><strong>sabatin</strong>: His host explains that a man’s life must be
made meaningless compared to the life of the Clan. Own the meaning of a
man’s life and you own his heart.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 21.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 22.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …who are you?</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Strength is the only virtue that nature
respects.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Hone your body. Sharpen your mind. Become the
weapon you will need to survive.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You shouldn’t do that. It’s against the
rules. If they catch you –</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Then they catch me.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: They’ll put you in the box.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Yes, they will.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: I believe the heart of the tree knows which
way it needs to grow.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Trees don’t have hearts.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Everything has a heart.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 23.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Really? Let me see.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Hello….hello, you in there.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: It’s saying hello back. And that it’s happy
to meet me…but it misses you.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Liar.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Listen to mine, I’m not lying. I’ll prove
it.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 24.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Excuse me? Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Where’s Jona?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Jona. The usual cleaner. Jona.</p>
<p><strong>asian man</strong>: Ahh, Jona. Jona sick.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Oh. Well, tell him I hope he feels better</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 25.</p>
<p><strong>asian man</strong>: Take care. You should take care.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …What?</p>
<p><strong>asian man</strong>: Work so late. Not good for you.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: True…Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …is someone there?</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Did Takeshi’s blow hurt you? You think this
is pain? You are mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: That is true pain. You must learn to live
with it.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 27.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: This is your first test. Survive the
night.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Very good, Raizo. Very good.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 28.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Last night I’m working late and I get a
visit. Guy named Zabranski. Works upstairs for Internal Affairs. Just
drops by. In the neighborhood- cup a sugar- how ya doin- kinda thing.
Asks what I’m working on. Oh, this and that, usual blibbity blab, I tell
him. Then he smiles and says-</p>
<p><strong>zabranski</strong>: …Very Good.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I don’t understand what is really going on,
but I’m smart enough to recognize a warning when I see one.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: But why?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Why? It’s obvious. If your little fantasy
has even slightest chance of being real, then these Nine Clans would
have some pretty major juice protecting them.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: We are going to tip-toe, very carefully from
here on out. You understand? You don’t do anything else without checking
with me. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Did you find Sabatin yet?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 29.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You did.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Yeah…he’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: They killed him.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: People die of heart attacks, Mika.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Was he married? Did he have a family?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: God, you are relentless, aren’t you.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I know you Ryan, you would have checked.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: A wife.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Still in Russia?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Relocated.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Explain something to me first. Where is this
obsession coming from? What started this whole thing?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 30.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Like your father said…It’s a consequence of
consciousness often interpreted as desire.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Desire for what?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: For the truth.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Potsdam. She’s in Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Mika! Tip-toe!</p>

<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: These next five years will be the most
important of your training.</p>
<p><strong>mr. ozunu</strong>: For an entire year, you shall live
without one of your senses, beginning with the sense you rely on the
most: your sight.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: A true Shinobi lives in darkness. The night
is his weapon.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You must see with more than your eyes.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 32.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Mrs. Sabatin?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: Ja.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I’m with Europol. We spoke on the phone.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 33.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: Ah, sehr gut. Bitte…please.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Shoen.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: You said you read my husband’s report,
yes? What did you think?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I found it…illuminating. Especially the
references to the Rihla. Your husband quotes passages not found in
Battuta’s present manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: My husband journeyed all over the
world researching that report, but when he was home, he never spoke
about it. He said it was safer that way.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I understand the report caused some problems
for him inside the</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: The report caused “problems” for
Alexei’s career the way Moses caused problems for the Pharaoh, you see?
Very unpleasant. Terrible people saying terrible things.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 34.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: After he retired…was asked to
retire…we moved, first to Byelorussia and then here to Berlin when the
wall came down. He said this will be a good place to grow old together.
And it was, for a time.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: About two years ago…two? Yes, after
the assassination of Zhukov, the report drew attention. After that,
everything was different.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: Alexei hired men to change all the
locks, and put in more of them. Locks on the windows, locks on the
doors, locks on the locks. He put in cameras and motion sensors and
lights…everywhere, lights.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: “There can be no shadows,” he said.
“No shadows.”</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: I will tell you a true thing, and a
hard thing. My husband was a soldier. A member of Russian intelligence.
He had seen many terrible things…. He was not a man to frighten
easily.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 35.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: But from that day on, when the sun
went down behind the hills…in his eyes, I saw the fear a child has of
the dark. Then, one day, a man came to the door.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: They talked in Alexei’s study for
sometime. Then the young man left.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: It was unlike Alexei not to see him
out. I remember being very scared. But when I opened the door, he was
just sitting there. For a moment, he didn’t even notice me. Then he
stood up and kissed me and told me that he loved me very much. He said I
should always remember that.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Do you know what they talked about?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: No. Alexei never spoke about it. But
two months later, he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Can I ask how he died?</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: The lights went out.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: You are the first person who has taken
my husband’s work seriously. It would be good to know that he did not
die without cause. Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>mrs. sabatin</strong>: He would want you to have this.</p>

<p><strong>maslow</strong>: You lied to me.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What’re you –</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I told you to stop using my confirmation
code.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I did –</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Dammit, Mika –</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 39.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …I’m sorry, it was the only way I could get
the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Shit….</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: What happened? Everything’s fucking
happened.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: When you were slapping my code all over town
like some phone number in a bathroom, did you happen to notice the
classification code on the cases you were digging through?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: What did it say?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: DNP.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: That’s right. DNP. DO NOT</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Actually that would be DNFP –</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Right now there are people from internal
affairs, CIA, Homeland Security and for all I know the Martian Fucking
Military in my office tearing the place apart.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 40.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I don’t know what they’re looking for but I
think you do.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Most of this is from Sabatin. Copies of what I
think are the lost chapters of the Rihle. I think it describes the
original location of the Ozunu Clan but my 14th century Arabic is a
little rusty.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: And this?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: That’s how it started. I made a mistake, mixed
up the case code and they sent me that.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: …Christ.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Yeah. I know. I don’t understand why they’re
fighting though. It could be a clan war.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: So you requisitioned this by accident. You
used my code which is why you didn’t want to show me this. Which is also
why they’re tearing apart my office right now.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I’m sorry Ryan. You have to know I didn’t mean
for you to get in trouble…</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 41.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I just thought if this was real, if these
clans were killing people, you know, it was our job to try to stop
them.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Isn’t that what your dad would do?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Okay, that’s low.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Look, I know I broke the rules. I’ll explain
what I did and accept the consequences.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Very noble of you but I’ve got the feeling
this isn’t a slap-on-the wrist kinda consequence. Let me take this and
try to make some sense of this shitstorm you started. In the meantime,
you will not say anything to anybody. Capiche?</p>
<p><strong>passport official</strong>: Are you coming to Berlin for
business or pleasure Mr. Han</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Pleasure.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 42.</p>
<p><strong>zabranski</strong>: Boy you’re like a dog with a bone on that
computer aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Excuse me? Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>zabranski</strong>: Agent Zabranski. Internal affairs. Need
to ask you a couple of questions. You are Mika Coretti, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>zabranski</strong>: Forensic researcher. You work a lot with
an Agent…Maslow. That right?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …A few cases.</p>
<p><strong>zabranski</strong>: You have something of a social
relationship.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>zabranski</strong>: You had lunch with him on the 13th and
again on the 18th.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>zabranski</strong>: Is it not true?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I…I’m not sure. We do have lunch together
sometimes, usually when we’re working-</p>
<p><strong>zabranski</strong>: Are you working on something with him
right now?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 43.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: No…not right now.</p>
<p><strong>zabranski</strong>: Has Agent Maslow seemed different lately,
in any way? Has he done or said anything that struck you as unusual?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: No why. Has Agent Maslow done something?</p>
<p><strong>zabranski</strong>: Just routine. The agency cares about its
field operatives. We monitor for signs of stress, fatigue, mental
exhaustion. Agent Maslow has a serious case load. That much work can
wear on a man.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: This is Ryan Maslow. Leave a number-</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Come on…you’re kidding me.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 44.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Ssssshhhhhh. Sorry, Mika.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Fucking Christ, Ryan-</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I couldn’t talk earlier. They’re watching
me.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Zabranski came to my office. Asking about
you.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I know how Sabatin must have felt.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I showed Jamison the materials.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>jamison</strong>: This agency is subject to the International
laws and agreements that govern the jurisdiction of our authority. If a
case is marked DNP we must respect the jurisprudence of the regional
government and act accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I understand that sir but-</p>
<p><strong>jamison</strong>: Let me be clear, Agent Maslow. In the eyes
of the law these materials do not exist. If so, than there is no case
and if there is no case there is no reason for this conversation to
continue.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: He took the materials?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Come on Mika, how could he take something
that didn’t exist? He couldn’t. Which means that I couldn’t copy it
either, and if I couldn’t copy it than I can’t be violating
international laws and agreements by still having it.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What are we going to do?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Your going to go home. Pack your bags and go
on holiday.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: No way-</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Don’t fucking argue with me, Mika. I trusted
you. Now you’ve got to trust me.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Ryan, I can’t let you lose your job because of
me-</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I’m not talking about my job, Mika.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Take this. It’s clean, no serial number.
Untraceable.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I’ve never even fired one of these.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: This is the bad end. This is the end you
hold. Point, shoot, run like hell.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 46.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I’m going to try to find some help. Until
then, I need you gone. Don’t tell anyone where you’re going, just go.
Use this phone to text me when you get there, or if you have any
problems.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Ryan…</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I know. It’s unbelievable. I’ve
investigated, world bank officials, drug cartels, arms dealers, and I’ve
never faced this kind of heat. For ninjas. Fucking unbelievable!</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Hey….</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Power’s out. Us, the building behind us,
that one across the street. Seems like every few months, boom, the
lights out. I call, I complain, they listen…nothing gets done. So I sit
out here, at least it’s cool.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 47.</p>
<p><strong>neighbor</strong>: Watch your step.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You’re not the first person to give me that
advice today….</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 48.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You know me?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …security camera in New York. Recorded you
fighting…one of them.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You know about them?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: A little.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 48A.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Uhh– Well, there are these clans…we’re not
sure how many.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Nine.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Okay. Nine. Nine clans. And they apparently
have been supplying assassins to governments or anyone who happens to
have one hundred pounds of gold lying around for the last thousand
years. Give or take.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: His name was Jin.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You knew him?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: He was not born an “Assassin”.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …you’re from his clan ?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Then…why did you stop him?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: The clans have three kinds of people! People
with power. People with money. Or people hunting them.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 49.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: They’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: The Hanta-Kirra.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Does that mean what I think it means?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: They won’t stop until you are dead.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Oh god.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: The gun won’t help you.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I don’t have a lot of options okay. I once
took a Tae Bo class, but that’s the extent of my Kung Fu abilities.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I can help but you must tell me something
first.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You saw Ms. Sabatin.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I’ve been watching you, waiting for them.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 50.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Did she give you something?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You have them?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: But I can get them.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: We need something black. Hurry!</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Follow me. Step where I step.</p>

<p><strong>takeshi</strong>: Raizo.</p>
<p><strong>dog ninja</strong>: He’s taken the girl.</p>

<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Betrayal begets blood.</p>
<p><strong>back to:</strong>: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 52.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: This is the law of the Nine Clans. This is
the way of the ninja.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I’m going to have to make a phone call in
order to get the manuscript.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Not now. Just drive.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Does not matter. Just get as far away from
here as fast as you can without drawing attention.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You think they’re following us?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I know they’re following us.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 53.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I don’t see anything back there.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: They have our scent.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Following our scent? Like dogs?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: No. Like Wolves.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: How do you know so much about them?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I was one of them.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You flunked out of ninja school or
something?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: …something.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You may remove the blindfold.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Your entire life has brought you to this
moment. Do not fail yourself. Do not fail your family.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 54.</p>
<p><strong>mr. ozunu</strong>: He is wearing a black and gold watch.
Bring it to me.</p>
<p><strong>kingpin</strong>: Wait here. Gotta piss.</p>

kind of secret faggot?</p>

fuck me up, boy.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 56.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Keep it. It will remind you that every minute
of your life is a gift that I have given you.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You have made me proud tonight, Raizo. There
are some who believed you would fail, but I knew you would not.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You have a strength inside you Raizo. You
must use that strength, now to show me that you are truly Ozunu.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Weakness compels strength. Betrayal begets
blood.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: A daughter that turned her back on her
family. She tried to run. Takeshi hunted her down.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: It is the law of the Nine Clans.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 57.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Kill him!</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Okay, if you’re not going to say anything, do
you mind if I talk? When I get nervous, it helps if I talk.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: My name is Mika by the way.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I know.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 58.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Yeah, well usually if someone introduces
themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Raizo…is the name I was given.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: So, you were an orphan?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Interesting nature verses nurture case study I
imagine.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: If it’s okay with you, I’ll try to fill in
some of the blanks. You must have been taken by the Ozunu clan, trained
to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of
the program. I don’t imagine this went over so well and since they’re
after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in
a major way. But you are also after them or you wouldn’t have bothered
going to Sabatin. Which I figure means you’re searching for the location
of The Orphanage because that’s obviously the only information Battatu’s
book would have that you wouldn’t already know.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Yeah, I got some moves too. I’m pretty lethal
with the research thing.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 59.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: But here’s a question I can’t answer: since
you didn’t know I went to Sabatin’s, why did you save me?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Ninja only kill two kinds of people. The
first kind has power and money. The other kind is trying to stop
them.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Exit here.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I understand retail therapy as well as any
girl but I think it’s a little late.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You are a size 36?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What? No! Size 34…`cept certain times of the
month.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: If you leave while I am gone they will catch
you and kill you.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Do you understand that?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 60.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: We need a hotel.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Get undressed. Shower. Do not use the hotel
soap. Or any towel. Do you smoke?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Put your clothes in here.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 61.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Hey-</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Don’t you know how to knock?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I’m trying to save your life.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …okay right.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Dry yourself with this.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …I’m just a researcher. I’m really not
equipped to deal with this…</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Get dressed.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: These are a little tight.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You said 34.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: European sizes…run a little small I guess.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 62.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: This is for my “scent”?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Wow. They teach you that at ninja school?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Most locks are not worth the metal they’re
made of.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You’re going to steal a car?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Just borrow it.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Get in.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: In for a penny, in for a pounding.</p>

engineering.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Now we have some time.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 63.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: How much time?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: A day. Maybe less.</p>

hours!</p>

<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Trouble? You miss jury duty you’re in
trouble. You’re in some kind of bottomless pit of deep shit.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Yeah. Least I’m not down here by myself…</p>

the tape?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: He’s on our side, Ryan. I trust him.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Careful, Mika.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I promised him the Battuta pages. Do you still
have them?</p>

<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Why have you done this?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Done what?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Step back Mika.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: People will die.</p>

<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Something’s wrong with the infrared cam.</p>
<p><strong>security goon</strong>: No sir, we checked it.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Then why isn’t he showing up?</p>
<p><strong>security goon</strong>: We think he’s able to lower the
temperature of his body to remain neutral.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Or maybe he’s just cold-blooded.</p>

<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 66A.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Ryan, you know this is wrong! It can’t be
legal! What is this place? Your own private Guantanamo?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: It’s an old GDR safehouse. Jamison wants
this off the grid.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Ryan you’re making a huge mistake!</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I don’t think so. We got reports from
Washington, London, Osaka all tagging your boy. Only problem we have is
where to extradite him first.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: So two weeks ago, there’s no such thing as a
ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: We must respect the jurisprudence of the
regional government and corresponding law enforcement agencies.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: He’s not the enemy.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: No? You ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome I’m
getting the feeling I’m looking at a pretty serious case of it.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I’m not crazy. This is!</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 67.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: He’s a killer, Mika. Weren’t you the one
telling me it was our job to stop him.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You’re not listening to me!</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: You’re not saying anything worth hearing.
Look, if want to do the insubordination tango, let’s go, but not in
front of the kids okay? Boys, give us a minute.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Damn it, Ryan, I –</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Listen to me, we don’t have much time. Look,
I don’t know what you’ve stumbled into, but somebody is pulling some
major strings inside.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: They want him dead. He’s been fighting them
for years.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I believe you. I believe you. I’ve been in
this business too long not to smell a set-up. But we have to be careful
how we handle this. And I can’t risk you going AWOL on me again, because
– – because I don’t want anything to happen to you.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 68.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: If trouble comes, turn this on, no matter
where, and I’ll find you.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You shouldn’t do that they’ll catch you.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Then they’ll catch me.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: They’ll put you in the box.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Yes. They will.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I told you. I tried to warn you.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 69.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: …yes, you did….</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: But you did it anyway. Why?</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Why am I in here for watering my tree…or why
are you out there… watering me?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Could you give us a moment?</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Negative. Not safe ma’am.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: If he wanted to hurt me he could have done
that a while ago.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Sorry ma’am. Maslow okayed the water. That’s
it.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Hi…you looked thirsty.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I’m sorry…I didn’t know about this.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You do?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 70.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: The only time you lied to me was when you
told me your size.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Your heart. It is special.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You know about my heart?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Hearts speak truer than tongues.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Listen, Maslow is on our side. He’s going to
try to help you.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: It’s too late. All that matters is the Rihla.
Get the manuscript before they get here.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: The Hanta Kirra?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Hurry.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Ryan, can I talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: We have to do this again, Coretti?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: No sir. I just…I have reason to believe that a
group of ninja may be on their way here.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 71.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I think these gentlemen can handle a few
whack-jobs wearing pajamas. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: See?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: But the situation we discussed-</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I’m working on that. You have to give me a
little time.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: We don’t have time.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: They’re not here now.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: They’ll be here soon.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: How soon-</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Raizo–</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Mika!</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 71A.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Go with her! Secure the prisoner!</p>
<p><strong>europol water guard</strong>: Hold your fire–</p>
<p><strong>europol guard</strong>: Christ–</p>
<p><strong>europol water guard</strong>: Good way to get yourself
killed, Agent Coretti.</p>
<p><strong>europol #2</strong>: What the fuck’s with the lights?</p>
<p><strong>europol guard</strong>: We got some guys in pajamas comin’ to
play spin the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>europol #2</strong>: Huh huh. I got something they can wrap
their lips around.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I don’t have time for this shit. We have to
move the prisoner.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Mika!</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 71B.</p>
<p><strong>europol water guard</strong>: No ma’am. Those aren’t our
orders.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You’ve got to get out of here!</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Not without you.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Then we all die together.</p>
<p><strong>europol agent 2</strong>: Don’t see shit–</p>
<p><strong>point man</strong>: Is that..?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Fuck me…</p>
<p><strong>europol #2</strong>: What the fu–</p>
<p><strong>europol guard</strong>: They’re not showing up on IR!</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Come on–come on–</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Mika?</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 71D.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Shh!</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I don’t want to sound critical–</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Got it!</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Go. Find Maslow.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Go quick.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Mika!</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 71E.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Jesus Ryan–</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I thought you were–</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Are you ok?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: I hope that wasn’t my liver. Gonna need that
soon.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 72-73.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Fuck!</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 74.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: The manuscript–</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: No Mika–</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Right…</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Two minutes. Keep it in gear.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Maslow–</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Tip-toe.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 75.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Come on, Ryan…</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Hurry the fuck up!</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Motherfuckfuckfuck–</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 76.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Ryan- I had to leave!</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Good, stay clear.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Do you have the map?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Not yet. We’re heading upstairs now.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Where’s Raizo</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 77.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: He took off. We think they went after
him.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 78.</p>
<p><strong>takeshi</strong>: This is the end for you, brother.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Raizo!</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: What were you doing in the street?!</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: …waiting for you…</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You have to go to a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: No. Not a hospital. Another place.</p>
<p><strong>herbalist</strong>: What is it? What –</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: …dong-xia leaves…three of the lo-chan…dragon
root…</p>
<p><strong>herbalist</strong>: You should not mix these. Very
dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>herbalist</strong>: If you are in pain…if you wish to
die…there are other ways, this will be agony –</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: No…it will save me….</p>
<p><strong>herbalist</strong>: It will? You’re sure? Let me write this
down.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Hot water.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I have to sleep now…a day at least.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: A day?!? What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: …keep moving…</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 80.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I’ll have him to go. Can you…help me to the
car?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Mika, where are you?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Moving. He told me to keep moving.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: He’s still alive?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: After a fashion.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Let us bring you in.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Not this time.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Mika, the situation’s a little different.
Jurisprudence goes out the fucking window when my men get attacked.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 81.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Do you have the manuscript?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: …negative. They got to my office.
Everything’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Mika, it’s gonna be all right. We’ll find
them.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …but I promised…</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: We’ll keep your promise. They’re too many
people involved now. It’s just a matter of time.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I don’t think we have much time…</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Just tell me where you are.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Mika? Mika? Dammit.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 82.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I know you can’t hear me, so I’m sure this
doesn’t matter, but I’m going to say it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I’m a forensic researcher, okay? That’s like a
fancy way of saying I’m a librarian. By myself I can’t do anything to
help you.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: I wanted to think you for saving my life.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: And I hope you can forgive me for this.</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Agent Maslow, the tracking device–</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: You’ve got a lock?</p>
<p><strong>aide</strong>: Triangulating her position now.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 83.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: They took him. Ten minutes ago. He’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: …no!</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Kiriko! You can’t leave!</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: I have to.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 84.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Because my heart is telling me too.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: The Hanta Kirra will come for you.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Then they will come.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You know the law. He will cut your heart from
your chest.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: No…He can never touch my heart.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Come with me.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Where? What is out there?</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Life.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: …My life is here.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Because I can’t watch you become something
you are not.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: We have been betrayed.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: A child of mine, my daughter, betrayed us.
She refused these gifts. Rejected our clan.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 85.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Hers is a shame that can only be purged with
blood.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You who returned her shall have this
honor.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You are Ozunu. Your life is meaningless
compared to the survival of the Clan. This is our deepest truth. Because
of it, we have endured for hundreds of years, and will endure for
hundreds more.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 86.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Weakness compels strength. Betrayal begets
blood. This is the way of the Nine Clans. This is the way of the
Ninja.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: I have waited many years for this moment. I
have dreamed it, many times.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You will suffer for seven days, one day for
each year you defied me.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: For seven days, we will…take…from you, as I
have just done. Everyone here will take from you. Piece by piece. You
will live through it all, you will feel through it all. You will watch
as the birds fight over the pieces.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You will know pain like no other human being
has ever known.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 87.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Your death will be remembered for a thousand
years as a testament to the will and strength of the Ozunu Clan.</p>
<p><strong>takeshi</strong>: Father…</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 88.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: No more grenades, not until we get the
children out!</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: What took you?</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: You knew I’d come?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Just because I was asleep doesn’t mean I
couldn’t hear you.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: And I forgive you.</p>
<p><strong>takeshi</strong>: Come, little brother, let us play like old
times</p>
<p><strong>takeshi</strong>: No death tasted as sweet as hers.</p>
<p><strong>takeshi</strong>: I watched you die when I pierced her heart.
You have always been too weak to be Ozunu.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 90.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: You have not forgotten your training. You
will always be mine, child.</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Perhaps this is the best way for you to
die.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: The breath I take after you are dead, will be
the first of my life.</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 91.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Die you fuck!</p>
<p><strong>ozunu</strong>: Bitch!</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Raizo</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 92.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Mika! Run!</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Where is he? I can’t see him!</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Get away!</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 93.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Mika!</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: She saved my life.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: She will be all right.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: How can you be sure?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: Her heart is special.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: Medic! Over here now!</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: Is she going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>medic</strong>: I don’t know…she’s got a hole right through
the middle of her heart…but shes not really bleeding, that badly…</p>
<p>****: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 94.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: My heart…</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …is over here.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: …you gotta be fucking kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>mika</strong>: …Raizo?</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: He said you saved his life.</p>
<p><strong>maslow</strong>: So you kept your promise. Can we go home
now?</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: You shouldn’t do that.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: I believe the heart of a tree knows which
way it needs to grow.</p>
<p>****: Trees don’t have hearts.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Everything has a heart.</p>
<p><strong>raizo</strong>: I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>cut to:</strong>: GOLDENROD REVISED 2nd DRAFT 6/4/08 95.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Hello…hello in there. It said it was happy
to meet me and that it missed you.</p>
<p><strong>kiriko</strong>: Come with me!</p>
