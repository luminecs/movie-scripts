<h1 id="bodyguard">bodyguard</h1>
<p><strong>screen is black</strong>: In the darkness we hear dripping
water, the echoing approach of two sets of footsteps. There is the sound
of a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies. THREE BOOMING
GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from another. So fast and close, they’re
barely distinguish- able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete
walls and dies away. Silence.</p>
<p><strong>frank farmer’s face -</strong>: mid to late 30s, peers
intently over a smoking gun. He is The Bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>angle - hit man</strong>: dead on his feet, leans against a
car. A gun drops heavily from his hand. His life ebbs as he slides
slowly down the car door to his knees then falls forward, face down on
the cement floor. A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of
KLINGMAN. Protectively pressed body to body on the filthy cement floor
of the garage. Klingman, a handsome, 50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in
barely controlled fear as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil.
There is no movement. The two men are lying near the right front fender
of a black limousine. Blood spreads from the body of the hit man, a few
yards away. Klingman starts to raise himself up but Farmer keeps him
pressed to the floor, still alert for any further threat.</p>
<p><strong>main titles begin.</strong>: A beat, and VOICES are heard
O.S. Farmer wheels, snub- nosed .357 aimed at them.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p><strong>angle - doorway to garage</strong>: A uniformed chauffeur
freezes in his tracks. Farmer lowers his weapon and speaks.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Call 911.</p>
<p><strong>2a int. dan’s apartment - desk top - night 2a</strong>: A
battered old desk. Scattered across the top – a pile of blank white
paper, a jar of glue, a stack of magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV
remote control, softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we
saw in the store window, the same song. Hands appear. Male hands. They
open a drawer and remove a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully
they put the gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound.
The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars. They put the
magazine down and pick up the scissors. A headline on the cover reads:
“RACHEL MARRON’S GREATEST TRIUMPH!” The scissors start to cut.
Meticulously they excise the name “RACHEL MARRON” from the page. With
the care of a surgeon.</p>
<p><strong>3 ext. hollywood premiere - night 3</strong>: A tumultuous
crash of screaming, pushing bodies. Arms stretch out, cameras flash,
sunguns flare, microphones are thrust forward. A deafening cacophony of
“Rachel! Rachel! Rachel! Over here! Over here! This way, Rachel! Rachel!
Rachel!” We cannot see the object of this frenzy. We catch a brief
glimpse of an attractive, well-dressed young woman , exiting with the
other celebrities, as she is pushed and casually jostled aside by the
mass of surging fans and media. Her face is calm and impassive as she
watches from the sidelines.</p>
<p><strong>5 int. klingman’s office den - night 5</strong>: In a paneled
room tastefully hung with a few choice paint- ings that reflect
Klingman’s success as an arbitrageur, he pours two snifters of brandy as
he speaks with Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>klingman</strong>: Your hands ever shake, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sometimes. It’s just adrenaline.</p>
<p><strong>klingman</strong>: … How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I saw him washing the car.</p>
<p><strong>klingman</strong>: I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They don’t wash cars on the parking
levels.</p>
<p><strong>klingman</strong>: You know, I’d like you to stay on.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m not good in permanent positions, my feet
go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>6 int. darkened room - desk top - night 6</strong>: The
rubber-gloved hands are glueing the word “TIME” onto a message that is
taking the classic form of a ransom note. Each word has been cut from a
different page and is in a different typeface. The note is being
assembled with such care that it has an unusually neat appearance and is
quite easy to read. It reads:</p>
<p><strong>7 ext. charity concert - evening 7</strong>: A blur of hands
and faces. Excited fans. Pieces of paper, autograph books, notes are
thrust forward INTO the CAMERA. Again, a mass chanting “Rachel! Rachel!
Rachel!” Hands of Rachel’s entourage accept some of the proffered items.
In CLOSEUP, we see Rachel’s hands signing “Best wishes,</p>
<p><strong>10 int. farmer’s kitchen - night 10</strong>: Farmer has
carefully set a place for himself at the table in a breakfast nook. A
bottle of red wine is open with a glass beside it. At the stove he stirs
and flavors a Boeuf Bourgignon and reads a Time magazine. He adds a
splash of wine. He lifts the pot from the stove and tries a piece of
meat. At the table, he looks at the place setting and absently eats
another piece of meat. Finally he sets the pot on the plate and eats
from it directly while glancing through the magazine.</p>
<p><strong>11 int. dressing room - closeup - corner of dressing table
11</strong>: Lots of people are schmoozing in the dressing room. There’s
a loud buzz of excited chatter. Hands are stack- ing flowers, good luck
messages, cards and cables by the mirror. Through the blur and bustle,
we glimpse the doll with its embroidered ribbon message “RACHEL, WE LOVE
YOU.” Hands casually move it to one side, among the flowers resting on
the small portable TV set. On the screen is an image of Rachel
performing on stage, acknowledging applause, bowing. The doll EXPLODES,
SHATTERING the TV, the MIRROR and the</p>
<p><strong>light bulbs.</strong>: The SCREEN GOES BLACK, amid SHOUTS,
SCREAMS and</p>
<p><strong>12 ext. frank farmer’s house - back yard - day 12</strong>:
Frank lounges in his shorts under the single tree, sun- glasses on, a
glass of iced tea by his side. Strains of “DON’T WALK AWAY RENEE” come
from a beat-up transistor</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: So, you won’t protect Rachel Marron just
because she’s in show business?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t do celebrities.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: But the biggest money’s in show business
people.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Do you really do these things?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Isn’t she the one who collects dolls?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Farmer, Rachel Marron is one of the most
famous people in America. She’s won every music award invented. She’s
got the number one song in the country right now and she’ll probably be
nominated for an Oscar in her very</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You mean she doesn’t collect dolls?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Yes. She collects dolls.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I thought I knew who she was.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: You’re probably deadly with these things,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Deadly.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Why are you resisting this job? $2,000
bucks a week. $2,500.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There are several good men available for that
kind of money. Have you talked to Fitzgerald or Racine? Portman?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Yeah. Portman was interested…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: … but we’re told you’re the best.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s no such thing.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Farmer, we’re talking about a very
frightened lady. With a</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: All right. I’ll come and I’ll look the
situation over. If I take it, it’s three thousand a week.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Okay. You must be very deadly for three
grand a week.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Shit.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know it’s something like…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Better not stand right behind me.</p>
<p><strong>13 ext. marron estate - waverly lane - day 13</strong>: Frank
stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street from the closed,
unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron driveway.</p>
<p>****: The use of the term FRANK’S POV, is not to be taken simply as a
camera direction. Rather, it re- presents a recurring attempt to make
the audience see in the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant
vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and his burden. The
audience must be put in the position of He has a curious sense of being
watched, a kind of prick- ling on the back of his neck. As he looks
around, a black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives
rapidly off – too fast to get a clear look. He watches it go. Frank
pulls up to the gate and gets out of his car. He grabs a bar of the gate
and pulls. The whole gate rattles. Frank gets back in his car and pushes
a button on the intercom box at the side of the gate. A MAN’S VOICE
CRACKLES out of the BOX. Transmission is terrible.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Alexander Graham Bell to see Miss Marron!</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: Have you got an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The atomic number of zinc is 30.</p>
<p><strong>man’s voice</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: as he moves up the winding drive
through heavily land- scaped grounds. Plenty of potential hiding places.
The mansion is at the top of the hill. The grounds behind the mansion
fall away.</p>
<p><strong>15 ext. mansion - circular drive/entrance area - day
15</strong>: The mansion is huge. On and on it goes. Frank drives PAST
the garage area where HENRY, the chauffeur, is polishing the mascot on
the limousine. One of his arms is bandaged. Henry peers at Frank, puts
down his cloth and walks toward the entrance where Frank is parking.
Frank gets out, looks around. A painter’s truck is parked nearby, two
painters unloading equipment from it.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are you the man on the intercom?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: No. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: My name is Edison. I have an appointment with
Miss Marron.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Oh. And that was arranged by…?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Mr. Devaney.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Go right ahead, Mr. Edison.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What happened to your arm?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: A doll.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Henry Ford, to see Mr. Devaney.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Come in, please.</p>
<p><strong>16 int. marron mansion - day 16</strong>: Frank steps into
the foyer with Emma. She is a warm, matronly woman who does a fine job
running the house without standing on custom.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: I’ll tell you quite honestly, Mr. Ford, I
don’t know where Mr. Devaney is. Did he say he’d be here?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Then he probably is. Let me look.</p>
<p><strong>emma</strong>: Please make yourself at home. Can I get you
anything?</p>
<p><strong>17 int. marron mansion - various rooms - day 17</strong>: The
deeper Frank walks into the house, the warmer and more lived-in rooms
appear.</p>
<p><strong>18 int. marron mansion - sun room - day 18</strong>: Frank
steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool area. One wall is all
glass. On the opposite wall are shelves containing the trophies of
Rachel Marron’s career: A Tony award, three Grammy’s, gold and platinum
records, other statuettes and plaques. Among the framed photo- graphs of
Rachel accepting awards etc., is one of her and</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: Dwarfed by the pool, the only person in
sight is seven- year old Fletcher, the little boy from the photograph,
dark-haired and fragile. He is crouched at the side of the pool with the
remote control unit for a foot-long speedboat which is cutting across
the water. A nanny sits, some way off, embroidering. Frank’s attention
is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL BEAT comes from somewhere nearby
in the house, another Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and
bouncy. Frank follows the sound.</p>
<p><strong>19 int. family room - day 19</strong>: Frank walks into the
rear of the room that the noise is coming from. It is large and
comfortable with plenty of seating, a bar, a wall of stereo gear and a
projection booth. It is packed with people, props and video equipment.
There is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized chaos.
MUSIC BLARES out. A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic
dance number for a music video, directed by their choreographer RORY.
Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the glass wall at the end
of the room. A video cameraman circles them, taping the rehearsal, which
appears on a large-screen TV behind them. In one corner, a pretty black
girl is being pinned into a proposed costume for the video. Several
people are stand- ing around, tending to the video and playback gear.
All the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn’t immediately
apparent how many more people are hidden among the big cushions. As
Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel chair turns to
reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and makes his way over to him. On the
other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his late thirties
rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inch neck. Devaney signals to
him that everything is all right. The brawny man looks at Frank a moment
more, then sits down. Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with
vitamins. Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being used as
a coaster. People smoking and chatting through the rehearsal.</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Playback, everybody!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Come here, Rory!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Sugar, that’s gonna be great. I love the
ending…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Rachel…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Nicki, how’d you like the number? You like
the end routine?</p>
<p><strong>director</strong>: Rachel. You wanna see it back from the
beginning or just the ending…</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: It was just great, Rory…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I wanna see it all. Tony? I’ll bet Tony
loved it.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Ehh!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t worry, Rory. Tony doesn’t appreciate
great art.</p>
<p><strong>dress designer</strong>: What do you think, Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Rachel, Frank Farmer is…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Devaney, do you think this is me?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: It’s terrific…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Rachel, Frank Farmer is here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Who’s here?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Frank Farmer. The bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I think Rory should be my bodyguard. Let’s
see the back again…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Rachel, raise your butt out of there and
meet this man.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, I’m up.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Frank Farmer, Rachel Marron.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You don’t look like a bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What did you expect?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t know. Tough guy maybe.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is my disguise.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, his timing’s good.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: This is Nicki, Rachel’s sister and personal
secretary.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: Nice to meet you, Mr. Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: … Tony Scibelli.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The back’s still not right…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: … Sy Spector, Rachel’s publicist.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Can we get you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Orange juice.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Straight? Nicki.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Rory, I’ll be with you in a second.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Listen, this whole thing is Bill’s idea…
This sudden obsession with protecting me. Tony has always handled my
security and we’ve done just fine.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Yes, I’ll hold but not long…</p>
<p><strong>rory</strong>: Rachel, you want to run through your steps
before we go again…?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’ll be with you in a second.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: I think Bill’s right, Rachel. It’s time you
took more precautions.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Nicki, I’m sure Mr. Farmer would tell you
the number of nuts writing fan letters jumps every time Rachel is on the
cover of a magazine.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Not like this.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Relax guys, I said I’d do it. You see what
I’m dealing with here? I’m willing to go along, as long as we all
understand each other. I’m not going to let this alter my life one
little bit. Who was this?</p>
<p><strong>assistant</strong>: Oh. That was Clive’s office. They called
three times…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Honey, that’s not going to be a
problem.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Rachel runs a very informal household,
we’re all on a first name basis…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: …And I’m sure you’ll blend in just fine.
You can select whatever alarm systems you want for the house. Some kind
of improved security for the gate. What else, Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I think I’m safe when I’m here at the house
so I guess the main thing will be when I go out. Tony will be able to
fill you in on all that. You two will have to work something out. I
don’t want both of you falling all over me everywhere I go. The most
important thing is this – I will not allow Fletcher to be affected by
this thing…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: I was just going to cover that. We’ll have
to tell the child you have some other function…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t want him to think he’s in prison. So
the house and grounds must not be altered in any way. He shouldn’t be
aware that you’re here. Is that clear?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Miss Marron…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s been a mistake. A misunderstanding.
If you’ll show me the quickest way out, we’ll save each other a lot of
trouble.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You can go past the pool.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Shut up, Tony.</p>
<p><strong>farmer</strong>: Nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Farmer, will you wait a minute?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Bill, I don’t think we should be begging
this guy for his services.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Sy, I’m handling this.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Farmer, will you wait a minute?</p>
<p><strong>20 ext. marron grounds - back lawn - day 20</strong>: Frank
is walking rapidly away from the window wall, down the slope. Devaney is
scurrying to keep up.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Farmer, will you wait a minute? I should
have told you more. I’m sorry but I was afraid she wouldn’t go through
with it. I thought I’d let the two of you work it out… come to an
understanding.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We did.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: She’s not a bad person, and whether she
knows it or not, she needs you. You’ve come this far… Would you just
wait here for one minute. I want to show you something. Please,
Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>21 ext. pool area - day 21</strong>: Fletcher, happy to have
someone to talk to, walks up to Frank with his remote-control speed
boat. Frank would like to walk away, but Fletcher blocks his way. Frank
looks at Fletcher’s frail little, nut-brown figure. The watching nanny
continues her embroidering, some way off.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Hi!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: How are you today?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: All right. How ’bout yourself?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Oh, I’m fine. Do you like boats?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. I don’t like boats.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You don’t! Why not?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Sure you do, but you don’t want to tell
me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re a smart kid.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll tell you. One time I was stuck on a boat
with some people for four months.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: A lifeboat?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nope. A big white yacht. Do you know what a
yacht is?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Yeah. My mom rented this huge yacht once,
and we took a trip. It was great. Everyone threw up except me. I love
’em.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, nobody’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You’re the bodyguard, aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you know about it?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I’ve got ears.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll remember that.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: How are you, Fletch? I’m glad you waited.
Let’s go over here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nice meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>22 ext. patio - day 22</strong>: Devaney slides the file
across the table at Frank, open- ing it. Inside are letters of every
size and condition. Repeatedly throughout this scene Frank’s gaze is
drawn to Fletcher, who has started his boat again.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: This is just in the last six months.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Have you ever tried having these
professionally assessed?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Devaney says you were in the Secret
Service.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Ever guard the main man?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I was two years with Carter and four years
with Reagan.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This is a little old lady in Akron. She’s
written to everybody I’ve ever worked for.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Reagan got shot.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Not on my shift.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: That’s good.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: At first glance, these don’t bother me. But
keep them. You never know.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This could be something.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: You think it could be the same guy? The one
who rigged the doll?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t know. Did you tell Miss Marron about
it? Does she know about the doll?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: We said there’d been some electrical
problem while she was on stage. Short circuit. Look, she doesn’t need
that kind of worry right now. It would upset her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What about the police?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: There was no reason for the police. No one
got hurt.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What about the chauffeur?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: It was nothing. It was just our people
there.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Sy, I think we should show him the
room.</p>
<p><strong>23 int. room - day 23</strong>: Frank follows Spector and
Devaney into the room. He glances around, taking in the murals, the
decor, the kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from the
pages of a tabloid layout.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is this her bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: No. She sleeps in a room next to Fletcher’s
down the hall. Sy had this done for a magazine layout,</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: ‘Superstars in their Boudoirs.’</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Rachel never liked it.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: She didn’t have to like it…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: We found the letter here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Somebody was in here?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Somebody broke in and … masturbated on the
bed.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: And she doesn’t know about this either?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Are you kidding? This would really freak
her out.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Someone penetrates the house, gets upstairs
and jerks off on the bed … I’d say that qualifies as a problem.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: What kind of problem?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Of fuck, we don’t need this now…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: This house is wide open.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I said this house is wide open</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Frank, I totally respect what you’re
telling me. Tell me how you want to work and I’ll accommodate you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Look, I can’t protect her. I won’t be
responsible for her safety if she doesn’t know what’s going on.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: I’ll talk to her, I’ll make her understand.
I can do that.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: No. I’ll talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>24 ext. marron house front - day 24</strong>: Frank emerges
with Devaney and crosses toward his car.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: …She won’t give you any static, Frank,
you’ve got my word on that.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sure she will.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: So what job’s perfect? You’re a bodyguard,
aren’t you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Devaney, if you ever lie to me again, I’ll
take you apart.</p>
<p><strong>25 int. marron mansion - frank’s room - day 25</strong>:
Henry Dupres is leaning against the doorjamb. The room is comfortable, a
guest bedroom. Frank flops one battered suitcase onto the bed and opens
it. He pulls open some drawers in the dresser and starts putting away
his clothes.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Why’d you say your name was Edison?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I wanted to see how hard it was to get
in.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: And it wasn’t, was it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Put this on your arm. It’ll help the
ache.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ll bet you can fill up a whole day just
washing the cars and driving Rachel Marron around town.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re adding to your duties.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re my new assistant.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Says who?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Henry, I’ve spent a lot of time guarding
people all over the world</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: The cocky black chauffeur.</p>
<p><strong>martin grove</strong>: It’s Oscar time again, folks, and with
Academy members marking their ballots today for this year’s nominations;
some canny tipsters in Vegas have announced their picks for the
Awards.</p>
<p><strong>martin grove</strong>: Echoing the prevailing buzz in
Hollywood, the Vegas Hilton is gambling on one sure thing at least.
Newcomer Rachel Marron is tipped at 3 to 1 to lead this year’s Best
Actress runners.</p>
<p><strong>martin grove</strong>: The sultry singer made a notable
acting debut last fall in Queen Of The Night, singing the hit song ‘I
Have Nothing’. The lady may end up eating her words if she takes home
that statuette March 20th…</p>
<p><strong>26 ext. perimeter of estate - various shots - day
26</strong>: The fortification of the estate begins as Frank and Henry
walk the grounds. Frank talks and points, Henry takes notes on a pad.
Frank gestures at the stonework of the gate, points at the top of the
stone wall along Waverly Lane. At the tall hedges which separate the
estate from its neighbors, Frank gestures to take in the entire length
of the hedged border. Henry stops in amazement. Frank keeps walking.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher’s pov</strong>: Frank and Henry are down there
conferring about the fence.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: appears beside Fletcher, looks down there
too, then leads her son purposefully away. Fletcher isn’t happy about
it.</p>
<p><strong>29 int. marron estate - pool house/ballet studio - day
29</strong>: A small room at one end of the pool house has been fitted
with a wall mirror and ballet exercise barre. A STEREO plays exercising
MUSIC. Nicki, dressed in leotards, is doing pre-aerobic stretch- ing
exercises. Frank appears outside the window. Nicki waves him in. Unseen
by Frank, a huge St. Bernard lays in the front of the door. He muscles
his way in, the dog never moves, just slides along the floor as Frank
pushes the door open. Frank looks the room over.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Unusual tactic for a guard dog, but
effective.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: You can look around if you like.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sorry to disturb you.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: That’s all right. It’s an excuse to rest.
It’s my private place. I’m the only one who works out around here.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: My own ego wall. No platinum records.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You and Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: When I was a kid, I put a little band
together. We played high school dances, stuff like that. Then Rachel
joined the act. As you can imagine, she was quite a little entertainer.
Even then, she had a way of stopping the show. So I kind of quit.
Professionally, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You never went back?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: It was pretty obvious who the star in our
family was.</p>
<p><strong>30 ext. marron estate - garage area - day 30</strong>: Frank
and Henry walk toward the closed garages.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: That depends on what you call a ‘hint.’</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t want anyone on the street to be able
to look at the cars and know who owns them.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I don’t think there’s anything here you’d
call a ‘hint.’</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Get new plates for those two.</p>
<p><strong>31 ext. gate area - day 31</strong>: The fortification
continues as workmen use a bulldozer to clear away the stonework around
the entrance.</p>
<p><strong>32 ext. driveway of marron estate - day 32</strong>: Sitting
beside Henry, Frank teaches him how to spin the limo in a 180 degree
‘skid turn,’ sending up clouds of dust. A group of roadies watching
bursts into spontan- eous applause.</p>
<p><strong>33 ext. gate area - day 33</strong>: Fletcher sits on the
grass about halfway to the house, watching the activity with delighted
interest. He turns as he spots something beyond the hedge.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher’s pov</strong>: Workmen put up a seven-foot cyclone
fence. Across the road, a black Toyota 4 X 4 is stopped. It slowly pulls
away. We can’t see inside it.</p>
<p><strong>34 ext. gate area - day 34</strong>: One worker pries a small
boulder out of a hole with a crowbar. His partner picks up the rock and
tosses it on a small pile of rocks. The boulder bounces down the
backside of the pile.</p>
<p><strong>35 int. rachel’s bedroom - day 35</strong>: Rachel, looking
out her window at Fletcher and the work- men, sees the rock stop a yard
from him. Fletcher scrambles away, much as a kid might dance back from
a</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Fletcher! C’mon. Back in here!</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I think he’s got a black 4 X 4. Could be a
Chevy. More like a Toyota.</p>
<p><strong>36 int. f.b.i. los angeles office - conference room - day
36</strong>: The room is dark. An opaque projector throws an image onto
a screen; it is a letter threatening Rachel’s life. We hear voices. One
is Frank’s; the other two belong to special agents RAY COURT and TERRY
MINELLA. The letter is one of the pasted-up threats we saw being
assembled earlier. It reads:</p>
<p><strong>when you shall die…</strong>: Reading as fast as possible, we
pick up some vicious threats and obscenities, but we don’t have time to
read it all before we…</p>
<p><strong>frank’s face</strong>: illuminated by the screen.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: This is another of the ones we think are
worth pursuing. Lots of work went into it. No prints. We’re doing lab
work on it. It could be nothing.</p>
<p><strong>minella’s face</strong>: is illuminated above the
projector.</p>
<p><strong>minella</strong>: This is the one you think is tied to the
doll?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s what her manager thinks.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: This ‘I Have Nothing’ business is a natural
with the record and movie and all.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: I sort of lost track of you after
Washington.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: How’s the private stuff?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: Big money, I bet? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>37 int. federal building - day 37</strong>: Minella and Court
walk Frank to the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: Shit. I knew it. It is big money. Fuck! You
need an assistant? I’m ready to get out. I’ve lost my tolerance for
assholic behavior. You should see the jerk we’re covering now…</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: ‘Hellfire Henry’ Kent…</p>
<p><strong>minella</strong>: Shh! Somebody wants to pop him…</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: Which isn’t exactly surprising, considering
what the shithead’s</p>
<p><strong>minella</strong>: Yeah! Do everyone a favor… As you know,
we’re nonpolitical these days.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: We’ll put this stuff through Washington.
Behavioral Sciences should have something in a few days.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thanks. Ray?</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why am I getting all this cooperation?</p>
<p><strong>minella</strong>: She’s a big star. Important people care
about her.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: Politics and show business are practically
the same these days… Got any crowd photos we can use?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m trying to keep her away from crowds.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>38 int. the ivy - day 38</strong>: It’s busy. Lots of
customers arriving, leaving and seated at tables. Waiters criss-cross
the terrace. Near the entrance, Rachel is saying goodbye to a
middle-aged WOMAN. Frank stands nearby with Nicki. The Woman says
something to Rachel, who turns and looks at Frank. Rachel whispers
something to the Woman and they both laugh. They kiss and Rachel moves
toward the entrance.</p>
<p><strong>woman</strong>: Goodbye, Nicki. So great to see you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m surprised you didn’t plug them.</p>
<p><strong>39 ext. the ivy - day 39</strong>: Rachel attracts the usual
stares from passersby. As they reach the limousine, Frank continues
scanning the street. Tony stares at him, uncomprehending.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: O.K. Henry, let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>40 int. front seat of limo - day 40</strong>: Frank sits
beside Tony, next to the door. Tony speaks to him in a near whisper.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Let me set you straight on a few things. For
starters, I love this lady… What I do for her I do for</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov - black toyota</strong>: appears in the rearview
mirror.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I do things the way she likes. Her happiness
is everything to me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No problem. I’d like to know how you handle
things, Tony.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I handle things fine, Frank. You watch me and
you’ll learn something.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Turn left.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Is that him?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey, what’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Shortcut.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov - toyota in rearview mirror</strong>: As the limo
turns, the 4 X 4 follows them into the turn.</p>
<p><strong>angle - frank</strong>: whispers to Henry.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Slow down, very slow.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: You want me to do a one-eighty?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, just slow down.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Why are we stopping? Are we here?</p>
<p><strong>41 ext. marron estate - day 41</strong>: The limo enters the
gate where workmen are rigging a large fence.</p>
<p><strong>42 int. limo - day 42</strong>: Frank speaks to Henry.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stop here… Take them to the house.</p>
<p><strong>angle - tony, rachel and spector</strong>: As the car pulls
away they see Frank running wildly across the property.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What’s with him?</p>
<p><strong>43 ext. marron estate - day 43</strong>: As Frank comes
through some bushes, he suddenly catches a glimpse of the 4 X 4 through
the trees. It starts to accelerate. As it pulls away , he breaks into a
full run toward the other end of the property. Leaping hedges, Frank
crashes through tropical vegetation. CRASHING through a bamboo forest,
he scurries down a steep wooded slope toward the road below. The 4 X 4
can be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off.</p>
<p><strong>44 int. marron estate - day 44</strong>: The fortification
continues as workmen tighten screws, install electrical wiring, test
alarms. As Frank watches over the work, we see him show Henry how to
wear a SURV KIT communications system.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Keep this loose.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Tell me about the car?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Toyota. Black.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Four wheel drive? Late model?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: One snag though.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: 360,000 of them in Los Angeles. I checked.
Nice work, though.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Well, nobody’s perfect, Frank. Are
they?</p>
<p>****: Can I try that?</p>
<p><strong>45 ext. marron estate poolside - day 45</strong>: Rachel has
been watching Fletcher and Frank down the hill. Now she leans back on
the chaise lounge where she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song
on a Walkman.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Shut up you assholes!</p>
<p><strong>46 int. rachel’s bedroom - day 46</strong>: A mild-looking
OLD LOCKSMITH is working on Rachel’s window. Rachel walks in from the
pool, starting to peel off the swimsuit. She stops, startled, as she
sees him. This is the last straw. She blows up.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You! You! Out! Out! Now! Out of here! Get
out!</p>
<p><strong>old locksmith</strong>: Yes, ma’am. Thank you. I’m a real fan
of yours, Miss Marron.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Then you can take your tools with you.</p>
<p><strong>47 ext. marron estate - gate/guard house - day 47</strong>:
In a BIG CLOSEUP ON a black and white TV screen, we see Devaney’s
immaculate convertible Mercedes 500SL as it roars up the drive. Frank,
Henry and Fletcher watch in the newly-erected guard house. The area is
greatly changed. There is a uniformed guard with an impressive array of
switches, lights and phones at his command. There are several TV
screens; one of them shows a series of endlessly-panning shots from
cameras at the rear of</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Is that Devaney?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: She’s got him by the short ones, doesn’t
she, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, she makes him nervous.</p>
<p><strong>48 int. family room - day 48</strong>: Nicki is cutting fruit
at the bar. Rachel, very tense, is taking the fruit and dropping it into
a yogurt drink she’s making in a blender. Rory, her choreographer,
stands behind her, massaging her neck and shoulders. Spector is perched
on a bar stool like a vulture. Devaney hurries into the room; Nicki
gives him a look.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I want him gone.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: What is it now?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: He told Rachel no Sunday brunch at
Charlie’s.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: No Sunday brunch. That’s why you called me
up here?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That is not it! It’s my money and my life
and I want him out of here.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: On the patio.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He’s through messing with my life.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Rachel, I’m getting goddamn sick of running
up here every time he steps on your toes. Farmer! Would you come in here
a minute?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Did you know he was nuts?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Do you know who couldn’t get past the gates
yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Robin Leach, that’s who.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: You think that’s funny? The man talks to 20
million people and he can’t even get in here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Did he have an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Farmer, what is this about brunch at
Charlie’s? Rachel’s been going there every Sunday for the last five
years.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t want her doing anything she’s always
done.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: ‘I don’t want her doing anything she’s
always done.’ The guy’s a fanatic.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: So are the guys he’s protecting you
from.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Excuse me if I don’t faint.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: Think of Fletcher –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Do you know he’s got the phones bugged?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Oh Jesus, Bill.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Maybe he gets off listening to my calls. All
that heavy breathing…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: What do you want from my life?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I want some peace around here.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’re almost done.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And I want to be able to eat brunch with my
friends.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Go on Tuesday this week.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Tuesday – morning – brunch. Where did you
find this guy?</p>
<p><strong>48a ext. thrift shop - valley - day 48a</strong>: Rachel’s
limousine is parked opposite the shop. It’s a decidedly downscale area.
A little way off, a group of unemployed youths hang around, eyeing the
limo with interest. Henry sits at the wheel. Tony stands by the open
window, leaning against the car.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: I wish Rachel didn’t keep coming here. It
makes me nervous.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Me too. ’Cept I’m not nervous ’cos I got you
with me.</p>
<p><strong>49 int. thrift shop - close on clothes hanger - day
49</strong>: SCREECHING as it’s slid along a metal rack. Rachel is
shopping for bargains, moving along racks of discarded clothing.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Louise, you’ve got too much great stuff.</p>
<p><strong>owner</strong>: Take it all, darlin’.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Wooo! Let me try this on.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Farmer, do you want to come in here with me?
Just to be safe?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You probably won’t believe this, but I have
a reputation for being a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I didn’t used to be. But you get known for
being a certain way – a way people think you are – and pretty soon you
get like that. Can’t help it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You don’t think so? You’re such an expert on
famous people?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve seen a few.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And you disagree?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You can be as you choose to be. It’s an act
of discipline sometimes, but it can be done.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That why you never stay with one of your
clients? They too undisciplined for you? Or is it you’re afraid you’ll
start to care about them?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Can’t you answer straight just once? Why
don’t you talk to me? I’m not such a bad lady.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re too clever for me. I can’t keep
up.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Look at me, Farmer!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You don’t approve of me, do you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Disapproval’s a luxury I can’t afford. Gets
in the way.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t like emotions getting to you, huh?
Never mix business with pleasure?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Grab that would you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m here to keep you alive… not to help you
shop.</p>
<p><strong>50 int. darkened room - closeup - night 50</strong>: We see a
man’s hands remove a video cassette from its sleeve. The cover reads
“RACHEL MARRON - THE #1 HITS.” The CASSETTE is gently eased into the
slot of the video player.</p>
<p><strong>angle frank</strong>: Frank sits alone in his room, lit by
the glow of the TV, dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie. He’s
watching Rachel’s videos. Scattered around the video player are a
collection of other Rachel Marron CD’s, tapes and videos. Frank has been
noting down lyrics on the yellow legal pad on his lap. Some of the
phrases are circled. As he watches, we see a subtle change in his
expression. It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first
time, here, watching her sing. For a second, she seems to be singing to
him alone, passionate and vulnerable. He opens a small box and removes a
tiny enamelled Russian Orthodox-type cross. He fastens the clasp,
checking that it holds, then looks back to the screen.</p>
<p><strong>51 ext. marron estate - night 51</strong>: Rachel’s SONG
PLAYS OVER the moonlit estate.</p>
<p><strong>52 int. rachel’s bedroom - night 52</strong>: The room is
surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty apart from Rachel’s
collection of old and faded dolls on the shelves and on the bed. Rachel
is getting dressed for the evening. A hairdresser stands behind her,
fussing with her hair. Rachel hears the MUSIC coming from outside and
moves to the window. Gazing across the garden, she sees the light in
Frank’s room and hears her own voice singing out from there too.</p>
<p><strong>53 ext. marron house - night 53</strong>: Frank is showing
Henry how to check the underside of the limo with an angled mirror on a
stick. Both are crouched beside the vehicle. A noise makes them look up.
Rachel, dressed to the nines and looking very sexy, emerges from the
house with Spector and Devaney. Spector’s carrying a videotape. Tony
follows as they head for the car, where</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I thought it was dinner.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Are we going somewhere else?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: The Mayan, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s the Mayan?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: It’s a club, Frank. Come on, Henry, let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Spector, you’ve got to tell me about these
things.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: I just did.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Nice suit, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I want you to keep this.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: For me? It’s beautiful.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s fitted with a radio transmitter. When
you close the clasp, it sends a signal. If there’s ever a problem and
we’re separated, just press it and I’ll know you need me.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Okay, she knows how it works, let’s get
going.</p>
<p><strong>54 int. limo - night 54</strong>: Frank rides beside Tony in
the front seat. The RADIO PLAYS SOFTLY in the b.g. In back, Rachel,
Spector and Devaney are drinking champagne. Tony burps, smiles at
Frank.</p>
<p><strong>radio d.j.</strong>: You’re listening to K.R.O.K., the rock
of L.A. and yes we have.</p>
<p><strong>radio d.j.</strong>: We told you we’d crack the case of the
mystery guest… and if you are one of the few who hasn’t heard, it’s
Rachel at the Mayan.</p>
<p><strong>radio d.j.</strong>: Rachel Marron, tonight, appearing as
Billy Thomas’ very special guest. But if you don’t have a ticket, you
can forget going down there. Police are asking us to ask you to stay
away. So everybody, please stay cool, stay tuned and we’ll try to get
you some interviews after the show. Remember, you heard it here on
K.R.O.K. – the station that delivers.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: It wasn’t me.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Fuckin’ a.</p>
<p><strong>56 ext. backstage entrance - night 56</strong>: As Rachel’s
car pulls up, the beaten man dances weirdly at the curb with blood
streaming from his nose. A pair of security guards try to hold them
back. As her limo stops, a chant begins.</p>
<p><strong>crowd</strong>: Rachel! Rachel! We want Rachel!</p>
<p><strong>57 int. rachel’s dressing room - night 57</strong>: Rachel
steps into a room set for a star’s arrival. Flowers are on every surface
that will hold them. One huge arrangement is so big it has to be placed
on the</p>
<p><strong>journalist</strong>: … and this is my exclusive?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: I swear I thought she’d talk to you. Maybe
later. What can I say.</p>
<p><strong>59 int. dressing room - night 59</strong>: Rachel sits in
front of the mirror putting on the silver headpiece we saw earlier. She
notices a small spray of lilies-of-the-valley among the floral
arrangements. An envelope marked “Rachel” is attached to it. She reaches
forward and opens it. We see the note as she unfolds it.</p>
<p><strong>for death - the time to die is…</strong>: We see the shock in
her face.</p>
<p><strong>60 int. star’s suite - night 60</strong>: Spector, Frank, and
Devaney are there. Rachel seems dazed, unfocussed. Devaney hands the
note to Frank.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: He sent another one.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What do you mean ‘another one’?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: They didn’t tell you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Tell me what?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: There were some letters before, Rachel…
same kind of thing, threats, oddball stuff…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: We didn’t want to worry you…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: … and somebody got into the house…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Someone was in my house?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Okay. Let’s not get hysterical…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Let’s get her out of here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Someone was in my house?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: It was weeks ago. You were out of town…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: While Fletcher was there?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Listen, Fletcher is okay. The house is like
Fort Knox now. Right, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We should get her out of here. Right now!</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: There’s no way anyone could…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No way anyone could what?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: No, wait… look everybody calm down. Calm
down.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Sy.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Let’s just see how she is. How do you feel,
honey?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can’t protect her out there.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Do you think he’s out there?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He’s here, isn’t he?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He might be.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: We don’t know that. Frank, we don’t know
that.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But you know he was in my house… oh my
God.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Let’s go home, Sy. We’ll have to make an
announcement.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Fine, you make it, they’ll tear the fucking
place apart.</p>
<p><strong>61 int. onstage - night 61</strong>: A lone mike stands
onstage. The crowd’s growing im- patient. A RHYTHMIC CLAPPING begins.
Devaney walks timidly onstage. He’s not happy to be there. He reaches
the mike and taps it with a finger.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Excuse me… hello… I’ve got an announcement
to make. I’m sorry but… due to circumstances beyond…</p>
<p><strong>62 int. backstage - night 62</strong>: Frank guides Rachel
toward the stage exit. A roar from the audience begins. “Rachel! Rachel!
Rachel!” It grows louder as they near the exit. Rachel’s expression is a
combination of fear and humiliation. When they have almost reached the
exit, she stops.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Rachel… don’t do it. It’s not worth it…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No fucking freak is gonna chase me off
stage.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: I’m afraid that…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Rachel won’t be able…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Bill Devaney, ladies and gentlemen, thank
you, Bill. Hey, everyone. Hello! Isn’t Billy Thomas the greatest. He’s
asked me to sing a song. I hope you don’t mind.</p>
<p><strong>angle - rachel - shot from behind</strong>: shows her alone
and vulnerable, bathed in light, center- stage. Rachel snatches a quick
glance at Frank then looks back to her silent audience.</p>
<p><strong>angle - frank</strong>: He scans the audience intensely, face
to face.</p>
<p><strong>63b int. mayan - night 63b</strong>: Rachel approaches the
end of her song, her voice coming ever stronger. Spector comes up to
Frank in the wings, positioning himself combatively between Frank and
his view of Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Are we having a communications problem
here?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Apparently, I didn’t make it clear to you
how things go around here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You told me you were going to tell her. And
you didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: I didn’t think she could handle it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: But she handled it fine.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Look. Frank, I know what you’re saying. I
know you want to do what’s best for her. I understand that. You have a
job to do here. But you have to understand that Rachel has a job to do
too. And that’s what she’s doing - out there. She’s working, Frank.
That’s what she does and that’s where she does it. She’s hot right now.
This is the time for her. If she doesn’t get out there, she’s dead.
Forget about crazy death threats, if she doesn’t sing, she’s dead
anyway… Look, handled properly, this thing could be good for a million
dollars’ worth of free publicity.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: One word.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: It could clinch her the nomination.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: One word in print about any of this…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Trouble with you is you don’t understand
the sympathy vote.</p>
<p><strong>64 int. stage - night 64</strong>: Rachel scans the crowd,
spread before her like a surreal mural. Camera flashbulbs explode like
crazy through the glare. The thundering adoration is like a stimulant.
She darts a look to Frank and gives him a fierce “naughty girl”
smile.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You like that? Would like to hear another?
Billy?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I think my feet are trying to tell me
something… wanna see a new video?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I want to dance…</p>
<p><strong>angle - frank</strong>: Frank’s task has suddenly become
impossible. A forest of hands and faces start to engulf Rachel. Anyone
could be the killer. Frank’s eyes dart over them all, his gaze intense,
as if trying to hold them off by sheer willpower.</p>
<p><strong>rachel’s pov</strong>: Looking offstage at Frank. His
frustration is almost intoxicating to her. She struts over the lip of
the stage. A man leaps up from audience to join her. Frank starts
forward. Rachel gestures to him to hold back, waving him off.</p>
<p><strong>65 int. wings - night 65</strong>: Spector stands well out of
Frank’s reach, staring at Rachel onstage. He catches Frank’s attention,
yelling back defiantly.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Look at her, fucking great.</p>
<p><strong>66 int. onstage - night 66</strong>: Rachel dances erotically
with the man – bumping and grinding, sinking to her knees. The crowd
roars approval. Frank quickly sizes up the scene. He speaks into a SURV
KIT microphone in his sleeve. Across the room we see Henry listening,
pushing an earpiece to his ear. Henry quickly scurries to an exit. Frank
starts moving toward the stage. At that moment, the lucky man Rachel’s
dancing with grabs her around the waist and spins her gleefully, like
the dance partner she has been pretending to be. One of security guards
rushes forward to extri- cate her. The spinning man inadvertently bumps
hard into the guard and the man loses his grip on Rachel. She flies out
of his grasp and tumbles off the front of the stage – into the adoring
arms of a half dozen fans. The audience goes wild. This is the kind of
thing Rachel was famous for when she was starting out. The scene
resembles a rugby scrum… with Rachel the ball.</p>
<p><strong>close on rachel</strong>: Fear fills her face. She’s gone
over the edge, literally and figuratively. She’s lost control. Tony and
the security guards are fighting to get to her, slamming bodies out of
the way. In the b.g., the video continues on its serene, uninterrupted
way.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: He spots a fire extinguisher in the
wings.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: Frank grabs it and heads to center
stage. He aims the extinguisher at the crowd between Rachel and the
stage. The chemical foam does its job, scattering fans. Frank leaps onto
the floor, kicking a wild-eyed young blond man in the chest as he fights
his way to Rachel, taking her in his arms. Tony runs ahead of Frank,
knocks a fan off the stage and waves for Frank to follow.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tony, not there.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: I’ll take care of this.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Just follow me.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Make way here. Outta the way!</p>
<p><strong>68 ext. alley - night 68</strong>: Rachel and Frank emerge
from the darkness between two garbage bins and get into the limo Henry
has waiting there. The car moves out with a SCREECH of tires, narrowly
missing Spector as he staggers out of the building.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Hey! What the fuck… Farmer! Farmer! Come
back here…</p>
<p><strong>69 int. limo - night 69</strong>: Frank turns and looks at
Rachel. She is diminutive, doll-like, alone in the center of the large
limousine seat. Her hands rise to her face and her body begins to shake
with sobs as she sits there alone in the tattered remains of her dress.
Frank turns away to avoid staring at her, but he feels</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Never done that before.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s been a long night.</p>
<p><strong>70 int. the mayan - night 70</strong>: The crowd is thinning
out. A dim worklight is burning somewhere backstage. The auditorium is a
mess; the cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the riot.
FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, walking, pausing, as if looking for something. Lying
on the floor in big CLOSEUP we see a small fragment of Rachel’s dress.
The FOOTSTEPS STOP by it. A hand picks it up gently and lifts it OUT OF
FRAME. We hear the sound of a deep lingering INHALATION of breath. The
feet move on.</p>
<p><strong>71 int. marron house - night 71</strong>: Fletcher is asleep
in his bed. Frank waits as Rachel glances in. Then she moves away.
Opening the door to her room, she steps back, allowing him to enter
ahead.</p>
<p><strong>72 int. rachel’s room - night 72</strong>: Frank moves
quickly into the room, checking the window and French door. Rachel waits
silently by the door. All is clear. He steps back to the door. As he
approaches her she begins to tremble. He gently reaches out and takes
her in his arms. Slowly holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside
some of Rachel’s dolls, laid out on the pillows. Her hands go
automatically to her dress but they are shaking so badly she cannot undo
it. Frank gently does it for her. She willingly allows him to undress
her and not a word is spoken between them. As she sits naked still
trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her gently into bed. As
he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of his hand. He
looks down, stroking her forehead like a child’s.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Aren’t you going to ask me why I behave like
that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I know why.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t want to talk about this again.</p>
<p><strong>74 ext. marron estate - driveway - dawn 74</strong>: Frank
has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate house and now begins
walking up the drive toward the man- sion. The grounds are quiet,
beautiful, misty. We see him from behind some foliage, as if he’s being
covertly observed, stalked. A twig snaps and he turns sharply. It’s
Rachel. She’s dressed in a soft jumpsuit and starts jogging out from
behind the bushes towards him.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hey! Gotcha, didn’t I?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re probably wondering what I’m doing.
You didn’t know I jogged, did you?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What’s the matter? ’Fraid I’ll get picked
off in my snazzy running suit?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. I’m afraid I’ll have to jog with you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Great. I guess I can’t do it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Will you walk with me a little?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know this is kinda late, but thank you.
I’m really glad you’re here. I’m going to try to cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That would be good.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Farmer… I have this problem. This minor
little problem. You see, I’d like to go out for an evening. Just me and
a guy. You know… … like a ‘date.’ But I can’t go out on a date because
you have to be with me every minute. I mean, what if he invited me up to
his place afterwards? Are you going to come, too? So the only thing I
can figure is for you to take me out. So… that’s what I was wondering …
you know. What do you think? But only if you want to.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Only if you want to… I’m not so bad… God,
this is embarrassing. I’m gonna run up ahead there. You decide.</p>
<p><strong>75 ext. marron estate - balcony - day 75</strong>: Nicki is
yelling from a window on the second floor of the mansion. Fletcher peers
out with her.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: Rachel! Sandy Harris is on the phone!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Tell her she’ll have to wait, babe. I’m
getting fixed up here.</p>
<p><strong>at window - close on nicki</strong>: She watches Frank and
Rachel, her expression neutral. She turns away. Fletcher continues to
watch his mother with Frank.</p>
<p><strong>day</strong>: The SOUND is DEAFENING. A wet car comes out of
the tunnel of machinery. In the distance, glimpsed through the spinning
brushes, Henry talks to a couple of workers as he waits for the limo to
be cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>d.j.</strong>: … And here’s another biggie from a lady very
much in the news these days, Miss Rachel Marron…</p>
<p><strong>d.j.</strong>: … the hit song from the movie… Queen Of The
Night… I Have Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>77 int. locker room - wash-a-rama - day 77</strong>: Tight,
shabby facilities. Dan opens the combination padlock to his locker and
deposits the crumpled photo inside. As the hands remove the rubber
gloves, the inside of the locker is revealed. Pasted over every inch of
the locker are pictures of Rachel Marron. One tabloid shot of her
dancing with the word “whore” scrawled across it. Taped to a single
sheet of white paper in the center, like a holy relic, is the torn scrap
of Rachel’s dress from the MAYAN. The hands pin up the newly-acquired
photo next to it.</p>
<p><strong>84 int. fbi laboratory - day 84</strong>: Special Agent Court
is seated next to a white-coated technician. The technician is leaning
over one of the neatly pasted-up death threats we have seen earlier.
With a scalpel, he lifts the word “whore” from out of the message. He
sets it on a white sheet, then brings the blade back and scrapes at the
residue of the dry glue on the letter.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, he didn’t look like he wanted to die
to me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: There’s a big difference between wanting to
die and having no fear of death.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And because he had no fear of death, he was
invincible?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, he sure creamed ’em all in the
end.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, it was a good movie.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How many times have you seen it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Sixty-two.</p>
<p><strong>86 int. restaurant - night 86</strong>: It’s a bit of a dive,
but the food is good and the atmos- phere is great.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Your kinda place?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Your kinda music?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You figure no one can get by you here?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If someone is willing to swap his life for a
kill, nothing can stop him.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Great. What do I need you for?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He might get me instead.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And you’re ready to die for me?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s my job.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And you’d do it? Why?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can’t sing.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Maybe there’s some glory in saving a
president or something, but just anyone…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You mean like you? It’s a matter</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t trust discipline. At the crucial
moment I’d cop out.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That happens.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But not with you, Fierce Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It happens.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Have you ever liked anybody?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Like me – a girl.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: A long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What happened? Do you mind if I ask?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Do you mind if I don’t answer?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t want to pry…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She didn’t die did she? You weren’t like…
protecting her and she got killed?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh, my god! That’s it, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Nobody’s perfect.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh Frank, I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No… Nice try though. It was less dramatic
than that. She didn’t love me anymore. Can you imagine such a thing?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No, not really.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: So, is this a full service date, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m just asking you to dance.</p>
<p><strong>87 int. dance floor - night 87</strong>: Frank and Rachel
navigate a tiny dance floor. Frank is a surprisingly good dancer and is
comfortable being this close to her. Rachel hums softly, picking up the
words to the song. As we listen to the lyrics something clicks in her
head.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You like this?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m sorry… It’s just that… It’s so
depressing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It is, isn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t worry, I’ll protect you.</p>
<p><strong>88 ext. frank’s house - night 88</strong>: Frank’s car is
parked in the driveway. A light goes on in a basement window.</p>
<p><strong>89 int. frank’s house - basement 89</strong>: Frank hangs
back, drink in hand, as Rachel explores the basement. Frank has fitted
it out as a combination gym/ target range/weapons workshop. The place
has a kind of unfussy order about it, a simplicity.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s very quiet here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: West Virginia University Football. God, look
at you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What’d you play?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: End.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Were you tough?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. Fast.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You some kind of a samurai, too?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: They said you were in the Secret Service.
What made you get out?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Money.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I can see your tastes are extravagant.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Watch yourself.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You’re a hard one to figure, Frank
Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It seems to me a bodyguard must know little
peace.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Watch this.</p>
<p><strong>90 int. frank’s house - bedroom - night 90</strong>: Their
lovemaking is INTERCUT with SLOW MOTION black and white images of
Samurai warriors from the movie, Yojimbo.</p>
<p><strong>91 int. frank’s house - bedroom - later 91</strong>: They lie
nude under a sheet.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’ve never been this safe before.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No one could get by you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Right now it might not be so hard.</p>
<p><strong>92 int. frank’s bedroom - next morning 92</strong>: The
roller-blind is raised with a sharp, snapping sound. Frank is moving
around the room, getting dressed. Rachel</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What? What is it? What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Rachel, I don’t want to get confused about
what I’m doing here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m not confused.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You pay me to protect you, that’s what I
do.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What? Have I done something wrong?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, nothing.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Then what is it?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Do you want me to beg?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, I want you to do without.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What’s going on, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I want to keep it straight in my head what
job I’m doing.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And what is that exactly? Making me feel
like shit?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, I’m sorry. This is my fault.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t apologize for godsake. Just tell me
what I did. I’m a big girl.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You didn’t do anything. It was me. I involved
myself with my client.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Your “client”?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I made a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What mistake?… You don’t find me attractive
anymore.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Christ! I’ve told you why. I can’t protect
you like this.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: And what? That’s it for me?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t believe it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You can live with that or you can fire
me.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: But I can’t fuck you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t believe this… I’m asking you?… Let
me tell you…</p>
<p><strong>93 ext. marron estate - poolside - early morning 93</strong>:
A nanny sits in the early morning mist, embroidering. Frank is kneeling
with Fletcher beside the pool. He’s putting new batteries into
Fletcher’s boat. Fletcher watches him as he tears off the wrapping from
the batteries, much preoccupied.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: She’s real mad at you, isn’t she?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: She told me she doesn’t understand why
you’re so shitty to her…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’ve spent a lot of time learning not to
react to things like other people do. It’s my job. But it doesn’t always
work, Fletcher… it doesn’t always work.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I don’t think I understand.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m an old man compared to you, pal, and I
don’t understand either. And I’m starting to get the feeling I never
will.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: Ta Da!</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: Thought you’d like to know. Everyone said she
was a sure thing. Of course, you know all about that.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: I’m sorry. That was out of line. It’s none of
my business… Here’s today’s question marks for you.</p>
<p><strong>94 int. squirrel hill productions - janitor’s room - day
94</strong>: Frank is investigating the small packet, with a surgeon’s
precision, checking it with a stethoscope and a metal detector, sniffing
at it. It has been addressed in the normal way, except that Rachel’s
name has been cut out of a magazine and pasted above the address. He
begins carefully slicing away the wrapping. Inside is a cardboard box.
The contents are still hidden by packing paper. He picks it away with
tweezers. Suddenly there is a LOUD BUZZING from the box and movement in
the paper. Frank drops the box into a bed of sand in a sink surrounded
by sandbags. The movement slows and stops. Frank extracts the item – it
is a wind-up mechanical beaver with a hand-painted sign hung around its
neck:</p>
<p><strong>sally and kate.</strong>: The beaver’s TEETH CLICK in Frank’s
hand. We see Frank’s face. This may just have taken years off his life.
He holds his hand out straight, palm downwards,</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Farmer! Get in here!</p>
<p><strong>95 int. squirrel hill productions - rachel’s office - day
95</strong>: The office is filled with congratulatory balloons and
flowers heralding the morning’s news. Spector’s secretary is taking
congratulatory phone messages at a desk in the b.g. Two assistants are
struggling in through the door with a large basketed floral
arrangement.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Put together a list of your expenses. Your
total billing… Let me have it in one hour and I’ll see that a check is
cut.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Don’t you ever say what’s on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: What’s on my mind is that you’re fired,
Frank. She missed all her interviews yesterday because of your little
date. Do you realize she stood up Barbara Walters? First you fuck up her
career…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: … and now you’re fucking with her head.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s between us.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: You think so? You forget who signs your
check. You don’t understand the role I play around here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Get your shit together and be out of here
by noon.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Frank stays.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: With this high a profile, Rachel needs
protection now more than ever. If he goes, you can forget Miami…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: She’s signed the fucking contract, Bill.
You want me to read it to you?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Fuck the contract. If he goes, she’s not
singing a note. It’s too dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Oh. ‘Fuck the contract.’ Great. Why don’t
you let Rachel speak for herself? I think she has some say in this.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Frank stays.</p>
<p><strong>secretary</strong>: Mr. Schiller calling on line one…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Well, I guess this is democracy in
action.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: I gave in. That’s not easy for me. Don’t I
get a hug?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Yeah?… Sure, put him on… Ben how are you?…
uh huh…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: …The Ambassador? What the hell are you
trying to pull, Ben? Rachel always gets the Presidential… I don’t care
what you thought…</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Do you know the Fontainebleau Hotel in
Miami Beach?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: How does the Ambassador Suite compare to
the Presidential for us?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s on the twentieth floor in the south
wing. There’s a service elevator right there. Mainly ocean windows.
Should be no problem.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: … I’m aware of that, Ben, but let me just
remind you people that you invited us…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hang around, Farmer. We might need your
vaunted expertise.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hello, Ben honey.</p>
<p><strong>schiller</strong>: Rachel, congratulations, you must be
thrilled at the…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Ben. I hear you’ve got me in the annex next
to the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>- day</strong>: We COME STREAKING IN OVER the ocean TOWARD
the towering white Fontainebleau. ON the SOUNDTRACK, we hear JOHN TESH’S
VOICE filling the viewers in on the latest Hollywood dirt.</p>
<p><strong>john tesh</strong>: …It’s off to Sun City today for Best
Actress nominee Rachel Marron. Rachel’s giving two AIDS charity concerts
this week at Miami’s Fontainebleau Hotel. A thousand a plate no less.
And rumor has it that the lovely lady has unseated the governor of
Florida himself. Seems there was a showdown on who’ll get to lounge in
that big Fontainebleau penthouse tonight.</p>
<p><strong>john tesh</strong>: Well, sleep tight in the Presidential
Suite, Rachel. Who says a nomination isn’t as good as winning…</p>
<p><strong>97 ext. presidential suite - balcony - day 97</strong>: Frank
looks up at the disappearing helicopter then down</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thuringer.</p>
<p><strong>thuringer</strong>: God damn. I’ll get someone right on
it.</p>
<p><strong>98 int. presidential suite - day 98</strong>: Frank walks
quickly across the living room of the lavish suite. Two uniformed
security guards are making a sweep of the room with POLICE DOGS. Frank
checks the drawer of a side table and then seals it with a peel-off
security tape. Thuringer is waiting near the entrance hall. Frank nods
to him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>99 int. hallway - 15th floor - day 99</strong>: This is a
semi-private corridor; several hotel employees are steam-cleaning the
carpet. Frank looks at them, then Thuringer.</p>
<p><strong>thuringer</strong>: It’s okay, they’ve been cleared.</p>
<p><strong>thuringer</strong>: The Katzes of St. Louis. Very prominent.
Come every year. An elderly couple and three grandchildren. A nurse and
a maid.</p>
<p><strong>thuringer</strong>: Hi, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>mark</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>thuringer</strong>: Theirs is the only suite on the
floor.</p>
<p><strong>thuringer</strong>: As you asked, the rooms below have been
kept vacant.</p>
<p><strong>100 int. stairway - day 100</strong>: The doorway closes
behind the two men. Frank tries it; it’s locked. They continue down the
stairs.</p>
<p><strong>105 int. kitchen - day 105</strong>: Frank and Thuringer walk
into and along the edge of the busy kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>109 int. offstage area - day 109</strong>: Frank walks ahead
of Thuringer. He looks around and pauses at the edge of the stage. Then
he steps out on a stage. A piano tuner is at work in the corner.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov -</strong>: as he looks out at the mammoth room.
Frank stands center stage and looks around. The naked- ess of this spot
gets to him. He shakes his head and looks at Thuringer. Thuringer
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What a silly job this is.</p>
<p><strong>111 int. fontainebleau hotel - lower lobby - day
111</strong>: Behind the glass doors that lead to the pool, bright
quartz lights clock on. A camera crew stands waiting. Someone mimes a
“we’re rolling” sign with his hands. Inside Rachel waits with Spector
and BEN SCHILLER, the tough, fat fellow who owns the place. Frank is at
her elbow.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: O.K. Rachel. It’s showtime! They’re
rolling. Let’s go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is this really necessary?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Yes. It is.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Quit bitching, Farmer. This is the part you
do get paid for.</p>
<p><strong>112 ext. pool area - day 112</strong>: This place is crowded
with hundreds of guests basking on chaise lounges. A sea of sun-baked
faces virtually as far as the eye can see. The sight of the crowd and
the presence of the news crew seems to push Rachel to a whole new
adrenaline level. Rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating
the bodies displayed before her in words and expressions, playing to the
camera.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Oh my God. Look what they’re wearing.
Mother, hide your eyes…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I couldn’t wear that suit… Honey, you’re
naked… Of course, if I had a body like that…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Great, babe. They got what they needed.
Let’s get back inside.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You look like a man of good taste to me.
Come to my party tonight. Ben, make sure this boy gets to my party.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you. Thank you. Come tonight and give
till it hurts.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m beginning to wonder about your
judgement, Sy. Why do I have to keep paying my dues if I’ve already
arrived?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Kick me, beat me… whatever makes you feel
good. But let’s not pretend you don’t like it. We’re too close for that.
Whipping people into a frenzy is why you got into it in the first
place.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: And it’s nothing to be ashamed of, either,
not for a second. It’s a gift… and only a handful are given it. Many
call but few are answered.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Don’t fool with the blessing, Rachel. The
magic is sustained through its use.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Now you’re going to tell me about magic?
Give it a rest will ya…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: I’m done. Not another word… … I know you
like to be reminded sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>113 int. grand central room - on stage - night 113</strong>:
In the spotlight, all alone, Rachel Marron works her magic. She sings,
as it was meant to be sung, “I Have Nothing.” One person does not look
at Rachel. He stands in a corner in front of the stage easily in the
shadows. His eyes continually scanning. Picking up every movement. All
alone. Watching.</p>
<p><strong>113a ext. fontainebleau hotel - night 113a</strong>:
Fireworks explode over the water.</p>
<p><strong>114 int. living room - night 114</strong>: In the living
room, the first night party is in full swing. Crowded. Smoky. Noisy.
Fireworks burst outside the windows. People clap. A mixed bag of upscale
partygoers: women in party dresses, men in open shirts, etc. A black
pianist is playing. Two bars at either end of the room. Waiters work the
room with platters of canapes.</p>
<p><strong>115 int. rachel’s suite - outside master bedroom - night
115</strong>: Tony sits in a chair watching TV, a drink in his hand,
oblivious to all. The lifeguard shuts Rachel’s door be- hind him and
makes his way down to the party. He pauses at the head of the stairs,
checking out the party, and grabs a glass of champagne from a passing
waiter. Frank catches the movement; the two men briefly lock eyes. The
lifeguard responds with a knowing smile.</p>
<p><strong>116 ext. hallway outside suite - night 116</strong>:
Thuringer has set up a checkpoint through which all guests are passing.
As they get off the elevator, they walk up to a desk manned by one of
Thuringer’s uniformed guards. When their names have been checked off a
master list, they walk past another guard wielding a metal detector. No
one likes it, but they all do it. Most of the local TV stations have
sent camera crews. The handheld cameras move among the guests, their
bright lights flaring. FLASHBULBS POP. It’s a local media event. Frank
squints as a quartz light shines straight in his face. A tall, fit,
athletic-looking man raises his arms; is cleared by the metal detector.
He is GREG PORTMAN.</p>
<p><strong>117 int. living room - night 117</strong>: Portman makes his
way through the crowd to the bar. His eyes scan the suite. His gaze
settles on Frank checking out the people who filter in. Portman appears
next to Frank.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Hello, Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Portman.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Buy you a drink?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Orange juice. It’s been awhile. You on the
job?</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Technically I’m off duty, but the Governor
may show up here later, so I thought I’d give it a light check. Someone
else is covering him right now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How old is she?</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Maybe eighteen. You working?</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: No kidding? I’d call that a step up from
the President. Probably sings better too.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you. Thank you. You’re so right.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I want everyone to have a good time and
drink as much of Ben Schiller’s liquor as you like.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Handful.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: I heard you had to take someone out in New
York.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: I lost track of you after the Reagan
thing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: It wasn’t your fault, Farmer. You weren’t
even there.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: I got a call a couple of months ago. That
guy you were covering in New York. He said you’d recommended me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Surprised?</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I never doubted your skills.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: No. Only my qualifications for the
priesthood. You were always clear about that. Anyway, I appreciate it. I
had to turn it down but I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s orange juice!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Greg Portman.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I take it you’ve met my bodyguard?</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: We used to work together.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Ah… Well, well, well. And what do you do
now?</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Same thing as Farmer.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Two samurai, eh?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Are you working now?</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Not right now.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Good. ’cause I’m the only one in the room
who needs protection.</p>
<p><strong>118 ext. living room balcony - later 118</strong>: Rachel’s
taking a breather on the balcony, drinking cham- pagne, talking to
Portman and another couple. Everybody’s high and happy. Conversation
bubbles.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: Rachel leans into Portman; heads
together, they whisper intimately. Rachel laughs, then for a brief
moment, turns her head to look directly at Frank. Her look is petulant,
defiant. Portman does not see this.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What happened!</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Somebody tripped. It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank God I had a bodyguard here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel’s pov</strong>: Staring down twenty stories of
distance between her and the pool area. Way, way below her, her
champagne GLASS hits the tile with a MUFFLED SHATTERING sound.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s a long way down, Frank. You saved my
life.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Maybe someone will keep an eye on me while I
change.</p>
<p><strong>woman in green</strong>: I’ve been watching you all night
from across the room.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why don’t you go back there and keep
watching?</p>
<p><strong>123 int. rachel’s bedroom - night 123</strong>: Rachel and
Portman are kissing, with some heat. Portman’s hands are starting to
explore her body.</p>
<p><strong>124 int. living room - night 124</strong>: Frank still looks
at Rachel’s doorway, thinking. After a moment, he walks across the room
to the sliding doors that lead to the balcony outside.</p>
<p><strong>125 ext. balcony - night 125</strong>: Frank steps outside.
No one there. The moonlight re- flects off the ocean. The SURF sounds a
STEADY BEAT. It is peaceful and quiet. A relief. On the Katz’s balcony,
forty feet away, little Mark Katz is leaning against the railing,
staring at Rachel’s suite. Frank smiles at him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong>126 int. rachel’s bedroom - night 126</strong>: Rachel and
Portman are still locked in the clinch. Realizing what she’s doing,
Rachel suddenly pulls back,</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’m not doing this.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: I think you are.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I said I was grateful. Thank you and good
night.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Please go now.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Mr. Portman was just leaving us, Tony.</p>
<p><strong>127 ext. balcony - night 127</strong>: Frank looks out at the
ocean. ECHOING on the soundtrack, we hear the song ‘WHAT BECOMES OF THE
BROKEN HEARTED’ that Rachel and Frank danced to. It sounds slow and
sweet and a long way away. Frank stares out at the ocean. Totally
divorced from everything in the suite behind him, in the world around
him. There is only the moon and the ocean. For this</p>
<p><strong>127a int. presidential suite - living room - day
127a</strong>: A chambermaid is Hoovering the floor. Rachel steps out of
her bedroom. She looks terrible. Hungover, she is wearing sunglasses and
a loose smock. It is noon of the following day.</p>
<p><strong>130 int. presidential suite - kitchen - day 130</strong>:
Frank is sitting at the kitchen table eating a sandwich. Behind him, in
the dining room, a Cuban maid has set a place with breakfast. She is
pouring orange juice as Rachel walks in. Rachel sits down at the table
as though the walk in had been a terrible effort. She looks at the
breakfast with distaste and picks up the coffee. Frank continues to eat.
Rachel looks at him.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What the hell are you looking at? You
probably never had a heavy night in your whole, goddamn disciplined
life.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You know, Farmer, you’re a self- righteous
son-of-a-bitch.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t laugh at me, goddamit! And don’t you
dare judge me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Give me a break, will ya? I didn’t tell you
to fuck everybody in the hotel!</p>
<p><strong>132 int. cleaning supply warehouse - day 132</strong>:
Special Agents Court and Minella are watching the general manager of the
supply house as he pries the top off a huge canister marked “INDUSTRIAL
DETERGENT.” The general manager lifts the lid to reveal white
powder.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: It matches the traces in the glue, Frank.
We’re getting to him.</p>
<p><strong>133 int. fontainebleau - lobby - day 133</strong>: Frank is
on the courtesy phone.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, well, don’t take too long, Ray.</p>
<p><strong>court</strong>: Hey, Frank. It’s good money, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>day</strong>: The elevator door opens and Frank steps out. He
walks toward the entrance to the suite and is immediately alarmed by
what he sees: there is no uniformed guard by the front door. He unlocks
the door and goes inside.</p>
<p><strong>135 int. presidential suite - entrance - day 135</strong>:
Frank comes in and looks around quickly.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov - living room</strong>: Looking over living room,
hallways, balcony. No one in sight. Nothing disturbed. Devaney comes out
of Rachel’s bedroom, a panicked look on his face.</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: They face each other across the gulf
of the living room.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where is she? Where’s Tony?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: I don’t know. I thought you were with
her.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Thuringer, this is Farmer. Where’s your man
on the door to the suite? Well get someone up here.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He doesn’t know.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>139 int. suite - entrance hall - day 139</strong>: Frank is
almost at the door. We hear LAUGHTER. A key turns in the lock. Rachel
and Tony come through the door in high spirits, their arms full of
shopping bags and packages. Frank stops dead and watches. Rachel glances
at him and goes into the living room. Tony looks at him meaning- fully
and follows. Frank reflects for a moment, then pulls the front door
closed, oh so gently.</p>
<p><strong>140 int. suite - living room - day 140</strong>: Rachel drops
packages around and goes to the bar, pours herself a drink. Tony takes
some packages to Rachel’s bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Hello, Devaney.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Rachel, where the hell have you been?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Tony and I went over to Bal Harbour. Did a
little shopping.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: We were worried. You know you’re not
supposed to do that.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Farmer, you work here! Do you understand
that? You work for me.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Farmer, where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m gonna check the route. As usual.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Did Fletcher call?</p>
<p><strong>141 int. service elevator - day 141</strong>: Frank’s face
shows the tension and the anger. The ele- vator descends.</p>
<p><strong>141a int. kitchen - day 141a</strong>: Frank walks along the
edge of the kitchen, looks over the workers. A kitchen worker is in
Frank’s path. He looks up, sees Frank’s face and scurries out of his
way.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Gomez! Louis Gomez!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>enormous cuban</strong>: Is none of you fuckin’ business.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Move it.</p>
<p><strong>enormous cuban</strong>: Shove it up you ass,
motherfucker.</p>
<p><strong>cleaning woman</strong>: Stop! Please. Don’t hurt him. Please
stop!</p>
<p><strong>cleaning woman</strong>: Don’t hurt my husband, mister. He
not up to nothing.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>145a int. rachel’s bedroom - night 145a</strong>: Rachel is
seated at her dressing table applying her makeup for the evening’s
performance. The telephone RINGS as she begins to work on her hair.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Fletcher?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Baby, is that you? It’s mommy, honey.</p>
<p><strong>dan</strong>: Guess again, whore! Fuck you and fuck Miami.
I’m coming for you. I know where you are and I’m coming for you…</p>
<p><strong>146 int. presidential suite - living room - night
146</strong>: Frank comes in the front door. He’s had it. Devaney, who
has been sitting alone in the living room, stubs out a cigarette and
stands to meet him. Frank doesn’t pause.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m through. I’ll get you back to L.A. and
that’s it. The guy with Fletcher can cover you till you get a
replacement.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: She got another call, while you were
downstairs and she answered it herself. It was him, Frank. Same guy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t care.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Farmer, it really shook her up. She thought
it was going to be Fletcher calling her from L.A. I think she’ll be
reasonable now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Save it, Devaney. The people who hire me
don’t have to be convinced to save their own lives.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Call me when she’s ready to go down.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Farmer –</p>
<p><strong>147 ext. balcony - night 147</strong>: Frank looks out at the
ocean. The breeze washes over his face. A huge brightly-lit yacht is
sailing by, close to shore. Frank looks at it reflectively.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Farmer… Nothing that’s happened between us
matters… I understand now… You’re going to have to believe me, because
I’m not going to beg.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It wasn’t what he said… it was the way he
said it… he was so…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I need you… I’m afraid… and I hate it. I
hate my fear… Please protect me… Protect Fletcher… If anything happened
to him…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I can’t protect you like this. It’s
impossible. The odds are on his side.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I’ll do whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I want to take you away for a while.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Somewhere people don’t know about.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No Spector or Devaney or Tony.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If you cross me up this time, I’ll kill you
myself.</p>
<p><strong>barking.</strong>: A van emerges from the trees, tires
CRUNCHING through the snow. Frank’s father, HERB, steps onto the front
porch. He’s in his mid-60’s, lean, tan and fit. He’s wearing a plaid
shirt, jeans and cowboy boots. The van stops in front of the house.
Frank steps out from the driver’s seat and eyes his dad.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Lake’s a little low.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Fill up soon enough when she thaws. They all
in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Just one.</p>
<p><strong>149 int. living room - day 149</strong>: Herb squats on the
floor with Fletcher. Together, they are happily playing around with the
fluffy terrier. Fletcher squeals with delight as the dog licks his face.
Henry brings the remaining luggage through. Rachel and Nicki stand with
Frank near the archway. All eyes are on</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s going to protect us?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s a trained noisemaker.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Terrific.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t like big dogs. They don’t know who
they’re eating.</p>
<p><strong>150 int. kitchen - late afternoon 150</strong>: Herb stands
beside a butcher block, cutting vegetables for the evening meal with a
practiced hand. Rachel watches, drink in hand, looking around the
kitchen. It has been neatly organized.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Katherine had this place organized just the
way she wanted it. Frank’s momma.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Fletcher doesn’t swim well.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: I guess he’d better stay in the boat then.
Frank tells me you’re a singer.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: I’m afraid we’re a little out of touch here.
I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: You must be very successful to need Frank.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It’s so quiet here.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Frank came back and stayed six months after
the Reagan thing.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Frank wasn’t there the day he was shot. He
never got over that. We buried Katherine that day.</p>
<p><strong>151 ext. on lake - sunset 151</strong>: Fletcher, Rachel and
Frank are chugging across the golden water in the skiff. Fletcher sits
at the back, operating the outboard, controlling the movements of the
boat. He wears a life vest. Rachel watches him proudly. Fletcher locks
the throttle into place and takes his hands off it for a laughing moment
with a “Look, Mom, no hands” gesture. Rachel looks to Frank and smiles,
the wind blowing her hair.</p>
<p><strong>wide on lake - dusk</strong>: CAMERA is DOWN at water level
by the lake’s edge. In the distance, the small boat skims across the
surface. A light mist is coming up.</p>
<p><strong>152 ext. boathouse - dusk 152</strong>: Henry helps Fletcher
tie up the boat for the night. It is much foggier now and almost
dark.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t want anyone going out in it until
you’ve checked it over first. Okay? Every time.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Every time.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Every time.</p>
<p><strong>153 int. hallway - later 153</strong>: Rachel, munching on a
raw carrot, browses a row of family photographs. The sounds of dinner
being prepared come from the kitchen. We see the history of the family
in the pictures; Frank as a ten-year-old baseball player with a younger
Herb; Herb as Police Chief of Bend, Oregon, being given a civic award;
Frank as a college football wide receiver; Herb and Katherine Farmer,
all dressed up and being introduced to Jimmy Carter by Frank; the
picture-perfect family home in Oregon with Katherine tending flowers.
Rachel notices a photo of a smiling Henry Kissinger, talking to some
female reporters. There standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him, are
Frank and Portman. Portman’s also smiling at the women, flirting. Frank
is in a familiar pose, alert, unsmiling, vigilant. Rachel looks at the
two of them for a second. Frank steps from the kitchen with an orange
juice and a drink for Rachel in his hand. He watches her for a moment as
she studies the photo. She turns and sees him. They lock eyes for
several seconds. She smiles as he hands her the drink.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Portman sometimes had trouble remembering
what his job was. Supper’s ready.</p>
<p><strong>154 int. dining room - later that night 154</strong>: The
meal has been enthusiastically consumed. Fletcher’s manhandling a
chicken leg, his face covered with crumbs and drippings. Rachel shakes
her head, laughing.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: … And I never hit him. Ever. To this day.
That’s true, isn’t it? That’s very unusual for my people. So what
happens? When he’s ten years old, he complains about it? Can you believe
that?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Oh, for Chrissake! I’m going to tell her
about the time you stripped in court.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: I don’t care. I’m proud of that. Anyway, he’s
ten years old and he’s just started playing tackle football. He comes to
me and tells me he’s afraid of getting hit, right? And he thinks it’s
because I never hit him. ‘Why don’t you ever hit me?’ he says to me!</p>
<p><strong>155 int. kitchen - night 155</strong>: Frank puts down the
dishes in the darkened kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: If you’re lucky, maybe he’ll tell you about
my first jockstrap.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: He got over it: Turned into a helluva wide
receiver. He couldn’t stand being afraid. When he found something that
scared him, he’d just do it ’til the fear went away.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: His mother was the same way.</p>
<p><strong>157 int. living room - later 157</strong>: Herb delicately
lifts a chessboard from the top of a cabinet and walks it over to the
table: A half-finished game. He leans over and blows on the pieces –
sending a small cloud of dust into the air.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Come on, son, you can run but you can’t
hide.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Your move.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: How long has this game been going on?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Three years.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: He had me on the run there that first
year.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Knight to king-four.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: City kid.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Come over here, Fletcher, sit by me.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Well, that’s it for me, I’m going to
bed.</p>
<p><strong>158 int. upstairs hall - night 158</strong>: Frank stops at
the end of the hallway, checking the lock on the window, the little
terrier is at his heels. Rachel pauses outside the door. Frank gestures
for the dog to stay. The dog sits in the middle of the hallway looking
from one to the other. For a few seconds neither speaks. Frank
smiles.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Good night, Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Good night, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>159 ext. farmer house - night 159</strong>: Details are
barely distinguishable in the fog. We hear the gentle LAPPING of the
LAKEWATER against the dock.</p>
<p><strong>160 int. living room - night 160</strong>: Fletcher is
asleep, snuggled on Herb’s lap by the fire. Herb is also asleep. Frank
fetches a blanket and gently</p>
<p><strong>161 int. entrance hall - night 161</strong>: Frank steps
quietly into the hall. Nicki is standing in the shadows. She watches as
Frank goes through the ritual of locking the front door, several
ways.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: You’re very thorough.</p>
<p><strong>various shots - around interior</strong>: Frank makes a
circuit through the rooms of the first floor, checking windows and
doors. Nicki tags along.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: What’s happening between you and Rachel?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: Come on. One minute she’s got magnetic hands,
the next she hates you. I can’t figure out what it is now.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You follow all her moves this closely?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: It’s a living.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, it isn’t.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: You think my life is pretty sickly, don’t
you?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: You must. I do.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Why don’t you change it?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: Is it that easy?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re a lovely woman.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: But you don’t want me.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: I’m surprised. Thorough fellow like you. Why
stop at one sister when you can fuck them both?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I make my mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: But you didn’t say no to the boss.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: No, don’t go away, Nicki. Don’t leave me with
that. Tell me about it. Tell me how long you’ve been second. Tell me how
she has a child and you don’t. Tell me something. But don’t turn away
and try to stick it on me.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: I don’t need this from you.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe I need it. I’m fed up with people
telling me they have no control over their lives. If you hate your life
so much, turn it around.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: It’s not so simple.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yes it is. You can walk out that fucking door
anytime you want. I’ll unlock it for you.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: Let me go.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Okay. It’s not my business.</p>
<p><strong>162 ext. lake - day 162</strong>: Bright sun. Frank and his
father walk along the lake shoreline, stooping here and there to finger
animal prints in the snow and mud.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Raccoon… deer…?</p>
<p><strong>162a ext. porch - day 162a</strong>: Nicki absently sings an
old gospel tune as she tosses breakfast scraps to a group of hungry
ducks gathered by the porch.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: I’ve never heard church music in the middle of
the week before.</p>
<p><strong>162c ext. porch - day 162c</strong>: Nicki’s soft voice is
joined by Rachel’s strong harmony, and the two men watch as Rachel comes
out to join her sister on the porch, startling Nicki. Both sing for a
moment, together. Then Nicki stops, embarrassed. Rachel gives her a
hug.</p>
<p><strong>162d ext. lake - day 162d</strong>: Herb and Frank are about
to return to the house. They stop short. There, at their feet, is a line
of human foot prints, from heavy snow boots, leading away into the
trees. Frank looks at Herb, suddenly alert.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where’s Fletcher?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Frank! I haven’t…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Fletcher! Fletcher!</p>
<p><strong>in boat</strong>: Fletcher, intent on his piloting, neither
hears nor sees Frank running down the lawn behind him. The boat is
approaching the end of the dock.</p>
<p><strong>dock</strong>: Frank finally makes it to the dock and
continues to sprint after the boat. His weight rattles the boards as he
runs.</p>
<p><strong>in boat</strong>: Fletcher passes the end of the dock and
gives the throttle a little twist.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No! He can’t swim!</p>
<p><strong>in water</strong>: Frank holds the terrified, shaking
Fletcher in his arms. Fletcher begins to cry. Frank paddles with him
toward the dock. The empty boat swerves, then continues out toward the
center of the lake.</p>
<p><strong>dock</strong>: Henry and Rachel are already at the end of the
dock. Nicki and Herb are running toward it. Rachel is livid, hysterical.
Henry peers out at the boat, which continues to bounce innocently across
the water, defining a broad curve.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Fletcher, baby. Are you all right? Baby.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: He’s all right.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What are you doing? You out of your mind?
You’re crazy! You’re all right, baby. You could have drowned him!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m sorry. I got careless.</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: Frank, I’m sorry. I should have…</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: It’s okay, Henry.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: You all right now, son?</p>
<p><strong>henry</strong>: How do we get the boat back?</p>
<p><strong>162e int. bedroom - day 162e</strong>: Rachel and Nicki
hurriedly pack their bags. Fletcher hovers nearby.</p>
<p><strong>162f</strong>: Frank slides out from under the van. The hood
is up. Henry stands nearby. Frank goes to the driver’s seat.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Back off.</p>
<p><strong>162g ext. porch - day 162g</strong>: Herb comes out of the
house, fast. His eyes scan the woods as he heads towards the shed.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Frank!</p>
<p><strong>162-i ext. lawn - day 162-i</strong>: Henry and Herb watch.
Frank gets out of the van. He walks to Herb.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Someone’s cut the phone lines. It could be
anywhere between here and town.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Both the cars are dead. And I can’t see how
it was done.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who could know we’re here? This place has
nothing to do with her.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Maybe it has to do with you.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: We can’t walk out of here at night with
them.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We’ll button down tonight and walk out at
first light.</p>
<p><strong>162j ext. farmer house - night 162j</strong>: There is a
light ground-mist. The moon shines down down brightly but the house is
totally dark.</p>
<p><strong>162k int. house - montage - night 162k</strong>: The terrier
dog listens in the upstairs hallway. Herb watches from an upstairs
window. Rachel lies in bed, clutching Fletcher tightly.</p>
<p><strong>164 int. living room - middle of night 164</strong>: Frank
has been sitting in a chair in the center of the living room for two
hours. Listening. Now we listen</p>
<p><strong>166 int. kitchen - night 166</strong>: Nicki is sitting with
her head in her hands at the kitchen table, sobbing. There’s a nearly
empty bottle beside her. Frank is instantly on the alert but makes no
sign.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: I was an idiot last night.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: What do you think about today?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I think this is no maniac. He knows what he’s
doing.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: You’re right. He does.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tell me about it.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who is it, Nicki?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: He almost got Fletcher today…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How do we stop him?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: …my darling Fletcher…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You can call him off.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: He doesn’t even know who hired him. He
doesn’t know who I am and I don’t know who he is.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How’d you do it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: …I went to a bar in East L.A. I asked around…
I talked to a man…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Name?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: …Armando… He arranged it. That’s all I
know…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Is it all paid for?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: … and then some… Till it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He keeps going until he kills her?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What’s the name of the bar?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: I’m not sure… I was very stoned.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How ’bout the letters?</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: No, no. You don’t understand. The letters
came first. I don’t know who’s sending them… but they’re reading my
mind… Those were my thoughts. I hate her. It made me think I could do
it… But I could never hurt Fletcher. Never. You’ve got to stop it!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: We will. You and me. Tomorrow we’re going
back to L.A. We’re going to find the bar, we’re going to find
Armando.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: Don’t you even want to know why?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You told me. She has everything.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: What if we can’t –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stay here. Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>168 int. stairs - night 168</strong>: Frank runs up them
fast. Two at a time.</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: It’s me!</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What’s happening?</p>
<p><strong>171 int. first floor hallway - pov - moving shot - night
171</strong>: We’re in someone’s POV moving along the hallway. Nicki
steps out of the kitchen a few feet ahead and looks in terror toward the
CAMERA.</p>
<p><strong>nicki</strong>: No, no… stop… I’m the one who…</p>
<p><strong>172 int. second floor hallway - night 172</strong>: Frank and
Herb spin around. Rachel calls from her room.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Frank?</p>
<p><strong>172a int. first floor hallway - night 172a</strong>: A
GUNSHOT BLASTS Nicki against the wall, her hand still delicately raised
in a classic gesture of restraint.</p>
<p><strong>172b int. second floor hallway - night 172b</strong>: Frank’s
head spins to Rachel’s doorway, then immediately back to Herb. He starts
to move towards the stairs, fast.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stay with Rachel!</p>
<p><strong>173 int. stairs - night 173</strong>: Frank is rapidly down
the stairs, gun in hand.</p>
<p><strong>173a int. first floor hallway - night 173a</strong>: Frank
finds Nicki’s body slumped against the wall. He checks her. She’s dead.
The door beyond is open. The wind blows in. Outside it’s foggy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: We’re okay!</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Stay with Rachel!</p>
<p><strong>175 ext. farmer house - night 175</strong>: The fog is thick.
Frank swiftly emerges from the back door and stops, dead still,
listening. There is only the RUSTLING of TREES.</p>
<p><strong>175a int. rachel’s bedroom - night 175a</strong>: Herb is by
Rachel’s bed.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What’s happening? Where’s Nicki?</p>
<p><strong>herb</strong>: Be quiet!</p>
<p><strong>175b ext. farmer house - night 175b</strong>: Frank listens.
Suddenly he hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, a body breaking through the bushes.
Frank heads off towards the sound at a run.</p>
<p><strong>176a int. rachel’s bedroom - night 176a</strong>: Herb is at
the window. There is anguish on his face as he hears the SHOTS. He wants
to go to his son’s aid but knows he cannot leave Rachel. Rachel and
Fletcher are huddled in the bed, terrified. Fletcher clutches at the
DOG, which is still BARKING. Henry stands by the bed, gun in hand.</p>
<p><strong>176b ext. woods - night 176b</strong>: Frank moves quickly
through the woods, passes the splintered tree. We STAY WITH him and hear
the ENGINE of a CAR ROAR to life and TIRES PEEL OUT of the dirt. Frank
breaks out of the woods in time to see the red lights at the back of the
car as it fishtails around a bend. He EMPTIES his GUN at it. We hear
GLASS SHATTERING, but the car keeps going.</p>
<p><strong>minella</strong>: But, Frank, this doesn’t make sense…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>minella</strong>: We already got him.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: What? Where?</p>
<p><strong>179 int. f.b.i. headquarters - early morning 179</strong>:
Minella is talking with Frank on the phone. He’s looking into an
observation room through a one-way window.</p>
<p><strong>minella</strong>: Here, last night. You should see his
locker, Frank. The guy’s obsessed with Rachel Marron…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: You’re sure it’s him?</p>
<p><strong>minella</strong>: Forensics say it’s 100 percent positive
I.D… And he’s got a black Toyota 4 x 4. Ray’s with him now.</p>
<p><strong>minella’s pov</strong>: Sitting in the observation room at a
table talking to Ray Court is Dan. He looks frightened and confused.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Well, whoever you got down there wasn’t here
last night. This was a professional…</p>
<p><strong>minella</strong>: This is crazy… What do you want to do,
Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How long can you keep him?</p>
<p><strong>minella</strong>: Well technically all he’s done is write
some letters. 48 hours maximum. You know the deal.</p>
<p><strong>181 ext. marron mansion - driveway - day 181</strong>:
Rachel’s black limousine moves slowly up the winding drive, followed by
a black Mercedes limousine. Behind the cars, the gates close on a large
press contingent gathered outside, held back by a large number of police
and security guards. A light drizzle is falling. The two cars pull up to
the entrance, Henry at the wheel of Rachel’s. Frank gets out of the
front and opens the back door. Devaney and Spector help Rachel and
Fletcher out of the car. They are all dressed in black. A few other
mourners, including Emma, get out of the Mercedes. Rachel, red-eyed and
weary, takes Fletcher under her arm and goes inside. She does not look
at Frank.</p>
<p><strong>182 int. family room - night 182</strong>: A hand takes a
pitcher of orange juice from the refriger- ator and pours some into a
large glass. They uncap a bottle of vodka and pour a huge portion into
the orange juice.</p>
<p><strong>183 int. family room - night 183</strong>: It has grown very
dark in the family room. Frank is sitting all alone, perfectly still, in
one of the over- stuffed chairs, the vodka bottle on a table next to
him. He stares off into space. A small voice comes out of the
darkness.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: You okay, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, Fletcher, I’m okay. How ’bout you?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: I couldn’t sleep… It was so scary, just
thinking about it…</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Do you feel scared, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah, Fletcher, I do.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Everybody’s afraid of something, Flethcer.
That’s how we know we care about something, when we’re afraid we’ll lose
it.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: What are you afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I think you should try to go back to sleep
now, pal.</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Tell me, Frank, please. Is it the man who
killed Nicki? Are you afraid of him?</p>
<p><strong>fletcher</strong>: Then what? What are you afraid of?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m afraid… of not being there…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s late. Do you want me to take you back to
your room?</p>
<p><strong>185 int. hallway - night 185</strong>: Frank, silhouetted,
moves toward the stairway to the main level. There is light up
there.</p>
<p><strong>186 int. stairway - night 186</strong>: Frank begins climbing
the stairs. When he has gone a quarter of the way up, Rachel appears at
the top and begins walking down.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You, you, you… You brought this pain into my
house… Now you’re here! Where were you then? Why didn’t you save her? It
was your job to protect me and she died doing it… It was me they were
after. And you let them kill her! She never did anything to anyone.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She never hurt anyone. She was good. You saw
her. She never wished anyone any harm. Did she? Did she?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: She never hurt a soul. … I didn’t love her
well enough. I didn’t take care of her… … She gave me only love.</p>
<p><strong>186a ext. pool area - marron estate - day 186a</strong>: It’s
bright sunshine. Fletcher is splashing noisily in the pool with a few
other kids. His nanny waits patiently at the side, towels at the ready.
At one side of the pool, Rachel sits, lost in thought, mourning her
sister. At the other side sits Frank, also thoughtful. He, too, is
trying to adjust to the tragedy for which he bears some of the
responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>187 ext. marron estate - grounds - later that night
187</strong>: The guardhouse at the main gate is brilliantly illumi-
nated in the distance. The guard patrols at his station. Inside, the
T.V. screens flicker and glow. Perched on the top of a slight hill,
Frank sits alone and motionless under a big tree. He gazes down at the
gate- house, his face lit softly by the glow from its lamps. All around
him the rest of the estate is quiet and tranquil in the moonlight. After
a moment, another silhouetted figure slowly ap- proaches and stands
beside him. It’s Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I guess you’ve heard what’s happening.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Mind if I sit down?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: It isn’t over yet, is it?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He knows he still hasn’t got you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: So he’ll come again?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: It’s possible.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: The Oscars?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: When I was back in Squirrel Hill, I started
betting my friends fifty bucks each that someday I’d win an Oscar. You
can understand how important it is that they see me up there if I
win.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: If everyone of those pikers comes through,
it could add up to a lot of money.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I think it’s very dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I know. But I can’t stay up here on my hill
forever.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I didn’t get to this place in my life by
doing the smart thing every time. How ’bout you, Frank Farmer? Out there
on the edge… did you ever do something that didn’t make too much sense,
except maybe inside you? In your stomach somewhere? Something that
wasn’t smart? I’ll bet you have plenty. I’ll bet you do. Nobody gets
really good without it. And you’re good. I know that.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I don’t know why all this has happened to
me… … but I do know that none of it’s your fault. I hope you can hear
me, because this is how I say I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: So… I’m going to go see if I win an Oscar.
And I won’t worry about it at all. Because I’ve got you to protect
me.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s right.</p>
<p><strong>188 ext. the pantages theatre - night 188</strong>: The chaos
and razamatazz of Oscar night. Crowds, limos, cameras, searchlights…</p>
<p><strong>189 int. rachel’s limo - front of the pantages - night
189</strong>: The limo is waiting in a line of limos to reach the red-
carpeted entrance to The Pantages Theatre. Frank and Tony sit in front
with Henry. In the back a spectacularly-gowned Rachel sits flanked by
Devaney and Spector, both of whom, like Frank, are wearing tuxedos. Up
ahead, they can all see the hubbub at the entrance: TV cameras, lights,
photographers, arriving guests, two bleachers full of fans. The glare
from the arc lights is almost blinding.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: We’ll go straight back to the Green Room.
Right, Frank?</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: Got that, Tony?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tony knows what he’s doing.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I wish you boys would relax a little.
Nothing bad’s gonna happen out there, alright? Unless I lose the fucking
award.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Jesus, what a crew.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Screw it. I’m through worrying. When your
number’s up, it’s up. Right, Farmer?</p>
<p><strong>190 ext. limo - night 190</strong>: More quartz lights click
on. The TV cameras all focus on the door of the limo as Frank steps out
of the way.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: as he surveys the busy scene. A
microphoned M.C. peers into Rachel’s limo and walks toward it.</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: … Miss Rachel Marron!</p>
<p><strong>m.c.</strong>: Everyone wishes you the best tonight,
Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: Hello, Rachel. I need to get you straight on
your responsibilities.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Sure, Skip.</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: Now, it’s Best Sound, then another song, then
you. At precisely – 8:07, you’ll be presenting with Clive Healy. Those
are your lines. The prompter’s straight ahead and – we pray – working
perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: I understand it’s my great honor to escort
you onstage.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: That’s right, Clive. And I don’t like it one
bit that you look skinnier than me.</p>
<p><strong>patricia</strong>: … And the award for Best Achievement in
Sound goes to Kay Colvin and Mychal Smith for Hot And Cold.</p>
<p><strong>kay</strong>: Thank you so much. I want to thank our
producers, Karen Golden and Ed Gorsuch, as well our sound crew – Richard
Goodman and Blair Forward. I’m too excited – but they’re the real
winners tonight. Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>michael</strong>: This is wonderful. This is like, the
happiest moment of my life. I’d like to thank our wonderful sound crew
for all the evenings and weekends they sacrificed, the incredible
wizards down at Distant Thunder Sound Studios, Roger and Greg for hiring
us and my family for being so patient. We did it! Thank you!</p>
<p><strong>192 int. green room - night 192</strong>: The celebrities in
the Green Room drink, eat and talk. Rachel is deep in a giggling,
girlish conversation with another actress. Skip Thomas approaches Rachel
again.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I’m going to have a look around. I’ll come
back for her. Stay alert.</p>
<p><strong>193 int. backstage area - night 193</strong>: Frank moves
down the hall from the Green Room toward the stage. Stagehands,
technicians, performers speak in hushed tones. TV monitors are mounted
throughout the area. On screen a distinguished-looking actor named
REARDON is serving as temporary master of ceremonies. Frank walks along,
checking the route, looking up into the flies. He rounds a corner and is
face to face with Portman.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Portman. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: I’m on the job.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Him.</p>
<p><strong>reardon</strong>: My mother has always thought I was the star
of every movie I’ve been in. You remember ‘Night Of The Stranger’?</p>
<p><strong>reardon</strong>: You probably don’t remember me in that. My
mother can tell you about it. To this day, she thinks it’s about a desk
clerk at the hotel where what’s-his-name is hiding out from the
cops.</p>
<p><strong>reardon</strong>: Now it’s time to hear the final nominated
song, from the film ‘Queen Of The Night’ – ‘I Have Nothing.’ And here to
sing it for us, the multi-talented Miss Sandra Castle!</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Short-term gig… but quite profitable…
Listen, Frank, I’m sorry about Miami. You know, nothing really happened…
I felt bad for you… I wanted to say something, but you disappeared…</p>
<p>****: “I Have Nothing” fanfare. Dancers onto stage. First section of
song, commencing with shortened chorus then first verse Reardon walks
off the stage ten feet from where Frank and Portman are standing,
glances at them and moves off down the hall.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Back to work. I’ll probably see you at the
Governor’s Ball.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s face</strong>: suddenly wary. No rational cause.
Something in the air.</p>
<p><strong>194 int. green room - night 194</strong>: Rachel’s face as
she watches Sandra Castle on the monitor. She is at a makeup table.
MUSIC is LOUD. The celebrities in the Green Room are impressed with
Sandra’s performance. There is spontaneous applause. Rachel turns to the
room.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I want that broad run out of town.</p>
<p><strong>195 int. backstage - night 195</strong>: Frank calls Tony on
his SURV-KIT.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tony, you there?</p>
<p>****: Yeah, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tony, I’ve got a feeling this is the night. I
think he’s gonna go for her in front of all the cameras. The kind of
thing only a lunatic would do. That’s how he wants it to look. Except he
isn’t a lunatic. He’s very clever. I need you to help me.</p>
<p>****: I’m with you, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: You can’t use that thing back here. The
breakthrough’s killing our radio mikes… We’ll have to disconnect
you.</p>
<p><strong>195a</strong>: Tony fiddles with his earpiece.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Frank?… Frank?</p>
<p><strong>195b montage 195b</strong>: Big finish of song and dance
number . Applause and dancers off.</p>
<p><strong>196 int. green room - night 196</strong>: Frank walks past
Tony. Tony holds up the earpiece in frustration. Frank nods. He walks
over to Rachel. He seems tense and she senses it. And like a tangible
thing, his anxiety is passed over to her. She is frightened.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: What’s wrong?</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: Rachel… Clive. Let’s go, okay?</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: Really. Must we have everyone? We have our own
men at the door.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tony stays.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yes! I want him.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Come, Rachel, let us brighten the
firmament.</p>
<p><strong>197 int. backstage area - night 197</strong>: The group moves
down the hall from the Green Room, past the stage right wings. Behind
the scenery to the back of the stage.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Try to relax, Rachel. I know you must be very
excited.</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: Rachel, you’ll go in there and Clive, you over
there. You’ll meet on the landing.</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: Watch your step going down. Someone spilled
some water.</p>
<p><strong>reardon</strong>: I used to have an outfit just like that…
And to present the Best Song award we have our debonair friend from
England and the lady who has everything – Clive Healy and Rachel
Marron!</p>
<p><strong>198 int. stage left - night 198</strong>: Frank swiftly
adjusts his position so he can still see the stage. As he does, he
glances under the scaffolding that supports the set.</p>
<p><strong>199 int. on stage - night 199</strong>: Rachel and Clive
reach the podium. Clive is all smiles. Rachel is trying, but is
obviously distracted.</p>
<p><strong>from behind them</strong>: As the applause dies away, we see
what they see: TV cameras, an orchestra in the pit, the huge audience,
and the bright glare of the lights. At the front of the podium is the
transparent plastic of the teleprompter; their lines can be clearly
seen, printed out and moving vertically.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Well, Rachel, I know that you only came
tonight to present this award and you’ll want to leave as soon as we’re
done.</p>
<p><strong>rachel’s pov - bright red light</strong>: on the nearest TV
camera. The teleprompter, now showing Clive’s lines. The light. A man in
the first row of the audience. CLOSE ON HER HANDS as they squeeze the
cross.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Over the course of the evening we’ve heard
five smashing songs and the names of the artists who created them.</p>
<p><strong>200 int. stage left - night 200</strong>: Frank, watching
Rachel, hears the barely audible CLICKING start from the tiny receiver
on his belt. He’s puzzled. His eyes dart to Rachel’s hand and he sees
the cross. He knows what she’s going through. Her hand is shaking</p>
<p><strong>201 int. on stage - night 201</strong>: She sways. Clive
supports her as discreetly as he can, smiling out at the audience.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: And I know that no matter what anyone thinks,
you have no personal favorites.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: The Best Song nominees are: “Clock On The
Wall” from ‘The Dining Room Table’ – By Dana S. Lee and Sara Spring.
‘Give Me Your Trust’ from ‘Out Of the Gloom’ – By David Siegel and
Barbara G. Gordon. “I Have Nothing” from ‘Queen Of The Night’ – By Nancy
Garbor. “Maybe Soon” from ‘Maybe Soon’ – Anne Trop and Ben Glass. And
“Reflections Of My Heart” from ‘Hot And Cold’ – By Leslie Moraes.</p>
<p><strong>rachel’s pov</strong>: An usher near the wall shifts his
weight. The orchestra conductor turns to look at her. A musician turns
his sheet music. The dark at the back of the balcony. The
teleprompter.</p>
<p><strong>close on frank</strong>: as he alone hears the CLICKING –
monitors her distress and fear.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: All right, Clive, let’s find out –</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: – let’s find out who the winner is.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: The envelope. Rachel, shall I do the
honors?</p>
<p><strong>rachel’s face</strong>: watching. The CLICKING is almost
deafening – like a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>the clock</strong>: The second hand ticks in enormous
CLOSEUP. It’s 8:07.</p>
<p><strong>202 insert - enormous closeup - man’s finger 202</strong>: on
a trigger.</p>
<p><strong>203 insert - enormous closeup - a bullet 203</strong>: drifts
lazily towards us out of the muzzle of a gun in ultra SLOW MOTION.</p>
<p><strong>204 insert - - hands 204</strong>: bring out one of the
pasted-up death threats with the familiar opening lines – ’MARRON BITCH
– YOU HAVE</p>
<p><strong>close</strong>: as Clive pulls the card out of the envelope.
It reads:</p>
<p><strong>“i have nothing”</strong>: Music by</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: And the winner is “I Have Nothing”</p>
<p><strong>nancy garbor</strong>: This is so exciting. I can’t begin to
describe what it feels like to stand here – with this!</p>
<p><strong>nancy garbor</strong>: First, I want to thank Rachel Marron.
Without her support, encouragement and determination to help get an
unknown songwriter heard, I wouldn’t be standing here. A lot of people
talk about how they’re going to help others once they make it
themselves, but Rachel really follows through. I’d also like to thank
Helen Pollak, a wonderful producer, who never got fed up with me.</p>
<p><strong>205 int. off stage left - night 205</strong>: Frank sees
Rachel run off the opposite side of the stage and heads over there,
around the back of the scenery.</p>
<p><strong>206 int. on stage - night 206</strong>: Clive, the
professional, stands holding the envelope. He glances off after Rachel,
mystified.</p>
<p><strong>207 int. stage right wings - night 207</strong>: A cluster of
people surround Rachel, comforting her. Frank comes up. He does not try
to force his way through to Rachel. People begin to move away, the
cluster thins. Two stars move off toward the back of the stage.</p>
<p><strong>star #1</strong>: I always said she was nuts. I’ve always
said that.</p>
<p><strong>clive</strong>: Is she all right?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Christ, what an idiot I am. Jesus. What the
hell’s the matter with me?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Farmer, you’ve made me a raving lunatic.</p>
<p><strong>reardon</strong>: I have to go back out. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you for your help, John. I’m fine.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Where’s Portman?</p>
<p><strong>reardon</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Portman.</p>
<p><strong>reardon</strong>: Never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>208 int. green room - night 208</strong>: Rachel sits at a
makeup table. Skip Thomas approaches, clipboard in hand.</p>
<p><strong>skip</strong>: Rachel, I’m sorry, but if you’re going to be
in your seat for the Best Actress award, you’ve got to do it now.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Skip, I’m moving as fast as I can. For
chrissake, go twitch somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: Honey, everything’s fine. No one noticed
anything. Everybody in this building is ready to jump out of their skin
from nerves.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Bullshit, you saw me. Farmer’s made me a
raving lunatic –</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Something’s going on you should know about
–</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: You’re making her crazy. You’re making us
all crazy.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Rachel, I know who it is. He’s here tonight.
I think he’s…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Shut up…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Shut up, you maniac! You never stop. Now
you’ve made an ass of me in front of a billion people. And you won’t
quit.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tony, it’s Portman. Remember? The guy from
Miami…</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: After tonight, you’re back in charge.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>spector</strong>: He knows nothing about show business.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: You are an asshole.</p>
<p><strong>209 int. onstage - night 209</strong>: Reardon is just
introducing TOM WINSTON, the actor who will announce the Best Actress
award.</p>
<p><strong>best actress intro</strong>: material Reardon intros Winston.
Play on</p>
<p><strong>reardon</strong>: Presenting the Best Actress award, we have
the man who last year received the top honor an actor can achieve for
his performance in “South Of Waco”. Ladies and gentlemen, Tom
Winston!</p>
<p><strong>applause</strong>: Frank watches, his eyes scanning,
searching the vast theatre, squinting as he tries to see beyond the
glare of the klieg lights and the cameras.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Thank you, John, thank you, Academy.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: on stage, speaking and then listing the
nominees.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov - rachel, devaney and spector</strong>: in their
seats, up the aisle toward the back of the theatre, high into the gloom
of the balcony.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: Tonight we give this award not to the best
actress, but to the best performance by one of five exquisitely talented
artists…</p>
<p><strong>on screen</strong>: Rachel’s face, expectant, nervous on the
screen.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov - the path</strong>: Rachel would have to take to
the stage, the steps to the stage, the faces of the ushers near the
stage, the conductor, ready to play theme music.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: …And the nominees for best performance by
an actress in a leading role are – Constance Simpson for Hot and
Cold…</p>
<p><strong>back to scene</strong>: APPLAUSE. Frank slips through the
curtained doorway that leads to the backstage.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: …Ellen Pearson for Maybe Soon…</p>
<p><strong>211 int. backstage - stage right wings - night 211</strong>:
Frank comes up swiftly. He stops behind a curtain, six feet from the
path the winner will take. Tony is there. Frank speaks to him and, as he
does, he puts a hand on Tony’s arm. They both look across the stage,
past Winston into the wings on the other side.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: In the wings of the opposite side of
the stage, half hidden by a curtain, a TV cameraman is hoisting his
lightweight portable camera onto his shoulder. His back is to us.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: … Rachel Marron for Queen Of The Night…</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Tony, I want you on the other side… and check
out that guy. He’s not supposed to be there…</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: The cameraman half-turns toward us,
peering past the curtain into the audience. For a split second, we
glimpse his face. It’s Portman. Then someone crosses quickly in front of
him and he’s gone.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: L.C. Dean for I Dream Of Peace …and Evelyn
Gardner for The Harper Plan…</p>
<p><strong>backstage</strong>: Frank draws his gun. He glances quickly
to Tony, but Tony’s already on his way, trotting round the labyrinth
behind the set. Frank automatically raises his sleeve to call to Tony,
then realizes his communications are useless. He tries to see where
Portman has disappeared to, but he daren’t lose sight of Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>winston</strong>: And the winner is… Rachel Marron for Queen
Of The Night.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s face</strong>: grim. He looks past the curtain to
Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov - auditorium</strong>: Deafening applause in the
main auditorium. A stunned Rachel stands. Devaney and Spector kiss her.
People nearby reach out to touch her. Rachel walks along her row. The
orchestra plays “I Have Nothing.”</p>
<p><strong>212 int. backstage - opposite wings - night 212</strong>: A
mass of drapes and flats. Behind them, the cameraman is fixing something
to the side of his camera. His back is to us. Tony comes up briskly
behind him, unable to see his face.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Hey! You! What the fuck you think you’re doin’
back here…</p>
<p><strong>213 int. backstage - stage right wings - night 213</strong>:
Frank gestures animatedly to the head of security and several guards.
The music and the applause drown out his words and we do not hear them.
The guards rush off backstage and into the auditorium.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: As Rachel reaches the center aisle and
starts to walk toward the steps, there in the far aisle, his face almost
hidden, is Portman – the camera, hand-held on his shoulder, moving level
with Rachel, 20 feet behind her.</p>
<p><strong>aisle</strong>: Rachel walks down the aisle toward the side
steps. Tears in her eyes. Thunderous applause. Security guards in the
side aisles look around in all directions. They can’t see anything.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: TIGHT ON Portman, now almost completely
obscured behind the members of the audience, as more and more of them
stand to applaud Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>portman’s pov</strong>: ALONG THE SIDE OF THE CAMERA. Rachel
keeps appearing and disappearing behind the heads of the audience.</p>
<p><strong>frank in the wings</strong>: Desperate to get a clear shot at
Portman but unable to fire without hitting a bystander.</p>
<p><strong>from stage right wings - frank’s pov of rachel</strong>: as
she approaches the podium, steadily, controlling herself as she mounts
the steps. The outline of her body becomes difficult to see against the
glare of the foot- lights and the lights at the side of the
auditorium.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s face</strong>: His eyes squint against the
dazzle.</p>
<p><strong>on stage - podium</strong>: Rachel approaches Winston. The
applause and music is</p>
<p><strong>frank’s face</strong>: He can’t see Portman past the glare.
He can’t fire into the audience. He knows Rachel is now at her most
vulner- able. There is only one thing he can do to protect his
charge.</p>
<p><strong>backstage wings</strong>: Frank runs on stage at terrific
speed and leaps through the air at Rachel, twisting his body as he
does.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>close on portman</strong>: The silenced PISTOL taped to the
side of the camera FIRES.</p>
<p><strong>on stage</strong>: Frank and Rachel tumble over on the floor.
The podium topples. There are screams from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>auditorium</strong>: Pandemonium breaks out. Men run on stage
from all directions. Guns are drawn. Everyone is shouting. TV cameras
whip-pan in all directions, security men shout into walkie-talkies.</p>
<p><strong>215 int. mobile tv control van - night 215</strong>: Chaos on
all screens.</p>
<p><strong>tv director</strong>: What the fuck?</p>
<p><strong>other voice</strong>: Go to commercial…</p>
<p><strong>217 int. stage - night 217</strong>: Dozens more helpers pour
onto the stage around Frank and Rachel. Rachel starts to rise on all
fours and sees, as hands reach out to help her, the blood on Frank’s
shirt. He has taken the hits for her. But he’s still on the job, gaze
alert. Without taking his eyes from the audi- torium, his left arm
stretches out, with some pain, to push Rachel back down. The right arm,
gun in hand, sweeps the auditorium. Where is Portman? Frank can’t see
past the mob. Ushers fall on Frank in a heap, trying to disarm him.
Security men try to pull them off. Rachel shouts, trying to make herself
heard above the noise.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He’s my bodyguard. Get off him! He’s
O.K…</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov - series of shots</strong>: A SERIES of SWIFT LOW
ANGLE SHOTS through legs and faces. One brief glimpse that could be
Portman. A cameraman turns. It’s not. Frank is desperate, pushing away a
helping arm. The chaos mounts. SIRENS WAIL outside.</p>
<p><strong>close on portman</strong>: He turns away from the stage as
four cops pound past him. He walks away. Suddenly, for one brief second,
his face loses its composure as he looks to the side door.</p>
<p><strong>portman’s pov</strong>: Hysterical audience members jostle
for the exit, screaming and shouting. It’s like a football scrum. Cops
and secur- ity men pushing and pulling. His escape route is blocked.</p>
<p><strong>close on frank’s face - his eyes</strong>: Briefly glimpsed
through blurred, frenzied, f.g. Still seeking his target, biting his lip
in pain.</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Frank! Frank! Over here!</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Against the side wall at the front,
Portman’s eyes desperately scan for the source of the voice. He sees
Tony, his pistol takes aim.</p>
<p><strong>frank’s pov</strong>: For a split second, two running figures
f.g. pass and cross leaving a momentary clear line to Portman.</p>
<p><strong>on stage</strong>: Frank FIRES. ONCE. TWICE.</p>
<p><strong>portman</strong>: Frank’s bullets hit home. The first slams
Portman in the chest, knocking him against the wall. The second hits the
CAMERA on his shoulder, EXPLODING it around his face.</p>
<p><strong>female academy member</strong>: Blood spatters her white
Armani dress and the shirt- front of her escort. Portman’s body slumps
forward in her lap, pinning her back in her seat. He’s dead. His pistol
drops onto a pair of shiny, black leather pumps.</p>
<p><strong>on stage</strong>: Frank holds his aim steady, reluctant to
look away. He half turns to Rachel, wincing with the effort. She’s
unhurt. He has fulfilled his promise to her. Rachel throws her arms
around Frank and hugs him, tears streaming down her cheeks.</p>
<p><strong>angle on part of crowd</strong>: Police and paramedics
surrounding a man on a stretcher – it is Frank – Rachel walks at his
side, clutching his hand as he is rushed to an ambulance. Tony, a
dressing over his eyes, is also helped out by paramedics. Among the
gathered crowd, we focus in on one face. It is Dan, pushed back to the
sidelines and unable to see what is happening. He slowly turns and walks
away. CAMERA CRANES to a HIGH WIDE SHOT of the scene.</p>
<p><strong>221 ext. airplane tarmac - day 221</strong>: A buffed-out
charter turboprop stands on the tarmac as the last pieces of equipment
of Rachel’s band are loaded aboard from a truck. A limousine pulls up
and Rachel gets out with Tony and Court, who is clearly acting as her
bodyguard. She greets some members of the band and others who will be
part of her entourage. A roadie has her luggage removed from the limo
and loaded aboard the plane. Devaney is trying to hurry her on board.
Spector is conspicuous by his absence. As Rachel and the others prepare
to get onto the plane, Tony, wearing a dark leather eyepatch, reacts to
something O.S. Frank approaches from the nearby parking area. He is
pale. Under his clothes it can be seen that his torso is still taped. He
smiles as Tony. Their handshake becomes a quick abrazo.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: How’s it going?</p>
<p><strong>tony</strong>: Under control. But it won’t be the same… ya
mutt.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You shouldn’t be here.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: So, you’re quitting show business?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Too bad. You had talent. What are you going
to do?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I thought I might hole up with my dad. Finish
that chess game.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Get him when Fletcher’s not around.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: That’s the idea.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: So, how’s the new guy?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: He’s got white hair, Frank.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: He’s very good.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Why’d you have to get me an old man?</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I don’t trust you.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Yeah… well, give me a kiss and let’s get
this over with.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: ’Bye Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>222 int. plane - day 222</strong>: Rachel takes a seat beside
Fletcher. Devaney leans over the aisle.</p>
<p><strong>devaney</strong>: That wasn’t so bad. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>223 int. cockpit - day 223</strong>: The pilot’s hand pushes
forward on the throttle.</p>
<p><strong>224 ext. plane - day 224</strong>: The nosewheel starts to
taxi. The plane moves forward.</p>
<p><strong>225 int. plane - day 225</strong>: Rachel’s face at the
window.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Wait…</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Remember when you said you’d risk your life
for me?</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: I didn’t really believe it then. Nobody
means what they say. But you did, Frank. You did it. You laid it all on
the line for me.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Don’t wreck this for me. I don’t want to
hear any bullshit about you just doing your job. You did more than save
my life, Frank. You showed me a way to be. And I love you for it. There,
I said it. I’ll never forget what it felt like to be under your eye.
Never.</p>
<p><strong>frank</strong>: I won’t be forgetting you either.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Here… I want you to keep this. If you ever
need me, you just put this on and no matter where you are I will find
you. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>on frank</strong>: as the engines roar and the plane turns to
taxi out.</p>
<p><strong>227 ext. concert - night 227</strong>: Rachel’s face in FULL
FRAME, bathed in light and the applause of a huge audience.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Thank you… Thank you… Now I want to sing you
an old song, but it’s a new favorite.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: You know, this song used to make me feel
sad… But it doesn’t anymore.</p>
<p><strong>rachel</strong>: Now it just reminds me of someone very
special… This is for him.</p>
<p><strong>228 int. clermont hotel - night 228</strong>: It is a Rotary
Dinner. The CAMERA TRACKS ALONG the front of the head table which runs
from one side of the room to the other.</p>
<p><strong>rotary president</strong>: Our speaker this evening, the
honorable congressman from the fifth district, Galen Windsor, has been a
lone, courageous, voice… he alone has challenged those who have linked
organized crime with legitimate business throughout our state.</p>
<p><strong>rotary president</strong>: But first our benediction will be
delivered by Reverend Phillip Hardy of the First Presbyterian
Church.</p>
<p><strong>reverend hardy</strong>: Heavenly Father, please bless us
today as we meet in friendship and duty.</p>
<p><strong>reverend hardy</strong>: And Lord, whatever dangerous
endeavors those among us may take, let them never be without your
sanctuary.</p>
<p><strong>reverend hardy</strong>: … For all we know in our hearts that
even though we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you
are with us… guiding and protecting us. Amen.</p>
<p><strong>229 int. concert - night 229</strong>: Rachel ends a phrase.
She dabs at the corner of her eye as she continues the song that still
binds them together.</p>
<p><strong>very close on frank</strong>: His expression, so intense in
the opening scene of the film, is softer now. Rachel’s voice continues
as Frank carefully scans the room.</p>
