<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called
us.</p>
<p><strong>kasimov</strong>: I don’t remember what happened! We were at
the bar, drinking, laughing – having fun.</p>
<p><strong>kasimov</strong>: I don’t even know how I got here. I swear,
Anatoly, I never touched her! I didn’t lay a finger on her.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Kasimov. Don’t flounder.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Jesus, she’s been under too long. Come on,
come on!</p>
<p><strong>kasimov</strong>: You’re the only one who can help me.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: C’mon, c’mon, tell the truth…c’mon.</p>
<p><strong>kasimov</strong>: They’ll kill me.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: You asked for my help. You asked for my
help…come on…</p>
<p><strong>kasimov</strong>: You’re right, of course.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The name pal…give us the name.</p>
<p><strong>kasimov</strong>: The contact in Minsk..the contact in
Minsk..works in a travel agency.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p><strong>kasimov</strong>: His name is…..Dimitri Miediev.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Dimitri Miediev…Dimitri Miediev…</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Got him.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: Now, we drink.</p>
<p><strong>anatoly</strong>: To friends.</p>
<p><strong>kasimov</strong>: Yes, Anatoly, yes.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Get rid of this scum.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Did we get it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We got it. On your feet.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I want to sleep. Can I sleep here.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Walk, just walk. Start walking.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m walking.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Talking’s good, walking’s better.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Sleeping’s better.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Are you all right Ethan. What’s wrong with
you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: If you’re gonna do this again Claire, It’s
not gonna be on my watch.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Oh yeah?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Claire.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just waiting for you, tubs.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off at
our cruising altitude of thirty-eight thousand feet-and we should be
arriving in Prague right on schedule.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Would you like to watch a movie Mr
Rosen?</p>
<p>****: Would you like to watch a movie Mr Phelps?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: No, I prefer the theatre.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Would you consider the cinema of
the Ukraine?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Perhaps you’d choose one for me.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Phelps. The man you’re
about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn –</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: – a former KGB Line X officer now working
the international black market selling intelligence. This morning, we
learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half of a CIA NOC list, the list of
our non- official cover agents working in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: For security reasons, the NOC list is
divided into two encoded halves. Golitsyn already has the cryptonym
portion, which contains agent code names and targeting areas. This
portion is useless unless combined with the second half – the true name
list that is kept in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the
true name list at an Embassy function tomorrow night. Your mission,
should you decide to accept it, is to obtain photographic proof of the
theft, apprehend those involved, and return the stolen list. I don’t
have to stress the importance of this matter, Jim. We’re keeping it
internally black. Because of its urgency, I’ve already sent to Prague a
team selected from your usual group.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Ethan Hunt will of course be your point
man, as usual. He’s in Kiev; we’re getting word to him now.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: As always, should you or any member of
your IM force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all
knowledge of your actions. This tape will self- destruct in five
seconds. Good luck, Jim!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Look to your right, then back to me. There’s a
camera built right into the bridge. Whatever you see it sees and
transmits it back here. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Of course I can hear you.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: No, in your…ear piece. You have a lovely smile
. Can you hear me now?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: What’s going on?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Why don’t you take a look?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jack…that’s spying.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: That’s what we do isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jack you’re so wicked.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Too wicked to have a drink later?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I think I might just take that look.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yeah, well, Jim, fact is I’ve got more than
ninety days leave coming.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: A hundred and sixty-seven, I think it is.
Take it all, if you want. After this one.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I thought I’d take some now.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: What the hell’s made you decide to take your
leave at the worst possible time? Claire’s in a weird mood too.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Oh? What’s the problem?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: I don’t know, I had to go to Chicago again.
You were in Kiev. You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Tell you what?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: When you started noticing your short term
memory loss. What the problem was you and Claire had in Kiev?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What problem?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Ah, God, forget it. What are we talking
burnout here?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Ethan, you can’t burn out.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Because I can’t afford it. And because you’d
burn up before you’d burn out.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: How was Chicago?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Wonderful. Ran into a convention of auto
dealers at the Drake Hotel. You hear the one about the astronaut who
comes back from the first manned flight to Mars after two years? His
wife’s got a year old kid. So he says “All right. Who was it? My friend
Harry?” She says no. “Oh, it was my friend Sammy.” She says it wasn’t
Sammy. “Oh, I suppose it was my friend Lou.” “No, what’s the matter,
don’t you think I have any friends of my own?!”</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Boy, you really are grim. Come here, take a
look.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Beyond Charles Bridge there is our Embassy.
See it? Tomorrow night, if anything goes wrong, this guy will steal the
names of our agents in every country all over Eastern Europe. Up for
grabs to the highest bidders – third world terrorists, arms dealers,
drug lords – any and everybody who’d love to get rid of long term
coverts like us, and some very dear friends among them. If they’re
exposed, they’ll be executed. Come over here. Take a lock at this.</p>
<p><strong>senator waltzer</strong>: I’ll go you one further. I say the
CIA and all its shadow organizations have become irrelevant at best and
unconstitutional at worst. It’s time we throw a little light on the
whole concept of the Pentagon’s “black budget.” These covert agency
subgroups have confidential funding, they report to no one – who are
these people?! We were living in a democracy the last time I
checked.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’re going to use Walter?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: He’s our guy.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Isn’t he chairing the Armed Services
hearing?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Not this week. This week he’s flyfishing at
the Oughterard Slough in County Kildare, with one of our best Irish
guides.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: He won’t be back in a hurry?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: No, not in a hurry. What do you think? You
think the plot’ll work?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Sure. If the main character does.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: If you were me, Ethan, who would you trust
to make him believable?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Sorry, am I interrupting?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Stick of gum. If you come up against a lock
you can’t pick –</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Red light. Green light. Mash them together,
asta lasagna. Don’t get any on you – you have five seconds.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Are you gonna take it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Give me the God damn gum.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Just don’t chew it.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Ethan. Jack’s inside. Window’s open by
twenty-three hundred.</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: How do you do, Senator, I’m Rand Housman,
the Ambassador’s aide. If I could just steer you through the reception
line here –</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the
director of the National Gallery – Petr Brandl, the mayor of Prague
–</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: I bet you don’t remember me, do you,
Senator?</p>
<p><strong>senator waltzer</strong>: Of course I do. How are you, Miss
Norman?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: He’s in pocket. Under the archway behind
me.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Sarah, mark the package and go to two.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Your advance team mentioned you’d want a tour
of the facility, so I’ve gone ahead and set that up for you –</p>
<p><strong>senator waltzer</strong>: Terrific. Let’s get going. Will you
excuse us?</p>
<p><strong>diplomat</strong>: Uh, sir?</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Great. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Hannah. He’s marked. Lets go.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: En route.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Hannah, pull the shade .</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Governor’s in position. We have the
elevator.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Excuse me, can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: – which leads directly to the Denied Area,
the only limited access area in the whole facility.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: As you can see. this area has both a Marine
guard and video surveillance, and is strictly monitored at all
times.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Senator, don’t you have a young man on your
staff named JACK?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Jack? I believe we did have a young man named
Jack. Not a reliable man, as I recall. Constantly late or behind in his
work.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Excuse me, let me see that ID again!</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Jack’s pinned down Sarah. Should be a
second. Keep dancing.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We were forced to tie him to my best stallion
and drag him around the barn a few times.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Relax your crack, Foghorn, I’m workin’ on
it.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Oh. Sorry, sir.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: The drink with Sarah is definitely off.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Hannah – I’m blind again. Hannah.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: He’s heading to the denied area.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Higher. Higher.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Higher.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Right, right. Good.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Get moving, Ethan. He’s rolling to you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Jack we’re in position.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Jack. Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I didn’t touch it.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: He’s in the box, Ethan, he’s in the box!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: OK. Taking Golitsyn’s exit. Jack, open the
doors.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: What about my coat? I’ll freeze.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I don’t have it.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Opening the doors. Go under.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: He’s got it. Saved your ass again Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Give me a break, Pops.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Such a nice ass.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: And a lonely ass.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Sarah’s reconsidering. Claire, transport in
five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Roger that.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: In position. Jack open the door, let the
package roll.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Roger that. Opening doors now.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Stairway, you�re wrapped, go to
transport.</p>
<p><strong>hannah</strong>: En route.</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Jack, what are you doing?!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: I�m not doing anything! .</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: I don�t have it – I don�t have control!</p>
<p><strong>jack</strong>: Uh – then I have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Cut the power. Cut the power Jack. Do you
hear me.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Come on, Jack, come on.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Jack. Jack.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Man down. Stay where you are. I�m on my
way.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: En route.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: The package is in the open.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Jim. Jim. He�s in the open.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: I�ve got a shadow.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Can you lose him?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: No. Abort.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Ethan. He�s out of pocket.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Jim we can�t.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Abort. That�s an order.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Negative, Golitsyn�s on the move.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: No, damn it, no, I said ABORT!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Sarah eye on the package. Jim, I�m coming to
you.</p>
<p><strong>sarah</strong>: Jim gave an abort, we should walk away.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No, we�re going to recover the disk,
understand?! Now move!</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: About two hundred yards from the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: They�re covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut
all radio communications. Repeat. Cut all radio communications.</p>
<p><strong>flat voice</strong>: Satcom seven.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Central Europe. Unsecured.</p>
<p><strong>flat voice</strong>: Designator?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Bravo Echo one one.</p>
<p><strong>flat voice</strong>: Switching.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: This is Kittridge.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Go secure.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: They�re dead.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Who�s dead?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: My team. Claire, Jack, even Jim - - Hannah,
maybe, I – don�t know</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Are you damaged?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: They knew we were coming. Golitsyn�s dead
too. The disk is gone.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Are you intact?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Do you read me? The list is in the open!</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Let’s just bring you in safely, and then
we’ll worry about that, okay? Were you followed?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don�t think so.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Don�t think, be sure. Are you clean?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Location green. One hour. I�ll be there
myself.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You�re in Prague?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Heard a lot about you, Hunt. Don�t
disappoint me.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No sir.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: One hour.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: I can’t tell you how sorry I am. I know
how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan. Personally as well as
professionally.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Passport, visas - you know the drill.
We’ll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley. Throw
the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects. Follow
me?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yeah. I follow you.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: We’ve lost enough agents for one
night.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You mean I’ve lost enough agents for one
night.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: You seem hell bent on blaming yourself,
Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Who else is left?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Yes. I see your point.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Why was there another team?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: I don’t quite follow you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Let’s see if you can follow me around this
room. The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o’clock…The couple
waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah
at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o’clock. The other IMF team.
You’re worried about me. Why?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: You’re right. Maybe this’ll save some
time.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: For a little over two years now we’ve
been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations. We have a penetration.
The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know
as “Max.”</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: The arms dealer.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: That’s right. Max, it seems, has two
unique gifts – a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible
agents. This time he’s gotten to someone on the inside - he’s put
himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to
as “Job 314”. The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Correct the actual list is safe at
Langley. “Golitsyn” was a lightning rod, one of ours.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: This whole operation was a molehunt.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Yes, the mole’s deep inside. And – like
you said. You survived.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: I want to show you something, Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Since your father’s death, your family’s
farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they’re flush with
over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad’s illness was supposed
to have wiped out the bank account – dying slowly in America after all,
can be a very expensive proposition Ethan. So, why don’t we go quietly
out of here onto the plane…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: How about if we just go quietly into the
bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down
bureaucratic asshole.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Ethan, I can understand you’re very
upset.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Kitteridge, you’ve never seen me very
upset.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: All right, enough is enough Hunt. You’ve
bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on intimate loyalties to get away
with it. You’re determined to shake hands with the devil and I’m going
to make sure you do it in hell.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Job. Job 3:14. March fourteen. Job 31
March.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Job three fourteen. Job – It’s Job!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Max – Goods tainted. Consider extremely
hazardous. DO NOT USE. Fate will be that of kings and counsellors who
built for themselves palaces now lying in ruins. Must meet to discuss
a.s.a.p.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Ethan, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: I needed you, Ethan. 1 needed you on the
bridge, and – you weren’t there. Ethan? Ethan?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What are you doing here?!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ethan – Ethan, it’s okay. It’s Claire. Ethan
what’s wrong with you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Don’t move.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You were in the car!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I wasn’t. I heard that Jim was in trouble on
the radio. He said someone was…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Shut up! I saw you. You were in the car.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No, I got out of the car and I ran to the
bridge.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Don’t give me that! I was on the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What happened to Jim?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: There was nobody on the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What happened to Jim?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Dead. Dead. Dead! Wake up, Claire! Jim’s
dead, they’re dead. They’re all dead!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: They’re dead. Jim’s dead.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Take off your coat.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Take off your God damn coat!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I walked away. He said abort. He was gone so
I walked away.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: That was four hours ago! Who sent you? Did
they send you here?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Who is “they?”</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Did they send you…Did they send you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Who is they, who is they?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Who sent you?! Who sent you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: No one sent me! We’re supposed to be back
here at four o’clock, four o’clock, if we abort, we don’t return here
until four o’clock, 0-four hundred, four am, four o’clock –!</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Why haven’t they brought us in yet?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’ve been disavowed. They think I killed Jim
and everyone else. Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into
my parents’ bank account. Kittridge assumes I’m a mole they’ve been
tracing and I’ve been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last
two years, to get him our NOC list.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m going to get it for him. Whoever the mole
is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can’t
find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he’ll find me.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ethan, you’re not making sense. Let me go in
and talk to Kittridge. I’m going to tell him you had nothing to do…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Claire, Claire, Claire, if you’re not dead,
he’s going to assume you’re with me.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: The message is for Job.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m going to answer it.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Excuse me, could I trouble you for a
match?</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: Would you remove your hat please?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: You wish to meet Max? This is the price of
admission.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I thought I was going to see Max.</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: You misunderstood. No one sees Max.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Then what am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: Allowing Max to see you and hear what
you’ve got to say.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I don’t communicate very well through a
shroud.</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: If Max doesn’t like what you have to say,
you’ll be wearing that shroud indefinitely.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m willing to take the chance.</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: Very well.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Who are you and what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I need one hundred thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Really? And you thought if you simply showed up
I might give it to you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty
five thousand.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The penny drops. You are not Job. Yes, Job is
not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its
tone – aggressive but playful. Job is not playful. So you’re something
of a paradox.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: That depends.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: On what?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Whether you like a paradox. I want a hundred
and fifty thousand dollars.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s quite out of the question.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: The disk Job sold you is worthless. It’s
bait, part of an internal molehunt.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: And how might you know that? Are you another
Company man?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Like Job?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ah, but, we’re asking about you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m NOC. Was. Now disavowed.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why, may I ask?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: That’s the question I want to ask Job.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t know Job any more than he knows me.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Even so, I’m sure you could arrange an
introduction.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Because I can deliver the actual NOC list.
The one you have is not only worthless, it’s certain to be equipped with
a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: It’s easy to say the disk is worthless when you
say I can’t look at the information and see if it’s worthless. Not a
tenable position, sir.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Okay, boot it up and in anywhere from thirty
seconds to ten minutes you’re gonna have Virginia farm boys hopping
around you like jackrabbits.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Mm - Hmmm…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Tell you what. How good’s the RF scanner you
used in the car?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Very good.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Okay, use it. But I suggest pack up
first.</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: Twenty-six, twenty-seven. So far so
good.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: That’s not so good for you, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: Thirty-two and change.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Doesn’t mean it’s a signal. Could just be the
hard drive heating up.</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: Forty-four. Forty-five.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’d say you’ve got about two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: Fifty-seven. Fifty-nine.</p>
<p><strong>female imf</strong>: Switch it on. Keep cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Oh dear, Gunther will never let me use one of
his apartments again. Phew, sorry I doubted you, dear boy. You’re a good
sport. Do accept the compliment.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Thanks, Max. Or is it Maxine?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I don’t have to tell you what a comfort
anonymity can be in my profession – like a warm blanket. My deal with
Job was subject to a successful boot scan. Obviously it didn’t pass
muster. Deal’s off.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What was your deal with Job?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Six million dollars. I’ll give you the same.
But I want the complete list now, not just Eastern Europe. I won’t do
this piecemeal, it’s too dangerous. I want the entire list, the true
name of every non-official cover agent throughout the world.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Ten million. Ten million in negotiable U.S.
Treasury certificates, in bearer form, coupons attached. And one more
thing – your personal assurance that Job will be at the exchange.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Done. Bring it to me in London. I want it by
the end of the week.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: How will you make sure Job will be there?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How will you make sure I’ll have the list in
three days? It’s been a delight. Now where can I drop you dear boy?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’m not being dropped anywhere without my
money.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m going to have to front you personally.
Don’t lose that money without losing your life.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I wouldn’t dream of it.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: The man’s gone black, Barnes. He’s under
until he decides to surface.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Look we can use someone from the Embassy and
we can get the local authorities involved. Close off his
transportation.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: What can we do, Barnes? Put a guy at the
airport? How many identities do you think Hunt has? How many times has
he slipped past custom, in how many countries? These guys are trained to
be ghosts. We taught them how to do it, for Christ’s sake!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: So what do you suggest?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Let’s not waste time chasing him. Make
him come to us. Everybody�s got pressure points. Find out something
that’s important to him personally and you squeeze.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Max made a deal with you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I deliver the NOC list, Max delivers Job.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: We’ve got seventy-five rounds for your Glock
9, but only twenty for the Sig Sauer, one pair of Visco glasses with
monitor, plenty of passports. You said it yourself – if I’m not dead,
I’m with you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’re sure about this?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Jim was my husband. I want to know who
killed him. I want to get the son of a bitch who did this.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We need help, and we don’t have time. They
have to be local.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What kind of help?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Simple game. Four players. Exfil opens the
pocket – – cyber ops lifts the wallet.</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: Bank?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: IMF mainframe.</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: Where exactly is it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: In Langley.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: In Langley? The one in Virginia,
Langley?</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: Inside CIA headquarters at Langley.</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: Is he serious?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Always.</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: If we’re going to Virginia, why don’t we
drop by Fort Knox? I can fly a helicopter right in through the lobby and
set it down inside the vault and it will be a hell of a lot easier than
breaking into the God damn CIA.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: What are we downloading?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Information.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: What kind?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Profitable.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Payment on delivery.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I don’t know. This I don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: This doesn’t sound like the Luther Stickell
I’ve heard of. What’d they used to call you? The Net Ranger? Phineas
Phreak? The only man alive who actually hacked NATO Ghostcom.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: There was never any physical evidence that I
had anything to do with that.. that.. With that exceptional piece of
work.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You don’t know what you’re missing. This is
the Mt. Everest of hacks.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You’re all kidding yourselves. Even with top
of the line crypto. Cray access. STU 3’s –</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Krieger can get it. Right?</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: May take a little time.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: May take a little time. That’s not what
Claire tells me about you.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Thinking Machine laptops, I’m talking about
the 686 prototypes – with the artificial intelligence Risk chip –</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: Twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: And I get to keep the equipment when we’re
done.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Luther, I guess you’re all out of
excuses.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I can’t just hack my way inside. There’s no
modem access to the mainframe, it’s in a stand-alone. I’d have to be
physically at the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Luther, relax, it’s worse than you think. The
terminal’s in black vault lock-down.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: They missed nothing in that room. Even the
vents have laser nets over them.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Inside, there are three countermeasure
systems that can only be deactivated by authorized entry. Which we won’t
have.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: The first system is sound-sensitive, anything
above a whisper sets it off. The second system is on the floor and
pressure-sensitive –</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: –and the third detects any increase in
temperature. Even the body heat of an unauthorized person in the room
will trigger it.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: All three systems are state of the art.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: And you really think we can do this.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: May I come in?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Sure…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: It’s cash. And a second passport. If anything
goes wrong when we’re inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation
don’t look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk
away.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You don’t think we’re going to make it.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I didn’t say that.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You didn’t have to………</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I just need you to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What about me - Jim called an abort - I
didn’t comply. I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I wish I’d never laid eyes on you..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: What I want to know is how Hunt accessed the
disavowed file, even after we cut off his authorization code.</p>
<p><strong>marek</strong>: He may have used Phelps’ code. They were
friends, and Phelps, was still valid for twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: If that’s the case, we need to implement a
system to immediately deactivate an agent’s code immediately…</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: I can’t believe what I’m listening to.
Hunt just kicked us in the ass, you guys are standing here trying to
figure out what kind of shoes he had on! I don’t care how he did it, I
want to know why he did it! Is he recruiting? For what purpose?</p>
<p><strong>lowden</strong>: Survival.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Too short sighted. This guy’s proactive,
he initiates. The question is what does he want now and where does he
need to get it and Barnes what the hell is that noise?!</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Fire alarm, Gene.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Oh, for – do we have to evacuate?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: That’s S.O.P..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We picked up alarms in sectors three, seven,
and twelve.</p>
<p><strong>guard richard</strong>: Yeah. That’s what I’ve got too.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What sector’s the air conditioning?</p>
<p><strong>guard randall</strong>: Uh – twenty-one, but there’s no alarm
in sector twenty-one.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I gotta go in there and shut it down!</p>
<p><strong>guard randall</strong>: Nobody goes into any sector where the
alarm didn’t go off.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Do you want to blow the fire through the
whole building?</p>
<p><strong>guard richard</strong>: Nobody goes into any sector where the
alarm did not go off –</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: –and it did not go off in twenty-one!</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Twenty-one, twenty-one –</p>
<p><strong>guard randall</strong>: Wait! Hold it - it’s on. Let’s
go.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Let’s move!</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Hi there.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Air conditioning’s through here!</p>
<p><strong>cia analyst</strong>: William Donloe.</p>
<p><strong>guard</strong>: Where’s the other guy?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Zero body count.</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Time up.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: 1 - 2 - 3 - Toast, toast. Luther, I’m going
in. Don’t disappoint me…Krieger, from here on in, absolute silence.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Type this password: AW96B6. Return. Go to
the files menu, find the NOC list file. Open “NOC List.” Put your
diskette in. Double click on the NOC list.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Ok, good! It’s scrolling. 0K, now we’re
going to download. Edit menu. Select “copy to disc”. You’re downloading.
When it’s all green it’s done.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Holy mother of God.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You’ve done it. Eject it.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: He’s rolling. Get moving!</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Get out of there – get out of there –</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: He’s at the vault - get moving! 1 yellow, 2
yellows…Toast!</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You’re not moving!</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Phew! NOC list.</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: Merci.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We’re not outta here yet.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Think, for Christ’s sake, you guys are
mired in detail, open your minds, it’s gotta be staring us in the face!
What does Ethan Hunt want?!</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Same thing he wanted in Prague! Same thing
he’s always wanted! The NOC list!</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Okay!</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: And where is the list vulnerable?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Other than here.</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: It’s for you.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Kittridge, yup?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: You and I know about this – and that’s
where it stops. Understand? It never happened.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: What about him…?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: I want him manning a radar tower in
Alaska by the end of the day. Just mail him his clothes.</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: You contacting your buyer? Ethan?</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: Ethan? Oh, ’scuse me Mr. Hunt?</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: You’re not going to any meeting without
me.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: My contact is extremely shy.</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: I don’t think you’re in any position to
give orders, do you? Not while I’m holding this.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Krieger.</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: Stay out of this.</p>
<p><strong>or</strong>: Lachez - moi</p>
<p><strong>or</strong>: T’agueue</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Don’t you mean this?</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: That’s not it. That’s not the list.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What’s the matter, you don’t know this
trick?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Where did it go?! It’s GONE!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: But not too far!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I know what you’re thinking, Krieger. You’re
thinking, back in the computer room – I was up here – he was down there
– . He was carrying two discs.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: So hard to keep track of these things.</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I thought you had it! Do you actually think
I’d let you have the NOC list?</p>
<p><strong>krieger</strong>: Try any sleight-of-hand with my money and
I�ll cut your throat.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m so sorry. Krieger was my call. I’ve
never worked with him. I’m sorry, Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We did what we had to do.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: I’m going to try and get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Krieger did have the NOC list.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Now I want you to hold onto it.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: What makes you trust me?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Because if you knew what you were getting
into, you never would have done it.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I’m not letting this list get out in the
open.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Exactly, that’s your job. Tomorrow on the
train, you can’t let this list get out into the open. What’s the range
of this thing?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: It’s hard to tell. I’m gonna have to be
close.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I’ll get you close.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ethan I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>anchor</strong>: The unlikely setting…a farm in the heartland
of America…the State of Wisconsin, where federal agents claim to have
broken the brain trust behind an international drug ring. For a report
we go live now to CNN correspondent in the state capitol, Madison.
…?</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Authorities have identified the couple as
Margaret Ethan Hunt and Donald Hunt.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Here they are now.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: They were apprehended this morning by the
DEA in a major sting operation for the illegal manufacture of the drug
methcathinone, known on the street as “cat”.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Similar to methamphetamines, cat is seen by
officials as one of the most powerful and dangerous drugs in the world.
Some thirty-four cat labs have been seized so far, but the recently
widowed Mrs. Hunt and her brother-in-law are believed to be involved in
a global drug distribution network.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: Mr. Fairchild, agent Fairchild, a comment
please.</p>
<p><strong>public official</strong>: I think it’s sad, really. Farmers,
unless they’re a conglomerate, are always operating on a paper-thin
margin. I’m afraid what we have here is a case of a naive and lonely
widow with a lot of financial problems who chose to make money through
illegal means.</p>
<p><strong>reporter</strong>: That was John Fairchild, the DEA agent in
charge of this investigation. Officials tell me that international law
enforcement agents are expected to arrive here later today to question
the Hunts. This is Joe Jones, CNN, Love in Madison, Wisconsin.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Kittridge…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Bastard!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Don’t…don’t touch me…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What are you going to do?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: He’s expecting my call. I’m going to the
station… And I’m going to call him.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Kittridge.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I see you’ve been out visiting the folks.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: It’s Hunt. What do you need for a
pinpoint? Been watching a little T.V., have you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Hauling Mom off to jail in shackles was an
especially nice touch.</p>
<p><strong>technician</strong>: He’s in England.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Get MI5.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Ethan, I want to reassure you that my
first order of business after you come in is to get these ridiculous
charges against your family dropped and eliminated completely from their
files. Come in now, we can plea down the charges against you as
well.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Can I ask you something, Kittridge?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Certainly Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: If you’re dealing with someone who’s crushed,
stabbed, shot and detonated five members of his own IMF team, how
devastated do you think you’re going to make him by marching Ma and
Uncle Donald down to the county courthouse?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: I don’t know, Ethan. Suppose you tell
me?</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Lost him. We needed three more seconds.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: He wanted us to know he was in
London.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: You’re a hard man to catch up with.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: ..the next day I managed to drag myself to
the safe house, must’ve just missed you..anyway, I checked our
aliases.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: - and picked us up in the States -</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: - but you left before I could get there and
I could check just so many places..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Yeah, smaller countries don’t computerize
customs records -</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: - so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in
England..it was easy.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool
Street.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Hey, I showed ’em to you!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I remember..</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Jim, who do you think you’re kidding? A
doctor’s gotta look at that. You can’t sit up straight.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: I can sit up straight. I just can’t..sit up
straight very well. It’s not important! I saw who shot me. Ethan, I saw
the mole. It was Kittridge. Kittridge!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Kitteridge. Oh my god! Kittridge is the
mole?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: How did Kittridge do it?..</p>
<p><strong>ethan vo</strong>: - first he took care of Jack in the
elevator -</p>
<p><strong>ethan vo</strong>: - he shot you on the bridge -</p>
<p><strong>ethan vo</strong>: - he must have had back up take out
Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence..</p>
<p><strong>ethan vo</strong>: How did he do Hannah?</p>
<p><strong>ethan vo</strong>: No. No. He could’ve taken out Hannah
himself.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Why, Jim? Why?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: ..when you think about it, Ethan, it was
inevitable..no more Cold War. No more secrets you keep from everyone but
yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself. Then one morning
you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running
the country - without your permission. The son-of-a- bitch! How dare he?
You realize it�s over, you�re an obsolete piece of hardware not worth
upgrading, you�ve got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year.
Kittridge, we�ll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: We don�t have to, Jim. He�ll come after
us.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: What�s going to make him do that?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What he didn�t get in Prague. The NOC
list.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Jesus, Ethan. Good for you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: A meeting tomorrow on the TGV, enroute to
Paris.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Tight security. No guns. Real plus.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: If I supposedly deliver the NOC list to Max,
Max has agreed to deliver Job to me. I�ll have Claire and Luther
Stickell with me on the train. Marcel Krieger will have helicopter
transport waiting in Paris.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Jim…?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and
suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe
house..alive and beautiful..and thinking I�m dead and gone. God knows
what she�s had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done,
I..</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: - no. She can�t know about me. No one can.
Not til this is over. There�s too much at stake, Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You�re probably right.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: I usually am.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Once we leave the safehouse, get in there and
crash. I�ll call you from Paris.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: And get a doctor.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I sent the message to Max. We�re on for
tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Okay…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Is this the only way?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes…….come here….viens pres moi…</p>
<p><strong>tgv. london terminus</strong>: Noon.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: How long to the London Terminus?</p>
<p><strong>agent</strong>: Twenty, twenty-five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: You�ve got ten. Move!</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: How long until we reach the Chunnel?</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: Twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: Yes… It�s him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: This wasn�t what we discussed.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: My apologies Max. Couldn�t be helped. There�s
a piece of black cloth under your seat. Tear it away and you�ll find the
disk.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Ha, dear boy! I do hope this doesn�t prelude a
meeting in private.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: It doesn�t, dear girl. as long as you tell me
where the money is.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: The possibility alone is worth ten million.
Baggage car, rack 3. Silver briefcase. Combination 314.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: What about Job?</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I wouldn�t worry about him. Once you�ve got the
money – he�ll find you.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Only four more cars.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: And if we don�t find him - we�ll search
the whole train again.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: What�s Hunt doing on the TGV?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: High speed train. No-one gets on. No- one
gets off. High security. Good place for a pass off to Max.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: But why tell us?</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: He�s putting on a show, Barnes.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: What kind of show.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: I don�t know. It didn�t say on the
tickets.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ethan…Kittridge is on the train.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Kittridge is Job. Max delivered. How far is
he from Luther?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Two cars. Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You are my eyes. Stay with him.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: He�s in the baggage car.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: I�ll be there.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: What�s the problem.</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: Connection denied.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Try it again.</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: It�s not working.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Is something wrong with the phone? Well is
something wrong with the batteries?</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: I always check the batteries.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Run it through from the top.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Nothing but civilians, Gene.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: This is bullshit - we don�t even know
what Max looks like.</p>
<p><strong>barnes</strong>: Maybe we don�t have to know what he looks
like. If he�s got that list, he�s going to want to check it. We should
be looking for laptops.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Good idea.</p>
<p><strong>waiter</strong>: Excuse me, Sir, your telephone…</p>
<p><strong>matthias</strong>: It�s working.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Phew! We�ve got five minutes…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I�ve got the money. Meet me in the baggage
car.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Get this door open.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Hello, Luther. Where�s Hunt?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Mr. Kittridge, the NOC list is being modemed
off the train.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ethan�s right behind me. Listen to me Jim.
Is it such a good idea to kill him? We take the money. Ethan takes the
blame. No-one else has seen you alive. No-one will believe him.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Of course - I�m sorry to hear you say that
Claire.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ethan?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Yes. Ethan Hunt, darling. Remember him?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: You knew about Jim?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Course he did. Just exactly when he knew is
something of a question. Before or after I showed in London, mind
telling me, Ethan?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Before London. But after you took the Bible
out of the Drake Hotel in Chicago.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: They stamped it, didn�t they? Those damn
Gideons.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Two minutes til Krieger shows. This�ll have
to be quicker than I�d like. Certainly quicker than you�d like.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Ethan, if you knew about Jim?..Why..</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Why the masquerade? Why take the risk? Well,
Claire, you�ve asked the question and you are the answer.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I knew about Jim.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: But, he didn�t know about you. In all
fairness, Ethan, Claire was never convinced her charms would work with
you. But I was supremely confident - having tastes the goods. “Thou
shall not covet thy Neighbour�s wife”, Ethan. Oh, Ethan is in love with
you, Claire, make no mistake about it. And like all the world�s lovers,
he�s tortured by the same, one pathetic question - “does she feel the
same way I do?”</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Well Claire do you? Have you been exploiting
his feelings or returning them?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Jim - lets just get the money and get out of
here.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: The money Ethan.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You�ve earned it.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Count it.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Tell me something Claire, that night in
Prague, was it you or Jim that blew up the car and scattered Hannah all
over town?</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Keep counting Claire.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It was me. I did it.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: All ten million.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Fold it. Fold it tight.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Aren�t you going to thank me Jim. Ten million
is better than six.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Don�t flatter yourself - six was for Eastern
Europe. You made a lousy deal - ten for the world? What is that? But I
needed you for the transfer with Max. I got a little extra change; and
you got a little extra too.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Sorry Ethan. Times up. Say goodbye.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You�re wrong about one thing. I�m not the
only one who�s seen you alive.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Good morning, Mr Phelps.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: You son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Don�t Jim.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Now we don�t have to eliminate him? You like
that, don�t you Claire? Don�t you?</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Jim, it�s over.</p>
<p><strong>phelps</strong>: Ethan - I�ve always taught you, nothing can
be more dangerous than the truth. It can kill you.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Claire…Hey…</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: This stuff is so sticky.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Claire.</p>
<p><strong>claire</strong>: It�s all right, Ethan..you�ll bring me
back…won�t you…</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: I always have, Claire..</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: Damn!</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: No, no, it’s IN the tunnel!</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Stop the train!</p>
<p><strong>conductor</strong>: It’ll crash into us! Accelerate,
accelerate.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Red light, green light. Asta Lasagna mother
fucker.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I think this is what you’re looking for.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: My lawyers will have a field day with this.
Entrapment, jurisdictional conflicts –</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: Maybe we’ll just keep the courts out of
this one.</p>
<p><strong>max</strong>: I’m sure we can find something I have that you
need.</p>
<p><strong>kittridge</strong>: You know, I would love to try.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Reach your folks? How they feeling?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: The official apology from the Justice
Department, the VIP treatment, you know, the whole nine yards.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well my Mother was a little confused about
how the DEA could mistake her and Uncle Donald for a couple of dope
smugglers in the Florida keys.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Here’s to you, Luther. To being off the
disavowed list.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Hey, I’m the flavour of the month!</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You’re more than that, Luther. They were
mistaken about you and they’re trying to show you they know it. They
want you back in.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Sure. They want me back in so I won’t break
in! They still can’t figure out how we did it.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: You didn’t tell ’em at the debriefing?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: I figured I’d let ’em reinstate my back pay,
give me a promotion, check out my office at Langley and then, maybe,
talk about it.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: It’s all one big negotiation, isn’t it?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Why don’t you come back with me?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Just don’t know why I’d be doing it.</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: You really liked Phelps, didn’t you?</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: He was a good guy for a long, long time. Just
- not long enough. Gotta catch my flight.. So. How’s it feel being a
solid citizen again?</p>
<p><strong>luther</strong>: Oh man…I don’t know. I’m gonna miss being
disreputable.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any
better I’ll always think of you that way.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Would you like to watch a movie,
Miss Clarke?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Hunt. Would you
like to watch a movie.</p>
<p><strong>ethan</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Would you consider the cinema of
the Caribbean?</p>
<p><strong>flight attendant</strong>: Aruba, perhaps?</p>
