<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: This is my Fredricksburg house and my
grandma Ruth playing with my skateboard ramp. It’s a Tony Hawk jump
ramp.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Mick?</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: I forgot what I was going to say.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: This is me at my second birthday party
with my mom and my dad. That’s my cake.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: This is me with my mom at the zoo and
this is my dad and me and my grandpa Willie.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: And this is me and my dad and my
grandpa Willie at my dad’s office.</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: Where’s your gun?</p>
<p><strong>little boy</strong>: Yeah, where is your gun?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I’m assuming that there are no bad guys in
this room. Isn’t that right? I mean, are you guys good guys or bad
guys?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Right. So why would I have brought my gun to
a room full of good guys?</p>
<p><strong>miss ross</strong>: What’s that picture?</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: This is me and my dad playing
Battleship at my dad’s apartment.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Mick?</p>
<p><strong>mick</strong>: What is a battleship?</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: My parents are divorced.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: But that’s OK `cause the most
important thing is to know that everybody loves each other.</p>
<p><strong>miss ross</strong>: So, who’s that in that picture up on
top?</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: That’s my fish, his name is Jaws and
he’s a really mean fish.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: My mommy is a Think Tank worker and
she is really, really smart. She went to two colleges and has three
computers.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: This is the day that my daddy says is
the happiest day of his life.</p>
<p><strong>miss ross</strong>: Really. His happiest day! Can you tell us
about that day, Mr. Fleury?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I sure can. That was December 4th and
that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for
this guy right here to come out of Kevin’s mom’s tummy. And we waited
and waited but he wouldn’t come and we kept waiting and finally the
doctor said `OK…he’s not gonna come out on his own so we got to go get
him.’ And well,</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Can I tell this story?</p>
<p><strong>miss ross</strong>: Go for it.</p>
<p><strong>miss ross</strong>: Then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>lu lu</strong>: What did they do?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: They started to pull and pull and
pull… they had something in there and it started coming and they were
pulling and the doctor all of the sudden said “STOP!”</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: They stopped pulling and the doctor
looked up at me and said `Hey, Mr. Fleury - you ready to have your world
rocked?’ And I just stared at her and she pulled this little head up out
of that belly. And it was him. His head. And I looked down at him and
screamed “Kevin!!” And he looked down at me and screamed “Daddy!!”</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: a lean, 27 year-old Middle-Eastern
Policeman in-command of the Entrance. Sweats through his uniform. A
late-model Range Rover with blacked-out windows queues up. All the
windows roll down: just a single, portly White WOMAN behind the wheel,
her INFANT CHILD in a car-seat in front. Two other Uniformed Officers
mirror-scan the bottom of the Rover.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: How are you today, Sergeant?</p>
<p><strong>haytham</strong>: Sun is shining. Wind is blowing. How bad
can I be doing?</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: I like that, “Sun is shining…”</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Hang up the phone. If they’re not ready
now, no words will change it.</p>
<p><strong>step it up now!</strong>: Ready for my knuckle-curve?</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Don’t stop watching the game.</p>
<p><strong>driver</strong>: You have a copy of the duty rost-</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: I said keep watching the game.</p>
<p><strong>grandfather</strong>: Our Time is not a peaceful one. God has
left it to us to make it so.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Fran?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: You getting this yet?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Hey, I’m at Kevin’s school. What’s
goin’ on?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: I’m sorry, Brother. Riyadh. Many Dead.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Where exactly?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: The Al-Rahmah Western Housing Compound. Oil
Company employees. Hit a company picnic.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Big. Broad daylight. Blew up a softball game.
Kids, Brother.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Dad?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>fran</strong>: Just went off – twenty minutes ago. Two
bombers. A Shooter crew as diversion…it’s just awful.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Fran, I’m rollin’ right now. Let me
call you back: I gotta ring bells</p>
<p><strong>fran manner</strong>: Go. I’ll be here.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Son, I gotta go to work.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: We’re gonna do ceramics…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I gotta go to work…</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Who was that?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Big Fran – you remember him?</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Uncle Fran? Put peanuts in his Coke so
he could drink and eat all at the same time?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Where he’s from in South Carolina
that’s called fine-dining, Bud.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Something bad.</p>
<p><strong>kevin</strong>: `Lotta bad people out there…’</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: You gonna go see him?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m gonna try…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Can you get a ride?</p>
<p><strong>miss ross</strong>: Where’s your husband going?</p>
<p><strong>lyla fleury</strong>: Ex-husband, and God knows.</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Fran. You gotta stand Big Man…</p>
<p><strong>francis manner</strong>: Rex, how old were you when your hat
was that small?</p>
<p><strong>rex burr</strong>: You gotta stand, Big Man.</p>
<p><strong>francis manner</strong>: We need to get everyone back, then
get all their-</p>
<p><strong>glenda</strong>: It was… I don’t know what time it was… the
dishwasher’s broken…I was waiting for the dishwasher… The doorbell rang
- I thought it was… it wasn’t the dishwasher guy…It wasn’t. It
wasn’t.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Glenda, I want you to look at me.</p>
<p><strong>a pause</strong>: Fleury freezes up on a shock of raw
emotion, struggling to contain himself.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Please… I’m going to take care of this.
Whoever did this… I give you my word. Whoever did this will pay. I can’t
change this, but I can promise you that I will make someone pay for
this.</p>
<p><strong>cnn reporter</strong>: …1 hour ago: blasts in Saudi Arabia,
in or around the
<code>Al- Rahmah' western housing complex near Riyadh. More than 100 feared dead, including children. The Saudi Foreign Minister has released a statement calling this a</code>heinous
act possibly committed by foreigners…’</p>
<p><strong>bbc reporter</strong>: …homes to thousands of Westerners and
other non-Saudis who work in the Kingdom, there have been several
attacks on these compounds in the last five years. As such, they have
become very tight in terms of security, with both the Saudi National
Guard and police taking command.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+
injured. The target was a softball game. Rumor is the Killers wore Saudi
police uniforms. Special Agent Fran Manner was killed.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: So was Rex Burr from State.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Fran was the best among us…we’ll feel
this loss the rest of our days… Grant, take stabs at bomb sizes.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: From the craters, looks like they used
a High Explosive… possibly military grade: can’t fit that much TNT into
a vest. 20, 30 pounds of</p>
<p><strong>petn</strong>: they got it. Semtex or C-4: they could get it.
The third there, God knows…that crater looks like a plane dropped a
500-pounder…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Obviously a secondary blast after the
initial devices used to lure first responders to the scene. Don’t know
anything about where or what it was yet.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: This is how they do it.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: I already know the answer, but any
chance in Hell we get to go over there, use our hands?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: If you already know the answer Adam,
why ask the question?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: We’re not seeing this kind of planning and
execution anywhere else…these ain’t hot-wired artillery shells waiting
for Humvees to roll by. These hits are coordinated: planning, timing,
and big, broad- daylight balls-</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Yeah, So… did they all happen during
daylight?</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: Yes. At least the first parts of the
attacks.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: We had two others…North of Riyadh and
the oil thing. What was that?</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: The Refinery… Ras Tenura Refinery.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing:
daylight, suicide bombers. Right?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Same thing. Followed by machine gun
crews. Collect and kill.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: This is not new in concept. It is new
in scope. It’s bigger. Very sophisticated. Command and control was
flawless. They found the largest kill zone they could and they did it…
they did it by being patient.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Any rumors or confirmations of
uniforms being used in the other two attacks?</p>
<p><strong>agent #1</strong>: No. I know this is the first for that.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: That’s `worst case scenario’ if you’re
still asking for my stab, Sir. A crew who can build bombs this big, with
this level of eyes- on control and detonation coordination… has access
to Saudi uniforms now…I mean…Baby Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: Anyone take credit?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin-
Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq. Now
he seems to have come home. He’s clearly becoming increasingly
active…</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: If it is Hamza, he’s definitely
turning up the volume over there.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Not to beat a dead horse, Sir, but if
there was ever a time to get boots on Saudi sand…</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: They can’t afford to appear as if they
are losing any kind of control. They lose control over their country,
their people…then they risk losing control over the oil. They won’t let
us in. No way.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: From the State Department, one hour
ago: `We are in agreement with the Saudi security assessment that any
additional American presence on Kingdom soil represents reckless risk.
Therefore it is the Secretary of State’s position that only after the
situation has been evaluated and contained, should the Federal Bureau of
Investigation activate Rapid Deployment.’ The National Security Advisor
and the Attorney General agreed. I’m going to get us access. Keep your
go bags hot. It’s gonna come fast.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Well… I guess he’s gonna go get us
some access. How’s he gonna do that?</p>
<p><strong>general abdul-malik</strong>: No falsehoods, Sergeant
Haytham. What was your involvement?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: Killing those I saw
responsible.</p>
<p><strong>general abdul-malik</strong>: So none could be
questioned?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: I don’t understand.</p>
<p><strong>general abdul-malik</strong>: You were born and raised in
Suweidi-</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: -that is not a crime-</p>
<p><strong>general abdul-malik</strong>: -it should be.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: It’s not.</p>
<p><strong>general abdul malik</strong>: Do you know Abu Hamza?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: I do not.</p>
<p><strong>general abdul-malik</strong>: Your brother was killed
fighting the Americans. True or false?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: I am not my brother.</p>
<p><strong>general abdul-malik</strong>: Your brother–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: I am NOT my brother!</p>
<p><strong>general abdul-malik</strong>: TRUE or-</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: He has answered the question.</p>
<p><strong>general abdul-malik</strong>: We found six more uniforms than
you were assigned in your possession – that is a crime: especially when
you consider the Attackers wore our Uniform…</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: Uniforms?</p>
<p><strong>general abdul-malik</strong>: Truth!</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: I sweat. I’ll say it again because
it is true. I need more uniforms because I must change during
shifts…look at my shirts.</p>
<p><strong>general abdul-malik</strong>: I am not interested in your
sweat.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: -then look at my jackets. Please.
Permanent stains…no matter how many times they’re cleaned…</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: He’s telling the truth.</p>
<p><strong>general adbul-malik</strong>: You were injured when you used
your vehicle to protect your country. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Look at me, Haytham.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: You saved lives today. I believe
that. You served your country. I believe that.</p>
<p><strong>haytham</strong>: I love my country.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I believe that, Haytham…</p>
<p><strong>haytham</strong>: I love my country…</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: You will have your revenge for
what needed to be done to assure them you weren’t involved.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: Everyone’s terrified, so nothing
moves. Paralysis. You and your team aren’t going anywhere. And this
meeting is just a circle- jerk, Ronnie: Attorney General Young’s going
to go through the motions because protocol says we get an appeal. We’ll
be on record, but expect nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: Can you handle this? Keep your mouth
shut when people way above you say things you’ll hate?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Yeah, sure. No problem.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: What about Agent Mayes?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Ask her.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: I’ll be fine.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: I apologize if we’re late-</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: They were early.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: You know Special Agent Fleury?</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: This is agent Janet Mayes, she’s one
of our Arabic experts.</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: OK. The latest.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Two suicide bombers. Rumors they were
dressed as Saudi Police. We believe this is the work of Saudi terrorist
named Abu Hamza.</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: A Shooter crew served as distraction.
After the initial attack there was a lull to allow Saudi Emergency
Teams…and our own attaches…to collect. Then a secondary blast was
triggered, aimed at those first responders. So they targeted families
and rescuers with one attack. I think that’s a clear signal that their
definition of `Enemy’ is expanding.</p>
<p><strong>maricella canavesio</strong>: My God.</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: Let us never forget how cheap life is
over there. Now…I have seven minutes before my next meeting, so who’s
talking first? You two digested the memo?</p>
<p><strong>ellis leach</strong>: I’ll go first if that’s okay Maricella?
First, I’m sorry about Fran Manner.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: As we are about Rex Burr.</p>
<p><strong>ellis leach</strong>: I met with Prince Thamer at the Saudi
embassy fifteen minutes after I heard this morning’s news. After
speaking with Thamer, I advised we withhold additional US personnel
because a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the
presence of current US personnel. More boots on Saudi soil make an
already combustible situation more so. I know that’s not the answer you
want, but…</p>
<p><strong>maricella canavesio</strong>: My two cents: The Saudis
haven’t asked for FBI help. Sounds like they’ve done just the opposite.
If we force the issue, that could further anger an utterly important
ally that shares a 1000-mile long border with Iraq.</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: It’s all rock-solid logic.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: We would just like to be on record
as saying we think we should go</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: That’s not going to happen</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: -so as we present this to the public,
let’s - as best we can - try to view this through an FBI Agent’s eyes.
And please let me know if there’s anything else we can do for you.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Sir, how would you imagine it looks
viewed through an FBI agents eyes?</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: Pardon me?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m interested in how you think this
situation is viewed through our eyes.</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: It’s some variation on vengeance… When
one of your own is killed, Agents lose their analytical powers - kind of
a greatest strength, greatest weakness thing…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: If I wanted vengeance, I’d have
whispered `Rex Burr’ into Ellis’s ear right when we walked in.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: This isn’t Terrorism, ma’am. It’s
just Serial Murder.</p>
<p><strong>maricella canavesio</strong>: What’s the distinction?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: To call this massacre an act of
terrorism… that implies a specific political agenda. To me, these
killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly
sociopathic- more like Charles Manson than Osama Bin Laden…</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this
war, so a new, zero-sum phase has begun: if you won’t join us, we’ll let
loose the truly talented Murderers… Abu Hamza. He will kill so many of
you that the resulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause
an exodus, a rebellion, both. Because the Royal Family simply cannot
protect you or yours any longer.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: When she says talented, she’s not
talking about the walking-bombs who can sneak past any and all security,
nor the hi-jackers tough enough to take an airliner. We’re talking about
the Man who teaches them how…</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: –the operational commander who
organizes, trains, plans, encourages. That is who we’re fighting.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: If we don’t get inside Saudi Arabia
within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for
Al-Rahmah. None.</p>
<p><strong>ellis leach</strong>: Okay. I believe it all. So doesn’t your
team in that country represent the kind of target one of these `Masters’
would die for? Trade ten of their own for one of you?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: To not engage these criminals out of
fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.’</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’ll say it another way: Evidence
starts to go cold after twenty four hours. If we can’t get in now, we
will not find the man or men responsible for this crime. We couldn’t do
it at Khobar; we couldn’t do it in Yemen; we have barely scratched the
surface in Iraq. And we are on verge of not doing it here. They are
getting stronger, we are getting weaker. I just lost a very good friend
and I would very much like to go and do my job.</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: That was spirited… let’s all thank God
Special Agent Fleury doesn’t make policy decisions. He’d turn the FBI
into Patton’s Third Army.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: I see the look in your eyes. That
look is trouble: old school, play ground shit, vengeance…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: It’s not vengeance.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: It ain’t justice. It’s stronger.
We’ve all been there. I have. Vengeance is always dirty, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I just can’t sit this out. I can’t
watch this not get dealt with. Not again. Know what my high school
football coach used to say to me?</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: “HIT SOMETHING.” All night long,
Coach Bailey would scream “HIT SOMETHING.” Every play.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: That’s good coaching.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m fixing to go hit something, boss.
You with me?</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: How you gonna do it?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: The Saudis covet good PR as much as
their Oil: 15 of 19 hijackers on 9- 11 means most Americans will never
stop asking if that Saudi Oil is worth it. It’s all about press.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: Few more moves and it’s Total War,
Ronnie. The only time Treason is palatable is when it’s done righteously
and completely…</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Oh, I’m in…Not a question. I’m
definitely going.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: What’s your take?</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: Looks like every overthrow in
history: once the guys with the guns are no longer trustworthy, the
government’s days are numbered.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: White House call you with a spin?</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: You kidding? We don’t talk since I
broke the Vice President’s guy cooking dirty intel on Iran. They hate
me. What’s up, Fleury?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: How hard you gonna hit the Royal
Family in your column tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: With a sledgehammer.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: With the bombings? Or other
things…</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: What’s “other” than the
bombings?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I know you’re tracking Al
Haramain.</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: Is that what you want to talk about?
Saudi officials making donations that end up… What? Blowing up trains in
Paris? Buses in London?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Sometimes. Seems that just might
happen.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: We got some other stuff: Missing
girls out of a Houston Four Seasons Hotel that was heavily populated by
some “Saudi officials.” Little things…</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: Murder…Hookers…Houston? Can I take
some notes?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m not saying that.</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: Are you saying anything?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I need a favor.</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: I don’t do favors, Ronnie.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: When it’s real and it will be real…
I’ll come to you with what we have first. It’s yours. Exclusive.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: You call Thamer at the Embassy. Tell
him that the FBI is getting real close to laying out some major Saudi
VIP indictments relating to newly uncovered charity financing out of a
Boston investment firm. We’re gonna freeze a lot of Saudi cash and roll
out some major embarrassment.</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: Can I mention Houston?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: It’s a free world, baby. Ask him to
comment.</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: He won’t.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Tell him that I’m running the
investigation.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Tell him that I’m not the nicest kid
on the block.</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: That would be accurate.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I want fifteen minutes with him
tonight.</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: Wow. OK. And I get what?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I come to you first. No one else.</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: What’s really going on here, Ronnie?
You going strong over Fran Manner?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m just trying to do my job, Elaine.
That’s it. Call Thamer.</p>
<p><strong>elaine flowers</strong>: I’ll see what I can do.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Get back in.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Too many people we both know were at
the bar. It’s a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: I had an interesting conversation
with a reporter from the Post.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: She can be a bit of an exaggerator…
I’m sure things were somewhat over-stated. I see myself as friend of
Saudi Arabia. I just need a little cooperation, that’s all.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: What kind of cooperation??</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Full cooperation: my Team cleared to
land at Prince Sultan Air Base. Tomorrow. We want to help in a very
muscular way, quickly.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: Next month would be as soon as…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: This goes one of two ways. First: The
FBI with the White House go on the kind of aggressive PR “Saudi Royal
Family Decaying Monarchy” bender that just can’t help but hurt. Really
hurt. And I don’t care how many Chinese are lined up to buy the oil. You
know it’s gonna hurt.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: My family is not decaying-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: And then we bring the hammer down
hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we got direct links from Riyadh - two
wives donating ten million to three Arab-American cultural centers in
Boston. Then what gets kind of not- funny is how some of that cash found
its way to Jakarta and some Mosques that have these training camps built
right next to them. It’s kinda funny… you got little kids playing over
here, and some not so little kids playing with guns over here. That’s
kinda odd.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: You have no proof of this.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: We’re getting there, Sir. And I
haven’t even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston. This
is big. It is real. And I know you only care so much about public
American opinion, Sir. But the story will be covered… Big…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: And this ain’t the Metro section.
It’s above the fold, just below the date. Words like these get
syndicated to papers like the Omaha World-Herald, The Terrell Tribune –
You ever been to Terrell, Texas?</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: What is your point?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Last I heard, 112 people lost their
lives in your country. One of them was a good friend of mine. I want in
and I want in immediately.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: Define “immediately.”</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Right now immediately.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: If your phone doesn’t work international,
you can borrow mine.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I’ll just be right out here.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: We cannot allow 100 agents-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: -4. With a 25-man security
detail-</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: -even 25 more armed Americans could
spark rebellion-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: That’s too bad.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: Saudi Security. That’s non
negotiable. You cannot bring guns into the Kingdom.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Men in Saudi Police uniforms are why
we’re talking now.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: They would be hand picked.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Whose hands?</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: Trust me…that’s the only hope of this
happening.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: If anything happens to me or my team… It’s
on you. Understood?</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: Cool it with the John Wayne,
Mr. Fleury.</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: You can have a week-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: -seven-day or work-week?</p>
<p><strong>prince thamer</strong>: Work week. Five days. No guns.</p>
<p><strong>old voice</strong>: Just in time.</p>
<p><strong>haytham’s father</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: You haven’t heard about the
attack?</p>
<p><strong>haytham’s father</strong>: I choose not to listen anymore.
What happened to your face?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: An attack today.</p>
<p><strong>haytham’s father</strong>: Look at me.</p>
<p><strong>haytham’s father</strong>: Is this how they now treat the men
who protect them? Can you look at me? You cannot, can you? Can you look
at yourself?</p>
<p><strong>haytham’s father</strong>: You are protecting the true
enemies of God.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: What was Fran Manner to her?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: He taught her how to shoot, she taught
him most everything else. Celebrated graduation at the IHOP in-town
until some Townie called Janet something…Something not very nice. Townie
didn’t see Fran coming outta the Head. But he definitely felt Fran’s
uppercut shatter his jaw.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Fran didn’t get bounced for that?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: SAC Fleury took care of him.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: If I knew how I’d be SAC Sykes. I do
know the post in Riyadh was part of the deal Fleury cut to save Fran’s
career.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: What did SAC Fleury whisper in your
ear this morning?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: `Grant’s age is a liability.’</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Thanks for volunteering.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: Actually, I didn’t volunteer.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Thanks anyway.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: We’re going to Riyadh?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: State department said yes?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: White House said yes?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: Anybody said yes?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: Are we bringing security?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: This is going to suck so bad.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: What can four people do in five days?
Really?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Aren’t you the one who demanded to go
this morning?</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: I meant the FBI. I didn’t mean
“me.”</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: What’s it like on the ground?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Mars.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: I’ll be looked at with what I can only
describe as disdain, pretty much the entire time we’re on the ground…
kind of like South Virginia.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Go easy on my kin.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: It’s a very confused culture. Extremely
religious. Had nothing; wanted nothing. Sixty years ago, they hit oil.
Simple religious men become trillionaires… a schizophrenic nation is
born. The royal family, who we back, and everyone else.</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: Four FBI Agents will be allowed
to land at Prince Sultan Air Base this evening.</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: General Abdul-Malik, Chief of
Investigative Services for the National Guard has been put in- charge of
solving this crime.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I know the General. I attended his
interrogation of one of my men. The General does not have investigative
experience.</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: Attackers wore YOUR uniform.
Police Uniforms. Some of your men may have been involved with this Cell,
may still be involved. You’re lucky to have a role at all.</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: And your role will be critically
important: make sure the Americans leave our country as alive as when
they arrive. Five days they will be our guests. Understood?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: What’s going on in there?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m good.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Feels like you got a beast in there,
Fleury.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m good</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: “Good” is 6:00 am Sunday morning when
your kid climbs into your bed, buries himself into you… sun’s creeping
through the windows - soft. Birds and wind-chimes… that’s “good.”</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m OK…You don’t think I’m OK?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: I think you’re not entirely clear right
now. That’s OK, but you got to know that. You want to go - we go. I got
you, but you got to check yourself.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m checked.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: OK. I’m just checking that you
checked.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: How we doing?</p>
<p><strong>pilot #1</strong>: About a half hour out.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: They gonna let us land?</p>
<p><strong>pilot #1</strong>: We’ve been talking to them about an hour
or so… they know we’re coming.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>pilot #1</strong>: You don’t mind my asking, but what the
hell you all gonna be doing down there?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Hunting…</p>
<p><strong>pilot #1</strong>: Hunting…? I think of hunting, I think
quail in Tennessee, deer in Pennsylvania. What kind of hunting you all
gonna do in Saudi?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Big Game hunting.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Heads on a swivel.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Colonel Al-Ghazi.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Special Agent Ronald Fleury.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Your two fallen comrades,
Mr. Manner and Mr. Burr.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Passports and credentials.
Please.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Thank you to keep these on
whenever you are outside of Al-Rahmah.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: We brought our own.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Israeli stamp in my passport?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: That is not our concern.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I’m also to collect your
sidearms.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: And I usually just toss it on the
kitchen table…</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: If each of you would please get
into the middle vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Wouldn’t need the power a’ prayer if
there were 2 hands on the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>adam leaviit</strong>: 110 miles per hour… How do you keep so
calm? I mean, really? Is it breathing–</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: –Shhhh….</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: If somebody was tailing us it’d be
obvious. This is just standard operating speed.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Colonel, have you ever been to
the</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I have been there only once. I
spent four days at Quantico… I saw your Michael Jordan play for the
Washington Wizards.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: You don’t know what you missed… you
should have seen him play for our Chicago Bulls.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: in control, using Sykes to ask the questions
he “diplomatically” does not want to ask.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: You have portable lights on-scene?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Yes. But your team cannot work
nights.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: We only have seven days: we work around
the clock.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Five days. And you are not safe at
night.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: We’re safe during the day?</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: I don’t like camels.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Colonel, do you believe Abu Hamza was
responsible for this attack?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: We don’t know.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Were Saudi Police involved in the
attack?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: We don’t know that either.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Any word on what that third big blast
was?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: You interviewed witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: We’re trying. No one who was close
enough to see the things we would like to know, lived.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Were any of the uniformed bombers
brother-officers?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Do you know yet?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: You don’t know the source of the
blast, don’t know if your own Officers were involved, but you won’t let
us work nights?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: 47 of my `brother-officers’ were
blown into hundreds of pieces that will take months to collect. 80,000
Officers total, across the country, at four uniforms apiece. Thousands
of people who can sew forgeries. Apologies that I don’t have definitive
answers. You’re still not working nights.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: Good afternoon, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: `Sunlight is indeed the most powerful
disinfectant.</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: In that spirit I come before this
Judiciary Committee with a painful admission. Simply: I’ve lost all
confidence in the FBI, especially it’s uppermost echelon. Entrenched and
outmoded, the Leadership has shown itself fearful of the pioneering
thought this Committee and I have tried to imbue. It is thus an Agency
at contretemps, hindering our every effort.’ And by `Committee’ I mean
the fucking SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: Senators? Then I’d change
<code>outmoded' to</code>outdated,’ <code>echelons' to</code>ranks’ and
what in God’s name is `contretemps?’ These guys aren’t the best and
brightest-</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: -never take the Lord’s name in vain in
this office-</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: -but you can say `Fucking?’</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: You’re going to the Senate Select
Committee, but not to the President who appointed you. Why’s that? I bet
the President wasn’t the audience you thought he’d be: I’ll bet he
realized you can’t have Voters asking why the second- longest serving
FBI Director gets fired for doing his job, for sending Agents into Saudi
Arabia, seven months from mid-term elections-</p>
<p><strong>gideon young</strong>: -you really want to bet?</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: Westmoreland made all us Officers
write our own obituaries during Tet, when it looked like the Cong were
going to end it all right there. Once we clued-in that life was finite,
the loss of it no longer scared us: the end comes no matter what, it’s
just a question of how you want to go out: on your feet or on your
knees. After that, we went out and pulled triggers until barrels melted.
And Vietnam lasted another seven years. The lesson extends to this
career: I ACT, knowing the end of this job will come, no matter what.
You should do the same.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: I’ll forward Fleury’s reports.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: That’s one of the great horrors of
television: Crime scene manipulation. They say a TV camera adds pounds
to actresses. Isn’t that what they say?</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Who’s “they?”</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: That is what they say. Doesn’t add to
crime scenes. Television cameras shrink them. Misrepresent. No smells.
Poor sound. Limited view. TV always makes them look smaller. You can’t
feel the hatred on television.</p>
<p><strong>tight on fleury</strong>: Quiet and focused, taking
everything in.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: …heads on a swivel, people.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The bathrooms are through that
door. I will be here tomorrow morning so we can begin.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: What time tomorrow morning?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Sunrise.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: What time is sunrise?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: When I knock.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: That’s against fire code.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: They don’t have fire codes. They don’t
have codes other than codes of war. They’ll lock us in and dial up some
kind of earth movers if they want to. You know that, Sykes. Dig a big
hole and push us in. Fill it up and no one comes calling. You’re in the
jungle now, baby.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: You alright, girl?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Watch it, boy.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Just asking…</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Unpack.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Saudi slow roll…</p>
<p><strong>lyla fleury</strong>: Hello?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Hey… How are you? How’s my boy?</p>
<p><strong>lyla fleury</strong>: We’re just fine. How are you? Where are
you?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m here… Lemme talk to my boy.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: What you doing?</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: I’m talking to you. What are you doing
right now, Daddy? Right now?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I’m missing you.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I’m in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Did you see Big Fran?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Yeah… I saw him…</p>
<p>****: I saw him.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Is he still tall?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Yeah… Yeah…he’s still tall.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Daddy? Are you still there?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Yeah, buddy. I love you. Keep your eye on
your mama. Be the man.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: You, too Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I’ll call you tomorrow. I love you.</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Bye, Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: You are in so much trouble.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Is that right?</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: For sure. I mean, I don’t know how you did
it. Nice work, but if you live through this, which I put at about fifty
percent - if you do, your balls are gonna get stretched and beaten on.
Dig that?</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: Damon Schmidt. State Department. I’m in
charge of getting you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: Don’t let go of his hand first. Major
disrespect.</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: This is our level of commitment
to bringing Terrorists to justice:</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: We’ve invited American legal
officials into our Kingdom despite current difficulties between the US
and Islam. They will observe our advanced investigative techniques,
offering helpful hints. You will please honor me with your presence
tonight at my home. Yes.</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: Nice pictures. You guys ready to go home
now?</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: OK. If you change your minds, I got a plane
fueled up and ready to go - got your name all over it…</p>
<p><strong>schmidt</strong>: Strap your kevlar on tight, people.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Slow roll… gonna be like when you go
deep sea fishing in Florida and you pay seven hundred bucks for the boat
and you sit in the ocean for hours and the crew jumps around and screams
and points and you think your constantly about to bag a Marlin but you
never do and they keep pointing and jumping and-</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Enough.</p>
<p><strong>police officer</strong>: You’re willing to die to protect
your enemy?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: What did the Prince say?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: That there are more rules than
just not working at night.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: What rules?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: You are here as observers. Not
investigators.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: That’s not accurate–</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: –I need to make sure the sites are
secure. Then you can begin observing.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: How could they get more secure?</p>
<p><strong>tight on fleury</strong>: focused, Thinking. Sykes next to
him.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Well, this is going well…</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Saudi Slow Roll.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Good.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: How do you do that?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: Don’t say `good’ again.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: Bueno.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I am sorry for the time. You won’t
need you gear.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Of course we won’t.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The remaining rules: you cannot
touch evidence, question anyone without me present, touch Muslim dead,
or leave my sight at anytime: your safety is my primary concern.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I would have thought your primary concern
was investigating a crime.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: And you would be mistaken.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: I think it’s one of those “something happens
to us… his head comes off” kind of deals. Is it one of those kind of
deals, Colonel?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: So, if you’re not running the
investigation…who is?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The National Guard’s Military
Police Brigade is conducting the investigation. My orders begin and end
with your health.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: I thought the SANG were soldiers–</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: –the bombers didn’t wear a
soldier’s uniform. They wore mine.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Who is in charge of the investigation
then?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: General Abdul-Malik. He’s given us
permission to walk through each crime-scene.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: To walk through? Are you kidding
me?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I am not.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Get him over here now and let’s
clarify this situation.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: There is no lack of
clarification.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: There sure as hell is! I don’t know
what kind of game you’re playing but you got the wrong guy, Colonel
Al-Ghazi! That was not the deal-</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: This is not a game show,
Mr. Fleury! There are no deals made here. There is me telling you what
you may or may not do and there is you doing it.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: You will be permitted to walk
through the crime scenes. When we have determined that it is safe.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: How have you guys been doing with the
witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: What witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I’m guessing there are a bunch of Americans,
Brits… Australians? Someone must have seen something. I’m sure they’re
just dying to talk to you guys, seeing as how the killers were wearing
your uniforms. That must be a real confidence booster for them.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Let me talk to them.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: There’s still a couple of hundred of us living
on the compound.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Why Saudi Arabia?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Neither of us did anymore schooling than
Electra High, Electra Texas.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: And the jobs here pay twice what you’d make in
Midland or the Gulf a’ Mexico. Plus the house is free.</p>
<p><strong>janine ripon</strong>: I call it combat pay. This place has
gone Guns - Guns - Guns.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: So has Everyone else now.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: My girlfriends in Texas spend their combat
pay on diamonds… I spent mine on a safe room.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Two nights back. Can you start one
second before you knew anything was wrong?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: We didn’t really see anything. Just hit the
ground and hustled to the safe room. Closed our eyes and prayed. It was
so fast. So loud.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: So you really didn’t see
anything.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: I hit the deck. Horrible.</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Not `til after. Just the screams–</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: – the kids… they were screaming. That got me
out of the house. Those kids.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Which kids were those?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: The Jackson kids. Tracy Jackson next door
was murdered looking out her window…front of her children. No safe room
over there… Not even the Men that did this should die in front a’ their
babies.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: She live with her husband?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: If I’m facing your house, is the
Jackson home to the right or left?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: Left.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Mr. Aaron Jackson?</p>
<p><strong>aaron jackson</strong>: Get him away from me-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: -easy, Sir. He’s a friend to us-</p>
<p><strong>aaron jackson</strong>: -I don’t know either one a’ you.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m Special Agent Ronald Fleury of
the FBI. This is Colonel Al-Ghazi with the Saudi State Police-</p>
<p><strong>aaron jackson</strong>: -the Police: they attacked.</p>
<p><strong>aaron jackson</strong>: I just put my boys down for the first
time in two days. I can’t wake `em and sure as hell can’t be gone if
they stir on their own.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Can I come back?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Your boys…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: To ask about two nights ago.</p>
<p><strong>aaron jackson</strong>: When my wife’s jaw was shot off in
front of our sons? My sons who sat with her while she bled to death?
Couldn’t speak because she didn’t have the bottom of her face and I
wasn’t home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year-
old had a box of band-aids in his hand when I finally got home?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: …I won’t pretend to know…</p>
<p><strong>aaron jackson</strong>: Kill everyone that had something to
do with this. Everyone related to them. Everyone who knew them. And all
you’d be doing is their recruiting for them… It’s an entire generation:
not small and isolated like they say. But a generation that thinks what
they did to my wife, to my children, is a “calling”…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Up the street, there was a wreck, did
you see any-</p>
<p><strong>aaron jackson</strong>: -notice how it wouldn’t take a lot to
disguise your friend as a Mexican? Think he couldn’t handle crossing our
deserts? Look around!</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Aaron-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Can we tour the compound? Can we
please do that?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: He or she almost made it.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Makes me think of the Trade Centers –
the people on the floors above the impacts – no matter how fast or
strong or smart you are, if you’re in the wrong spot, `it’ will not let
you get away.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: That’s what makes this a War.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: About one hour into the
rescue.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Hit a water main?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: No – from the tanks of this fire
engine: that’s the water that didn’t evaporate in the blast.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Hole is the case. See, there’s
“evidence” down in that hole. You understand evidence? Little things
that are “clues.” Clues can be very helpful to a fella when he’s trying
to solve a crime.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I understand that.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Glad to hear it. So can we get in
there?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: A little high…</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Watt-tee…</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Watt-tee fuck is his gun doing up so
high?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: This vehicle was stolen. Two
drivers murdered. A team outside the blast-radius…shooting at anything.
Everyone. Sergeant Haytham ended this part.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Are the Shooters in-custody-</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: -dead.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Were any of these shooters your men?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: They got into the compound. Somehow…took
control of this vehicle. I’m guessing they didn’t politely ask whoever
was in this car if they could take it for a little ride?</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: No, they didn’t. There were two officers
in the car. Both were executed.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I understand that. Those men were your
men–</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: – they were. They were Police.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Where was this car when they hit it?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Security is a combination of the
police and military.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Good news is that if he shoots you,
he’s gonna shoot you sitting on an American tank… with an American- made
bullet. So, it’s kind of “all in the family.”</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: How about we get into those American
Suburbans… with their American A/C…</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: The car was parked here?</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Backed in?</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: They were attacked from the front. Must have
assumed the killers were fellow officers… Have any of these men been
identified?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Not yet. We will check certain
neighborhoods. It is likely that the four men prayed at the same
Mosque.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: The same Mosque is enough to identify
them, link them to a cell?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Yes. If the Mosque is in
Suweidi.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Suweidi?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Suweidi is a known militant stonghold.
Al-Qaeda could recruit from storefronts.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Can we go to check out some of these
surrounding buildings?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Seems reasonable that the Planner had to
observe and based on Hamza’s past history, it’s consistent that he would
want to video the attack. Is that true? Is that accurate?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: That is true.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Well, in order to video, in order to
observe, you need a view.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: That building sees all three crime
scenes.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: It’s outside the walls-</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: -c’mon now. This is insane: we got
enough security to invade Suweidi, let alone that building-</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: -no you don’t.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Could you ask?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: We’re already seeing the crime- scenes
individually – why not all at once?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Any answer will take-</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: -time. I understand.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: You have to ask the General, then the
General would ask the Prince. Does it go higher or is that… is the
Prince the end of the chain?</p>
<p><strong>highly effective</strong>: Al-Ghazi nods `yes’ to the strange
half- question.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: We’ll be at the Community Center. Janet,
wanna play hoops?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: This is the kind of radical
circumstance that could have seriously upped Shaq’s free throw
percentages. Take a man. Ship him off to Riyadh. No phones, constant
threat of death, no girls, no hip hop. Nothing… just free throws. Shaq,
he’d be shooting at least seventy percent. Lakers would still be
together. Kobe and Shaq lovers forever.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: Hey, Boss… check this out.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: Just posted half hour ago.</p>
<p><strong>images on the computer</strong>: ARABIC EXTREMIST WEBSITE.
Video footage shot from the rooftop of all three bombings and some of
the machine gun killings.</p>
<p><strong>leavitt</strong>: So self congratulatory. Makes me sick.</p>
<p><strong>sang officer</strong>: This is unacceptable.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: It’s cleared with General Abdul-
Malik. We have five minutes here.</p>
<p><strong>special forces officer</strong>: We were told they must
remain in the vehicles…</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: That is not true…</p>
<p><strong>special forces officer</strong>: They must stay in the
Toyotas-</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: -report me then when you get in-
touch with the General-</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Tell me it didn’t burst-tell me it
didn’t burst-</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: No blood.</p>
<p><strong>special forces officer</strong>: A disagreement.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: You’ve seen the images of the attack posted
on the internet?</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Look for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: He was here…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Formed the plan up here: saw
everything he could hit. Way too pretty a’ plan to have been fully
hatched on just one visit. He came here a couple times.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The man who did this is a Saudi -
this place, this neighborhood… if foreigners were up here, someone would
say something.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Nobody’s talking. Here, many
people love Hamza - they think of him like Bin Laden. Like your Robin
Hood.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: A man who thinks of something like
this …while maybe his family played around him… scares me more than I
have words to express. Shaytan…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Two big answers in two small minutes.
Imagine if we had a couple days together.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m sure the General is good guy…and
I’m just as sure he’s no Investigator.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Let me help you.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: We break now: too hot to work
outdoors. Then we will leave for the Palace.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: And I imagine that will run until
sundown?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I had televisions delivered to
your quarters to pass the downtime.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Miss Mayes will not attend this
evening. Men only.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: You want to tell her that?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: We’re here.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Big wall.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: It’s a big palace.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: How many Princes are there?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Over 5000.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: They all get palaces this big?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Some get bigger.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Who pays for all this?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet…</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Hey, man - I drive a Hybrid.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The Prince will ask you about your
flight, the accommodations…lite subjects. If he offers you the chance to
hold his Raptors, don’t flinch: it’s a compliment.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: What’s a Raptor?</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: His talons slice bone.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Super.</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: That’s my most prolific Hunter.
I’m trying to teach his friends there by example, but I fear it’s
something you’re born with or not. Do you agree, Mr. Ronald? Innate or
not at all?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I do.</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: What have you seen so far of our
Kingdom? – and know I can arrange tours anywhere within our borders.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’ve seen that the man who planned
the worst crime in your Kingdom’s history is without a doubt Saudi…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: ..and that if you walk 300 kilometers
from the compound, you will find a rooftop where the attacks were
planned. I’ve seen that the person in this room “born with it” is right
there… Everything I just said came from Colonel Al-Ghazi: his
observations of the scene while he was protecting us. And I think you’re
absolutely right Sir: that kind of instinct can’t be taught: not to
Falcons. Definitely not to SANG Generals. Innate or not at all. You want
the murder to stop as much as I do. Let us help.</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: Colonel Al-Ghazi, a word.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: That was impressive.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Think it will work?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Yeah. Maybe. I mean, you can only play
the “I’m going to the press card” like three more times. So, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: They’re paranoid and overly self-
protective.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: They aren’t protecting anyone.
There’s no conspiracy. They’re just terrified. Finally. The Saudis have
finally seen the Monsters they helped create, because those Monsters
have come home. And if Saudis don’t catch Saudi Monsters, that’s the
end.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: And that end could come double- quick
if they let the US “Shaytan” catch those Monsters for them. Because
that’s what the Saudi on the street suspects: the only thing keeping the
Royal Family upright is American evil.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: That’s dead on accurate. Very
impressive. That’s why they’re making it hard on us, and that’s why he
wants to help `em turn the screws.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: They can have every shred of
credit-</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: -you see the slums on the way in?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: See that even though their homes are
falling down, they had satellite dishes bolted on?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Yeah…</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: Everyone already knows you’re here.
Credit? If the Saudis cracked this Cell while these servants were
pouring coffee, Al-Jazeera still leads the story with your Team.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Have you been to the crime-scene?</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: No-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: -if you had, you’d see the evil work
of real Talent. The kind that doesn’t stop until it’s forced.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: And the path to Hell is paved with
good intentions.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: You having fun?</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: Beats hell outta visa-stamping.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: You’re on an island. I hope you know
how to get off.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: By catching Abu Hamza.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: Then here’s to you. Let’s bet: when
this Colonel Al-Ghazi comes out, he’s in-charge of the investigation -if
so, you set me up on a date with Janet Mayes.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: … every investigator on-scene by
midnight, 50 more portable lights, three more pumps-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Do me a favor and tell Janet that she
and Damon Schmidt got a date when he gets back to the States.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The rules still stand. But
tomorrow will be a new day.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: From now on, any evidence you find
you hand over.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I’m “all ears,” Special Agent
Fleury.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: We should start with the dead
shooters.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: They had no identification on
them. Fingerprints and dental have come up empty.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Can we photograph all three of them?
Couple hundred copies each…</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Good. If it’s OK with you, I’d like
to suggest we split up as follows…</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Fellas, what we want to do is get this
water out of here… see what’s really going on. Understand?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: C-VIN hunting–Data Plates– Something
drivable blew up. That’s pretty obvious. Feels like ANFO to me,
boys–Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil. Let’s dry this hole and see if we can’t
figure what she was. Gotta pump?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Got to get a little dirty, people.
Crawl up in it. Make deep contact. You get that?</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Get nasty, dirty, filthy.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Have him pass these out to the
compound security. See if anybody knows them.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Would you mind doing one more thing
for me?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: No, Sir.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Could you tell me if you recognize
any of these men?</p>
<p><strong>janine</strong>: …Horrible.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: I don’t know any of them.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: I’m just wondering. That chair out side.
Looks like it gets a lot of wear. Looks comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: That my mom’s chair.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: See, that’s exactly what I was thinking. I’m
guessing she spends a lot of time sitting outside?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: All day.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: She must pretty much see it all. Right?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: She does.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: She’s sleeping.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Let’s wake her up.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: I’ve seen him.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: Like, a week ago. Twice I’ve seen him.
Watering…With the garden crews. I remember he was wearing a Liza
Minnelli T-shirt. I thought that was funny.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: What about the others?</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: No. Just him. I remember the T- shirt. I
remember thinking it was odd…?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: What, the Liza Minelli shirt?</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: No. I do think Liza Minelli’s gone odd, but
that wasn’t it.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: What was odd?</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: He was a Saudi. The gardener.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>maddy</strong>: Saudis, like Americans, don’t do manual
labor. Blowing leaves is beneath them.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>earl</strong>: Who is he?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: That’s one of the many things we’re
trying to find out…</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: Find out if he worked with the
gardeners.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: How are your Sons?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: That’s the name of a clinical
psychologist. Works with Embassy kids…apparently very good at explaining
violence-</p>
<p><strong>aaron jackson</strong>: -what do you know about what my kids
need? What they saw? What the rest of their lives might be like?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I thought maybe your Boys…without
their Mom anymore…might ask you why sometime…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I will find the man responsible for
the death of your wife. We’re close.</p>
<p><strong>aaron jackson</strong>: Tomorrow it’ll be somebody else’s
wife.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Then tomorrow I’ll come back.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The gardener. We know who he is.
He’s on several watch lists.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: We know where he lives?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: We will very soon.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: You don’t seem very excited.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: These are always the easy ones to
catch. Rarely does it lead to the planners. I want to take you
somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Where?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: To someone who may be able to help
us catch Hamza.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: It’s a gurney.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Who’s missing an ambulance?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Could somebody please go get Sergeant
Haytham?</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Sergeant Haytham!</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Who has the keys?</p>
<p><strong>haytham</strong>: You cannot touch any Muslims.</p>
<p><strong>janet</strong>: No problem. Can I still touch Americans?</p>
<p><strong>haytham</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: What’s gas running a gallon out here,
Al-Ghazi? Penny gallon?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: It was an American. An engineer
named Karl Twitchell. Hired by Saudi Arabia to find water. He didn’t
find so much as a dried oasis, but he found this. Enough oil to turn the
earth.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: They say my country sits on over 1
trillion more barrels of recoverable oil.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: A trillion reasons for our Leaders to
hold hands another one hundred years.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: A trillion reasons to keep
fighting. For both sides of this War. I think our oil has begun
destroying more than it creates.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Agreed.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I’m 46 years-old. I have three
daughters. And I find myself in a place where I no longer care about
`why’ we are attacked. I only care that 100 people woke up a few
mornings ago had no idea it was their last. When we catch the Man who
murdered these people, I don’t care to ask even one question…I just want
to kill him…stop him. Do you understand?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Yes, I do.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Is your first name `Colonel?’</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Faris.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Feel like I’m back home in Detroit.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: At one time, Talal was Arafat’s
senior bomb-maker and planner in the occupied territories. He joined
Bin-Laden when Al Qaeda brought the fight to the Royal Family.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: OK. Shouldn’t we arrest him or shoot
him or something?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: He turned himself in last year
during an amnesty. He’s now part of a new government effort to balance
the experience of Saudi Youth.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: This place is community service?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: If America figures out a way of
keeping their kids off the computers please let us know.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Why did he turn himself in?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: `You only come after I see there
were bombs.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Did you know Bin Laden put 5
million-dollars on my head? Why shouldn’t it be 10?’</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The Man who made War on Al-Rahmah
is someone my age – this kind of skill is learned over decades.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: A Man who can plan the mass-murder
of women and children, then go home at night to his own and sleep
soundly…? That kind of Man is supremely difficult to catch.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: How does he know he slept
soundly?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Because he hasn’t stopped. You
stop when their faces don’t let you close your eyes…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Is that why you quit?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: 17 days without sleep will make
you quit anything.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: He says he makes my job easier.
Here, at least they only fight and kill on computers.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: He says that there are several
ways to get American military equipment like this detonator but not many
men in Saudi Arabia that know how to get them.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: How do they get them?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Usually smuggled from Iraq by
corrupt soldiers working with the Americans.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: Could Hamza get this equipment?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Without question. Yes, he
could.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: How do we find him?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Prayer. Luck. Handshakes.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Well, I think I get the
<code>prayer' and</code>luck’ parts…</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: His hands will feel like this.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Every Amir at some point gets
bitten by his work.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Whatever this is, it blasted-off like
NASA.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: Driven in at an angle… go
deeper…</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: `High-order explosion’ doesn’t do it
justice: what’s left a’ this looks like it was put through a
wood-chipper.</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: Hospital Identification… Ambulance
identification.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Do you know this hospital?</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Call it in.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The ambulance was reported stolen
from King Fahd Hospital last Wednesday, three days before the
bombing.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: There’s more: I told you it
wouldn’t be hard to find the soldiers.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: What you got?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The stolen ambulance had a twenty
man crew that rotated shifts on it. We checked all twenty men. One of
them, Muaath Hazmi is now of interest to us.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Because this gentleman is Fathi
Hazmi, Muaath’s brother.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Where’s Muaath?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I’m going to show you.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: We never get to do anything fun.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Sykes, I’m guessing you don’t even
remember how to load your gun.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: That’s not funny.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: She’s not trying to be funny.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: I’m a very good shot.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: I’m sure.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Neighbors clear?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Activity or communication?</p>
<p><strong>voice</strong>: Snipers have seen nothing. No telephone line
into the house.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Allahuakbar. Go.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Prints are on the other side…</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I’m not looking for prints. I’m
looking for fingers.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: He’s gone… This shrapnel look like
the stuff you pulled at the morgue?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Yeah… I pulled so much it’s hard to
remember it all.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Bolts?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Wing nuts?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Razor blades?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: -the front gates of every other
western housing compound in Riyadh.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: And Embassies: Italy, Japan,
Korea, Norway, England…</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: The Coalition…</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: These are all countries with Troops in
Iraq – Japanese and Italian embassies are under construction?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: The entire Diplomatic Quarter is
being retro-fitted to sustain bigger bomb blasts.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: -the Prince’s Convoy just showed.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: This is bullshit. You know it.
Meaningless. There’s no leader here. These are kids. That’s it.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: We’re out of here.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Yes, that’s it. Smile for the
cameras, body-bag some children. Wrap it up, but us – out. I get it.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I’m sorry.</p>
<p><strong>prince bin khaled</strong>: Only in death will our enemies
realize Allah never permits defiance of his almighty will.</p>
<p><strong>inner-circle</strong>: Take the Americans inside now and keep
them out of sight. You will be spoken to about their presence here.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: You need water?</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: You really ought not look at this.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: That fella got shot right through his
God damn nipple…</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Don’t stare too long. It’ll start
living in your dreams.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: No – I know.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: You do? How did you know we were
here?</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: The Prince has Men at Al-Rahmah.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: What Men?</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: Ask him. 3 vehicles will stay behind
when the Prince and Press leave. You’ll convoy straight to BA flights
into Dulles – last minute fares come out of your budget, by-the-by.
Tried to swing upgrades, but check at the counter.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: Turn those frowns upside down,
people. This will be pitched as a stunning Saudi-only counter-punch that
killed those responsible for Al-Rahmah. Al-Jazeera will play up an FBI
presence, we’ll play up their ties to Terror as checkmate. And everyone
that was so righteously pissed back home is gonna eat crow.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: Already a rumor that the guy who
wrote our State Department memo-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: -Ellis Leach?</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: You know him? He’s gonna be put out
to pasture: made an example of by the President to ensure all levels of
government get tough on Terror. You won the hand on the River card.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: We didn’t win shit, Schmidt. These
are teenagers… children with pictures that someone far senior has
provided them.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: -kidding me? You mean those are
Terrorist targets? Holy Wow. Momma, don’t let your children grow up to
be cowboys. Just get ready to go home and revel in the fact that for the
next few weeks your shit won’t stink.</p>
<p><strong>damon schmidt</strong>: Double or nothing that’s a
congratulatory call.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Hello? Yes, Sir. We’re all here and
healthy. I’m sitting next to their corpses but this may not be over.
These don’t feel like anything resembling senior leadership- -thank you
Sir. I do.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Please do me one favor before we
board: warn every `Coalition-of-the- Willing’ or whatever the hell we’re
calling our Iraq allies now, that pictures of their Riyadh embassies
were found in this Cell’s safe- house.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: Amateurs. It’s a small win.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’m thinking about New York -
February 26, 1993. The first time they tried to hit the Trade
Towers.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: I’m thinking about going straight to
Dan’s, gonna order six PBRs-</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: -Pabst?</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Keep it real. You ever drink PBR,
Haytham?</p>
<p><strong>haytham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Any beer?</p>
<p><strong>haytham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Now…that’s just unreasonable. Good
Police work and problem drinking are like a chicken and egg thing: which
enables the other?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Remember how we caught that cell?</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: Yes. Car bomb. He went back to pick up his
deposit on the rental car.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Four hundred dollars. For four
hundred dollars, he was caught. Stupidity. Catching the cell was easy.
Just like this. The cell came back.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: I’ll be back.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Yes, you will.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Religious demonstration in
progress. Back near the City Center.</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: I’m serious. Beer will open up your
subconscious. Canned beer especially. Give you instincts they can’t
teach-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Is he responding to the call? Dropped
back…</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Tighten up-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: You whole?</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Think so-</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: This is not right!</p>
<p><strong>grant sykes</strong>: Can’t release-</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Hands up – you’re gonna fall-</p>
<p><strong>sergeant haytham</strong>: They’re going to disappear…</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: You know Suweidi – you know how to
go fast.</p>
<p><strong>sykes</strong>: Nobody’s gonna hurt Leavitt but me.</p>
<p><strong>mercedes driver</strong>: He’s been shot! BE READY.</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: We should not be here…</p>
<p><strong>janet’s pov</strong>: scanning for the trail Suburban and the
Mercedes - she can’t help but notice the neighborhood. Halfway past an
intersection, Fleury yells:</p>
<p><strong>a shooter</strong>: black-hood, black T-shirt, old-school
red-white- black Air Jordans, snub-stock AK, an open, filthy North Face
backpack at his feet holding spare clips, God knows what else.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: A tunnel networks through all
these places… they use attached civilian Apartments, innocent
families.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: I do not like these people.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: We go in the front door. Haytham -
cover the stairs. Janet - hallway. Watch the side doors. Watch your
backs.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Is Allah on the other side of that
door?</p>
<p><strong>al-ghazi</strong>: I think were about to find out, my
friend.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Sykes is going to kick your ass.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Everybody OK?</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: There’s at least three more of them.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: It’s okay Little One.</p>
<p><strong>family</strong>: KIDS and a couple of real OLD FOLKS, all
terrified. A little boy cries by himself, huddled in a corner. The
collateral damage of random violence. Janet quick scans the room. LOCKS
EYES on the traumatized little boy, his innocence draining as she
watches. Can’t take her eyes away.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Is everyone alright?</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: It’s okay.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: Let me help you up, Old Man…</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: …Hamza.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I got you. Abu Hamza, you are
under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>nassar</strong>: You are a traitor to your country… a traitor
to your God.</p>
<p><strong>colonel al-ghazi</strong>: I am no traitor to my God. You
are.</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: …Don’t…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: …drop it, Son…please…</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: You got him. You got him… You got
him.</p>
<p><strong>haytham</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: Thank you, Lieutenant Haytham.</p>
<p><strong>haytham</strong>: May peace be with you.</p>
<p><strong>fleury</strong>: May peace be with all of us, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: We’re going to testify next Tuesday.
Fleury’s going first. I’m gonna go through it with each of you one on
one in advance - make sure we’re all on the same page. If they ask if
we’ve talked about this, the answer is unequivocally “No.” OK? You did
outstanding work over there. I’m proud of you. You hold your heads
high.</p>
<p><strong>director grace</strong>: Ronnie, you ready?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Janet… my dreams are… What did he
whisper to you?</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: In the briefing … to get you to stop
crying about Fran… before any of this… before we even got Airborne? What
did he say to you?</p>
<p><strong>aunt</strong>: Will you tell me what Grandfather whispered to
you before they took him?</p>
<p><strong>adam leavitt</strong>: Do you remember?</p>
<p><strong>janet mayes</strong>: He said… “We’ll kill them all.” will
end this.” “We will finish</p>
<p><strong>grandson</strong>: “Don’t worry: we’ll kill them all.”</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: You stop the people that hurt Uncle
Fran?</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: Did you get the bad guys, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>tight on fleury</strong>: He reaches and pulls his son close,
holding him for what might just be forever…</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: There’s a lot of bad people out there…
aren’t there, Daddy?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: Yeah, there are… But you want to know
something?</p>
<p><strong>kevin fleury</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>ronald fleury</strong>: You’re not one of them.</p>
